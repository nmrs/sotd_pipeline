## Observations

* After a breakout 2024, when it landed on the top step for the first time ever, House of Mammoth drops back to fourth this year, while Stirling takes back the top spot. After seven straight victories (2016–2022), Barrister and Mann has now settled into a very consistent second place. If you're curious what the podium challengers looked like over the past decade, here you go:

* Austere August did its part to keep Midnight Stag on the podium. Its 187 August shaves helped extend Stag’s podium streak to seven straight years. Even so, there was never much suspense about the top step: I, Rich Moose ran away with it. The r/wetshaving exclusive logged 403 shaves from 53 users, beating perennial workhorse Tabac (now on its fourth consecutive podium) by more than 100 shaves and staking out one of the clearest wins on the entire report. Here’s how the podium players have placed over the years:

* Stirling's Executive Man man surges 95 spots in the rankings to seize fourth.

* In other climbing news, Mike’s Natural jumps 32 spots to 7th among brands, powered by multiple soaps that absolutely rocket up the charts: Orange, Cedarwood & Black Pepper (+608 vs 2024), Vetiver (+184), Rose/Patchouli/Cedarwood (+457), Lime (+720), Bay Rum (+724), and Hungarian Lavender (+1206) all muscle their way into the top 100.

* Fanzine Saponifications makes about as loud a debut as you can. It lands 13th in total shaves with 524 uses from 50 users, and puts three soaps into the top 60 scents (Caravaggio, This is not a Test, and Testing… Testing) in its first full year on the Lather Log.

* Across the full year, Stirling stands alone atop the Brand Diversity table, with 33% more scents than runner-up Barrister and Mann. The race for third was much tighter: Catie’s Bubbles just edged out Talent Soap Factory, 80 to 79.

* It's a photo finish in the Soap Diversity By User contest, with u/RedMosquitoMM just clipping u/brokenjaw622 147 to 146.

* Martin de Candre Vetyver’s top-20 finish is almost entirely a one-person show: u/putneycj3 logs 112 of its 144 shaves. In related news, his 93.3% Boring Score easily earns him the Most Boring Shaver prize: 112 of his 116 shaves use MdC Vetyver, with the remaining 4 shaves spread across just two other soaps. u/SneakyPsyduck is a distant second at only 51.8% boring.

## Notes & Caveats

* Tables show all entries with 5 or more shaves to provide comprehensive coverage without artificial row limits.

* The unique user column shows the number of different users who used a given brand/soap/etc during the year.

* The Brand Diversity table details the number of distinct soaps used during the year from that particular brand, showing all brands with 5+ unique soaps.

* The change Δ vs columns show how an item has moved up or down the rankings since the previous year. = means no change in position, up or down arrows indicate how many positions up or down the rankings an item has moved compared to the previous year. n/a means the item was not present in the previous year.

* Lather Games stretches the definition of "Soap Brand" and "Scent", so take the totals at the top with a grain of salt.

## Most Boring Shaver
Boring Score is the chance that two shaves picked at random from a user used the same soap (higher means more repetitive). Effective Soaps converts that into an equivalent even-rotation count: the number of soaps they would need to use equally often to produce the same score. Example: someone can log 20 soaps but still have ~2 Effective Soaps if one soap dominates roughly 70% of their shaves and the rest are just occassional. 

For the mathematically inclined: Boring Score is a diversity/concentration index (HHI in economics, Simpson’s index in ecology). More detail at [Wikipedia: Diversity index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diversity_index).
