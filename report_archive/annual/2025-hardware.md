Welcome to your Annual SOTD Hardware Report for 2025

## Annual Summary

* 21,627 shave reports from 283 distinct shavers during 2025 were analyzed to produce this report, for an average of 76.4 (median 16.0) shaves per user.

## Observations

* Blackbird’s long climb finally pays off. After debuting at 32nd in 2016 and spending two years stuck in second place, the Blackland Blackbird takes its first annual crown in 2025 with 1,320 shaves – 116 more than the RazoRock Game Changer in second and well ahead of the Super Speed in third, which returns to the podium for the first time since its win in the inaugural 2016 contest.

* Pour one out for the Christopher Bradley. After standing on the podium for six consecutive years (and on the top step for four of them), the Karve loses the bronze by just four shaves to the Gillette Super Speed in 2025. If you’re as curious as I was about how the podium finishers have performed over time, here you go:

* Straight users are more committed than GEM shavers. Fewer shavers but ~50% more shaves per user earned Straights the silver this year.

* Gillette extends its streak to a full decade on the top step of the Razor Manufacturers podium, holding the #1 slot every year from 2016 through 2025.

* Zenith vs. Chisel & Hound is the headline brush rivalry this year. Zenith’s r/wetshaving MOAR BOAR repeats as the single most-used brush with 729 shaves from 52 users, but Chisel & Hound dominates the handle-maker standings with 2,886 shaves – roughly 13% of all logged shaves in 2025. u/Priusaurus’s Rad Dinosaur Creations also makes a statement, debuting in 8th place in the handle-maker table in its inaugural year.

* Usage is almost evenly split between synthetics and natural fibers, but naturals still have a slight edge. Synthetics account for 8,574 shaves (48% of the total), while natural fibers total 9,399, with most of that usage concentrated in badger (27%) and boar (22%).

* u/Breadheater9876 is very committed to his Tatara Muramasa + Astra Superior Platinum (Green) combo, single-handedly placing it third in the Most Used Blades in Most Used Razors contest with 356 shaves.

* Blade marathoners are still going strong. u/sgrdddy got his Nacet up to 606 uses, u/B_S80 logged 383 shaves on one Gillette Platinum, and more than ten other blades crossed the 100-shave mark

* Eight shavers delivered a perfect year, posting a shave every day in 2025. u/Impressive_Donut114 takes the crown with 440 shaves and no missed days, while u/FireDragonMonkey, u/brokenjaw622, and u/partyman97_3 share the silver at 367 shaves (and zero missed days) each.

## Notes & Caveats

* Most tables are row-limited to keep them readable and avoid max post length issues. If the final row is part of a tie, the entire tied group is included in the report.

* "Other" in the Blade Format table includes vintage reusable blades (including Rolls, Valet Auto Strop, and old-style lather catchers with wedge blades) as well as other antique proprietary blade formats (e.g. Enders Speed Blade)

* Blades recorded as just 'GEM' will be matched to 'Personna GEM PTFE' per guidance [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/19a43q7/comment/kil95r8/)

* The Personna name is [going away](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://www.badgerandblade.com/forum/threads/what-do-you-know-about-this-personna-no-longer-exists.647703/&ved=2ahUKEwiyi4n7pPKFAxXeLtAFHfNVDz8QFnoECAQQAQ&usg=AOvVaw38QYgjzknuIIIV94b6VDP5) for blades manufactured in the USA, but the majority of entries are still coming in under Personna, so I am sticking to that for the time being. Once more than 50% of the entries come in under the new names, I will reverse this and map any old Personna entries to the new name.

* The Δ vs columns show how an item has moved up or down the rankings since that month. = means no change in position, up or down arrows indicate how many positions up or down the rankings an item has moved compared to that month. n/a means the item was not present in that month.
