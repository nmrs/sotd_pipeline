## Search Strategies

### 1. Reddit Search Patterns
For each date, search using these patterns:
- `flair:SOTD [Date]`
- `SOTD Thread [Date]`
- `Shave of the Day [Date]`
- `Daily SOTD [Date]`
- `subreddit:wetshaving [Date] SOTD`

### 2. Wayback Machine
Search for archived Reddit pages:
- `https://web.archive.org/web/[DATE]*/https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/`
- `https://web.archive.org/web/[DATE]*/https://old.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/`

### 3. External Resources
- **Djudge Portal**: `site:djudge.com [Date] SOTD`
- **DamnFineShave**: `site:damnfineshave.com [Date] SOTD`
- **Google Site Search**: `site:reddit.com/r/Wetshaving [Date] SOTD`

## Validation Criteria
When found, validate threads against:
1. **Thread title relevance**: Must contain SOTD indicators
2. **Date accuracy**: Must match the missing date exactly
3. **Comment activity**: Should have reasonable engagement
4. **Content quality**: Should be legitimate SOTD threads

## Next Steps
1. **Manual Search**: Use the search patterns above for each date
2. **Document Findings**: Record any found threads with URLs
3. **Validate Results**: Ensure threads meet criteria
4. **Update Overrides**: Add valid threads to `thread_overrides.yaml`
5. **Update Plan**: Document external search results

## Expected Outcomes
- **Reduced scope**: 20 dates instead of 25 (20% reduction)
- **Focus on older dates**: 2016-2022 dates likely have genuinely missing threads
- **Archive importance**: Wayback Machine may be key for older dates
- **Community patterns**: Early dates (2016) may have different thread patterns
