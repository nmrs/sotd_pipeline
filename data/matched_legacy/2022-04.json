Picked up this new kamisori about a month ago after seeing /u/iamsms post about it and I think I've used it every day except for 2 days when I went back to DE. I've gotten a lot more comfortable with the kamisori but there are still some tough spots that probably will never be as easy as using a DE, notably around my jawline. The kamisori is a lot of fun but I don't think I'll ever get a shave as close as my most efficient DE shaves, and that's fine.\n\nLooking forward to picking up all my new gear and software waiting for me back home in a few weeks so we'll see if I stay on the Proraso Red train through April.",

Sea Spice Lime\n* **Aftershave:** Spearhead Shaving Company Seaforth! Sea Spice Lime\n* **Fragrance:** Spearhead Shaving Company Seaforth! Sea Spice Lime eau de toilette\n\nThis shave was supposed to be my Second Luxury ShaveTM for yesterday's Theme Thursday thread but time got away from me, so it became an anachronistic March Madness-themed April Fool's morning shave instead.\n\nChief EnGEMeer and head of Research and Development over at EldrormR Industries' GEM Division - u/EldrormR - was very generous to loan me his Zenith B 35 \"The Big One\", and looking at this girthy beast, I have to believe that this is what Bob Oppenheimer held in his hands when he said \"I am become Zeniva, the destroyer of soaps\". To get an idea of how big this thing is, check out the SOTD pic to see how it compares to what may or may not be a regular-sized basketball (meant to satisfy yesterday's Theme Thursday theme).\n\nThis brush is all backbone, achieved through density and with soft-tipped bristles. The knot doesn't bloom much, so face-lathering feels a bit like rolling a small massage ball over your face. Really a very pleasant feeling. The brush also lathered up the 20.1 base like a champ. I can see why papa Eld sings its praises!\n\nThe shave went great, and the blade that won't die is hanging in there, too. GEMtury shave, here I come!",

I definitely overloaded and had enough for a dozen passes in my brush, which wasn't a bad thing and I had a good lather going. The scent of the cream is nice but I always found it a bit mild. The splash is where the scent shines and packs just the right amount of kick.\n\nB13 is so nice. Love this brush.",

Such a nice scent overall. It has more of a sweet, woodsy note than other fougères. Perfect for the colder weather we've been getting.\n\nThe Karve provided a smooth shave again today. I have to say that I really feel the lift and cut of the hairs as it glides more than have with other razors. I was a little overconfident on the second pass and found a couple tiny weepers.\n\nRating: 3.5/5",

I think it was my technique that was off with this prototype razor.\n\nAlthough I didn't feel much during the shave, I was left with an irritated face. I thought green tea was an antioxidant?\nThe lather also caused some swelling around my mouth. Not sure but I might be allergic or something.\n\nThe EdP bridged it all together though. It stung going on, but now is quite fresh feeling and minty smelling.\n\n\nHappy Friday!",

PIF. I've been meaning to try some high quality cream and just haven't gotten around to it. I admit, this was better than I was expecting. I started with a well shaken out brush so I didn't overhydrate it out of the gate, and put a big old lump of this stuff right in the center and started face lathering. Should have used a smaller lump, got a ton of lather out of this thing. Took a bit of water to properly hydrate and I had lather everywhere. Shave quality was really good. The only thing I noticed that wasn't up to par with some of my soaps was the post shave feel. I almost always apply a balm, so this isn't really that big of a deal, but is the only real difference I noticed. Been thinking about picking up a tube of cream for traveling and now I know that it is a completely viable option. Thanks again!",

More water. Better shave. As I've come to do with these I over soaped on the first one and the lather got a bit too thick and heavy as I didn't have time to water it enough. This shave used less soap and about the same amount of water. Still not quite there on first pass but for the second it was slick and cushiony. I'm really enjoying this base. Clearly Obsessive is pretty obsessive about making a good soap... though they seem to go on hiatus a lot.\n\nI figured the scent out a bit more. Off the puck, it just really only hints at Old Spice but when you get it lathered and things calm down it is far, far closer. By the time you finish shaving the remnants of the scent are pretty Old Spicey. It's interesting how things fall off. After the last two more citrus-forward soaps this one just plays a bit different. We'll see how it mingles with the vintage after shave today but initially, it seems to be overpowered a bit by it. Playing better with the Original.\n\nThe Baxter was my first DE and something I come back to for a clean easy shave. It even performs well with the Derby blades!",

Today I did notice a couple tiny weepers on my neck after shaving. Just a couple red spots barely there, but they are there. So the razor and blade were not flawless, but since this wasn't part of yesterday's shave, I'm going to suppose that I just wasn't as careful with my technique.\n\nThe Semogue 2000 just does not feel as nice as my Omega. Compared to the Zenith... well, this one's a bit scratchier, which I'm not a fan of, but it splays much better, and my lather has better flowthrough with this brush, since it's not nearly as dense as the Zenith. So I think I prefer it to the Zenith. Although I did pick up a second Zenith to try, now... I've done a few lathers with it just to get the funk out before I start to use it on my face. Based on the specs, and a little bit on how the test lathers have gone, I might like this one better than the B33. But I suspect I still won't like it quite so much as my Omega. We'll see!",

A face lather too.\n\nI Just decided to try a short load face lather on a whim today. The goal is to just use a little soap, becaues you don't need all that much. It worked out pretty well.\n\nWith a low hum of septic tank pump guys going on in the bakcground,\n\n#### ䷀ Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Wolfman - Guerrilla Open Comb ::: Perma-Sharp Super ‹7 uses›)*\n\nVery nice and easy movement through the hairs. Great close cut, and very comfy\n\nRazor and Blade Performance/Comfort Rating: 4 out of 5 (Very Good)\n\n#### ䷀ Soap Notes\n*^(Stirling Mutton Tallow - Varen)*\n\nThem: An original scent by Stirling. \"This natural fougere is a powerful blend of oakmoss, lavender, coumarin, vetiver, sage, cedar, lichen, and geranium.\"\n\nI was told this was similar to Barrister and Mann Reserve Fern, which I think is a little too feminine for me, so I hesitated to buy this one. However, the performance of the mutton tallow base is just so sublime that I had to try it anyway.\n\nLather... 1. it doesn't take a lot of lather to do the job.\n2. a lather that is really wet can often perform well.\n\nSo, what if I didn't bother getting alather to maturity before getting it on the face?\n\nThis method avoids the problem of applying concentrate on your face, since so little soap is used at first. Shouldn't irritate the skin.\n\nHydration: Wet End of Perfect *(for me)*\n\n+ 15 sec load with a Lightly-Wet brush\n+ = 3 passes of lather\n\nBowl: No Bowl\n\n#### ䷀ Brush Notes\n*^(Semogue - Owner's Club Boar‹27 uses›)*\n\nWell, with this technique of a skimpy lather, it didn't do this new-ish brush any favors in the comfort dept. I'm sure it would be fine with an old, really broken-in boar, but that's just what happens with spur of the moment ideas. :-)\n\n----\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Very Close Shave\n*Neck*: Cut flush to where I just see the tips (above average for me)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm) *and also in the sub's sidebar.*\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

I'm officially SARS-CoV-2 positive, validated by yesterday's PCR test.\n\nBut it's the first day since it all started that I'm feeling a bit better, however my nose is still stuffed AF. Well, I decided to bring out the big guns: if this virus wants to ruin my sense of smell, I'll counter with my most pungent smelling shave soaps. Never thought I'd use VoA again, at least not before the Lather Games - but here we are. Drastic situations require drastic measures. I'm gonna assert my dominance over this MFin' virus.\n\nGiven that I own a few SW soaps now, I can lather the base well. Even VoA, which always was a tad dry during my Atlas Shaves, surprised me today with a very slick lather. Oh, and I definitely smelt it. Not as clear in all its stinky glory, but still enough. The aftershave still burns slightly on my skin.\n\nThe other surprise was the Personna blade. I seriously doubt anything has changed about them except the place where they are manufactured. Smooth on the first WTG pass, tugging and producing a few weepers on the neck when going ATG. The Parker 87R is in fact a very smooth operator too, but it needs a bit of a more aggressive blade for my facial hair. If I'd judge blades by how well they shave WTG, this would hands down be a top blade. But here, it isn't. Time to move on with the Parker - tomorrow, I'll try a Derby Premium in it.\n\nEnjoy your Friday and your weekend folks. Make the most of your time.",

Up today was Piacenza, Executive Man, and Campagnia. Testing the scents, I split them between each side of my face and my neck.\n\nIt's been awhile since I used Stirling and forgot how easy this stuff is to lather even with my hard water.\n\nI had a pack of those neat looking black Treet carbon blades I've been meaning to try, but when I threw them in my .84 Gamechanger they tugged like crazy on two days growth so I switched to the recently arrived SLOC head with a third use Wizamet or Polsilver (I forgot which it was?). I'd only used one OC razor before (Maggards), which was ok but I did manage to nick myself with it. The SLOC, however, is super easy to use and was extremely smooth with the Wizamet/Polsilver. No nicks and very little feedback with the alum.\n\ntl;dr Stirling easily produces a slick lather, even in my hard water, and the SLOC gives a smooth problem free shave when paired with a good blade.",

You can absolutely drown this base and it just gets slicker. Regarding the scent, Sea Spice Lime still isn't my jam, but this variant made for a refreshing, chilly shave. Synthetic cooling makes sense for most soaps these days, because the smell of menthol messes with the balance of some scents, but I think that sharp note would have worked well here. The cooling is perfect though; cool, not painfully freezing.",

Scent, base, ease of use and who could dislike the artwork? I kept throwing water at it just to see how much it would take and it just kept going with no sign of breaking down. I'll echo what I said yesterday about the vegan base and say that if you're just now seeing these soaps become available that you shouldn't be concerned whether it's good or not. Absolutely quality soap and you won't regret picking some up!",

I did some research and they don't seem to have a reputation for sharpness, but for whatever reason I get really close shaves with 2 passes. Finished it all off with some straight up classics.

Spearhead has one of the easiest to lather soap bases that I've used, SSL is a killer scent and the addition of synthetic cooling is a great addition for warmer spring days. House of Mammoth's Magic Splash is my absolute favorite post-shave splash and the cooling effect it has pairs nicely with SIL.\n\nThis is possibly my favorite WR1 that I've used. I'm usually someone who likes aggressive and efficient razors but this .61 gap is effective without feeling overly mild. This could easily be a razor that I used daily, that said I did have some tugging around my jawline that I didn't experience with higher gapped WR1 razors. I'm unsure if this is because of aluminum (I doubt it), the small gap (it's possible), or poor technique (very possible). I don't own a WR1 and I'm not as experienced with it as I am other razors and I feel like this razor requires some experience to get the best out of it. The only WR1 that I've used prior to this was a bronze WR1 DC .61SB/.74OC razor, I didn't experience any tugging with the bronze like I did the aluminum, so maybe the tugging was due to the material. That said, even with some minor tugging, I didn't have any irritation post-shave and I still got a very smooth shave with multiple passes. I'm going to need to use this one a few more times before I pass it on but it's definitely a very fun razor to use.",

I am pleased.\n\n*Laundry* is an amazing scent and an awesome soap. It was kind of a weird journey with it though, as it started out VERY soft, then got super dried out and hard, borderline triple milled it seemed. Example 1; a month or so after I got the soap I loaded from the tub with a badger brush and it looked like I loaded a quarter of the soap up. Example 2; this past week I was cutting some out and pressing it into a bowl, and far out, pressing it into place was a bit of a challenge at times as I had to really mash it into place it was that hard.\n\nAll-in-all, Grooming Dept's Donkey Milk Formula is awesome and I will gladly be using it more in the future.\n\nGoing to have another weekish of using whatever soap, then gonna commit to another one that's near death.\n\nHappy Saturday all.",

I doubted that it would be a great performer, but at this point, it's pure curiosity.\n\n#### ䷀ Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Wolfman - Guerrilla Open Comb ::: Gillette - Platinum ‹2 uses›)*\n\nWell, I got a very close shave. But the blade did generate a little tenderness. This OC head sure does change the way many of my favorite blades feel.\n\nThe Platinum rarely feels as \"touchy\" or \"extra slicy\" as this time. I did give myself a weeper, but it was because the potent razor/blade combo sheared off the top of a blemish.\n\nRazor and Blade Performance/Comfort Rating: 2 out of 5 (Okay)\n\n#### ䷀ Soap Notes\n*^(Pinaud - Clubman)*\n\nScent: Seems like it has none.\n\nLather... The lather was okay and serviceable. But poor secondary slickness, and a bit of an airy feel, similar to some medium-quality vegan soaps I've encountered.\n\nPerformance-wise, Proraso may edge it out by a little. Definitely near the bottom of the ladder compared to most other soaps I've used.\n\nBut since we have so few options of soap we can walk into a local store and buy in person, at least it works. It gave nice face feel and decent enough razor glide.\n\nHydration: A Little Too Dry *(for me)*\n\n+ 0.25 tsp soap with a Lightly-Wet brush\n+ 4.5 tsp added to build the lather\n+ = 6 passes of lather\n\nBowl: [Roger Quintero 3D Printed Bowl](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3392930)\nI use the XL version of this bowl.\n\n#### ䷀ Brush Notes\n*^(Declaration Grooming - B13 Dogwood/Briar Hybrid 28mm‹10 uses›)*\n\nBig, soft, and easy as always. Perfect.\n\n----\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Cut flush to where I just see the tips (above average for me)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm) *and also in the sub's sidebar.*\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

Vespers is an odd one to my nose. I enjoy it enough I am going to kill the sample but not enough to go hunt down a tub. Have a great weekend :)\n\n--\n\n* ⚔️ Fight 125, Round 3: Astra - Superior Stainless (1.0, Russia 🇷🇺) vs. Polsilver - Super Iridium (1.0, Russia 🇷🇺)\n\nDon't know if it was a quirk of the lather or blade coating, but the Polsilver never regained the spotless performance of R1. Nonetheless, whatever was going on yesterday corrected itself. These were, again, close with very similar glide. Neither were perfect on the feedback but the Polsilver cleanly ahead, and it mopped up on the throat shave. The Astra Stainless is a fine blade but not quite up to the Polsilver in the aggregate.\n\nWinner of Round 3 and Fight 125: Polsilver - Super Iridium.",

I lost my sense of taste and smell, almost completely. Maybe about 5% left, but it needs to be something really potent.\n\nDespite this, I wanted to give my Extró another go after today's discussion in the DQ thread. Maybe a bit of a blessing, as I could solely focus on the base. Also, my GEM blades finally arrived so I could give the beautiful MMOC from u/djundjila a spin. Here we go:\n\nThis base of Extró is definitely not big on slickness. Stirling gets that handled better. Where it shines is protection/cushion and skin feel. I used a razor with a rather aggressive notion today, but still didn't get as many weepers as I feared I would. Also, after rinsing it off, my skin felt soft and refreshed. It's good, but definitely no Sego, Kaizen, Milksteak or Tusk. But a good vegan soft soap.\n\nThe MMOC was great to use. I shaved both my head and my face btw, the former with a single WTG pass and the latter with two passes. At first I was a bit scared of using it directly on my head, but that fear vanished quickly as I saw how efficient it knocked down the stubble. Due to the open comb, I could get really close to my moustache for shaping and styling - a definite bonus point IMO. Also, even on the ATG part of the neck where it felt a bit harsh and I expected bleeding, not much damage was done. All the weepers I had today were micro, literally very tiny spots. Ok, except one: I had a pimple on the back of my neck and since I paid a bit too less attention, the MMOC cut it clean off. I could feel a minor sting and even see a bit of blood on the lather at the razor - bit since it's a open comb, it rinsed off clear and went back to business. What a great razor! Much thanks to u/djundjila for this awesome gift!!! 🤝🏻\n\nLastly, despite smelling nothing much, I still enjoy mentholated software as Covid doesn't interfere with my temperature feeling. Both the splash with it's burn as well as the Orange Chill were really great on my skin.",

Sea Spice Lime\n- **Aftershave**: Spearhead Shaving Company Seaforth! Sea Spice Lime\n\nLast continental shave before I visit her majesty's land of Prince Andrew and spotted dick. The next few shaves will be sample size everything, so I paid extra attention to enjoy loading the Zenith beast from a full size tub. Sea Spice Lime is so nice, even if it snowed again here yesterday. Also, this tub is the closest to getting killed, so I'm going to prioritise it while I have the Zeniva, the Destroyer Of Soaps on loan.",

The GSB is not my favorite blade, blade feel and feedback have consistently been higher than my ideal, but they are still very good in the Henson. The GSB had a no-fault performance today that cleanly beat the Super-Max for glide and feedback. The GSB was also ever so slightly more consistent for closeness. The Super-Max did, though, have the superior throat shave. Super-Max was a solid blade but the GSB was better.\n\nWinner of Round 1: Gillette - Silver Blue.",

B3 isn't regarded as sexy or refined, but neither am I. It makes for a good match.\n\nThis razor is my most used razor. Another member of this community wants to try it to see if he can figure out why I like the thing so much. I prefer using straight razors, but the maintenance and stropping that goes with them gets old for me. This razor eliminates the maintenance, but still allows for a full range of angles just like a straight razor does. Even more so than the Feather AC type razors. It's just a gnarly naked blade on a stick.",

Got dressed, had a bite to eat, and drove over to Epcot for the Tower of Terror 10-Miler. My corral got started just as the first finishes were crossing the finish line (at about 54 minutes after the first start). I was hoping to manage a shade faster than 15 minutes/mile. I ended up finishing in 2:19:57 for an official pace of 14 minutes/mile. I had a great time and I'm currently feeling very accomplished.\n\nCame home, took a hot shower, and broke out the Gravefruit to celebrate a successful run.

Will use the synbad on Monday and confirm the yaqi knot is the culprit and that I'm not just used to the softness of the cashmere.",

Still a bit scratchy, still does not splay well. But it made a good lather today, and maybe has stopped eating so much lather.\n\nThe short comb NEW gave me a pretty good shave today, but I still do not like how this feels quite as much as a Tech. It probably would help if I used this more often, and felt like I had better technique with this razor. I think it does needs to be handled slightly differently than a Tech, and differently than the long comb NEW. It feels like it is its own beast, not like the others made before and after.\n\nFiga complements my splash and balm rather well today. Or perhaps I should put that the other way around, since the perfume dominates the other scents.",

SWs base (does anyone know if it has a name btw?) has again shown me why they're my favourite vegan soap base: creamy lather, still slick and a very good post shave skin feel.\n\nThe MMOC was yet again a bit rough on my head, but without any serious issues. I was carefully following the advice by u/djundjila to keep it flat on my skin and use little pressure. However, this is a bit counterintuitive on headshaves where you need to follow a lot of curves/angles. I seriously like the milder Star 1912 a bit more for shaving my head. On some parts I needed some touch-ups, a problem I usually face with open comb razors on my head. The MMOC likes going XTG on the back of my head though, something I can rarely do with other razors as they'll either tug or cut. On my face, it shines. There's some mild discomfort on the ATG pass on the neck, but to be expected with a relatively new GEM PTFE blade. Everything else is just such fun. You keep it flat and it keeps you well groomed. Due to the sharpness, it has no problem to go directly to the corners of my mouth, directly under the stache to trim those scratchy unwanted hairs away. I consider this an absolute win!\n\nAfter facing a grim return of frosty temperatures and snow in Germany, today the sun came out with strength and I basked in its glory on my balcony for a while. My recovery from Covid is slow, but at least steady. I can already breathe a bit easier today.",

I have been using a shave brush for almost a year, maybe 2. It was a father's day present. The shave brush really improved the quality of my shave.\n\nI've been going quite a few days in between shaves, my facial hair grows very fast. I'm also a head shaver. I got sick of my 3-4 day growth clogging up my cartridge razors, so I started looking for an alternative.\n\nAfter some research, I settled on the Meiji. I wanted something adjustable, on the fly.\n\nI will say, that for a first time shave, it went pretty well. I only went with and across the grain. Was about to go against the grain but saw some small blood spots soaking thru the shave cream on my neck, so I called it quits.\n\nI only shaved my face. I'm going to get some more experience with that before I get bold enough to shave my head.\n\nOh, and I played it very safe. I left the Meiji on level 1, which is the most mild shave.",

There was a world of difference in the shave I got. Mainly because of the razor. I switched from a dull straight razor to the Feather popular tto. Winter is finally coming to a close in the mountains of Colorado. Maybe a few more snowstorms with some rain in between them then we'll be out finally.",

My local theatre company does a \"Chopped\" style fundraiser every year and tonight was the night to cook up some craziness. Three ingredients: Corn Meal, Grapefruit, & Cotton Candy. They all had to present in the dish. I've peeled, candied, juiced, and probably crossed several lines with a number of grapefruits this week trying to develop a recipe.\n\nOne amazon purchase of a cotton candy machine and several hours of experimenting with weird grapefruit shit later and I came up with zesty fried chicken with maple cotton candy, johnnycakes, and a watermelon fennel slaw.\n\nGotta say... it came out really really well. Grapefruit zest in the marinade and breading of the chicken. A grapefruit juice and champagne vinegar vinaigrette for the slaw.\n\nNow I've got a fridge full of grapefruit zest, several (mostly gross) candied grapefruit peels, and a freshly shaved, magically scented face.\n\nSingle pass, reasonably smooth shave considering the amount of cooking that went on today. SW's excellent base is luckily on auto-pilot for me.",

First time on a vintage razor went pretty well, tho it might have gone better with a new blade. Had some roughness. Also first time with the YRP (when I smelled the soap sample last week, I knew I needed it) and it's great. Probably gonna get the EDT once I can afford, because much like Labyrinth and Leviathan, this is a smell I want on me all the time!",

In honour of Queen Lizzie, whose college I'm staying at, I'm planning to use at least one British shave item every day. Luckily I do own a British brush, or this would have been difficult during the mandatory MicroMatic Mammoth Monday Formation Flight (I guess I would have bought a British aftershave for the occasion). It took me a moment to formulate a procedure to deal with [this situation](https://imgur.com/0A84Q9L.jpeg), but after a bit of improvise, adapt, overcome, I figured out how to shave like my forebears and got a nice shave in.\n\n*Tobacconist* (new to me) turned out to be a very pleasant tobacco scent, and as I suspected, *Gratiot League Square* was a fitting follow-up scent. Now off to the complimentary full English breakfast. Yum!",

Blade started ever so slightly tugging here and there - potentially could get another use out of it, but for most blades it is 3 and out - or in case of willy's that I used recently - 1 and out!\n\nNo errors, no stinging, and good DFS.

I was wanting to throw a 7 o'clock yellow into my Tatara with the Nodachi plate. Thing was, since I didn't prepare my gear the night before, I'd need to do it first thing. That changed when at 1:30am, I get woken by the sound of breaking glass!\n\nJumped out of bed faster than when you hear that dog spewing sound...\n\nI'm fucking dopey as fuck at this hour and not really knowing where the sound came from, I head to the living room. There it is, the fucking clock had fallen off the wall! Glass everywhere. Fuck me dead. Not what I needed.\n\nSpend the next 90 mins sweeping up glass, vacuuming the floor, re vacuuming the floors. I hate broken glass so much. And don't want my dogs getting it stuck in their paws.\n\nSo my shave was the same shit I'd used a few days before. It was fine. In fact the face feels super smooth, but it's often the case when waiting an extra day.",

Damn, that scent is sublime and I wonder why the hell I never took a leap for it earlier. Mixed it with some Lucky Tiger to cut it a bit and boy do I smell good.

No nicks/irritation. Trying out the Krona/Gillette Platinum combo to see how the razor with my favorite blade could work together. It worked, as it was smooth and efficient. The cream also did its dirty work by providing slickness, protection, cushion and glide that all worked fantastically to help make this shave great. Overall, great shave to start this week. Next shave will be an early birthday shave with great products to use on that special shave, so stay tuned.",

The Winning Razor is exactly that type for me, along with the Henson AL13 and SCS-Model A. The latter are both lightweight aluminum and I wanted something heavier. Moon Soaps Havana is excellent, both in performance and fragrance. It's a standout for me, one that I keep wanting to use in spite of all the other options I have.\n\nSomething interesting to me is the fact that I got a great shave from an Astra Superior Stainless blade. I have never gotten a good one from a Superior Platinum. I'm guessing that the stainless are sharper? Whatever it is, I'm glad to know it's an option.\n\nThis was essentially a perfect shave. I ended up with an irritation-free BBS result. 10/10. Happy shaves all!",

I really enjoy this brush - the quality of the knot is great. It actually pretty similar to the Varlet brush I used yesterday. However, I think this one will break in a bit more.\n\nOverall, great shave. I love using this CFG Ti.\n\nHave a great Monday all!",

It hit me that when they took the mild solid bar of the Guerilla and made it open comb, for me it was more than just a small aggression/efficiency jump. It was a jump across almost the whole spectrum. It's not as bad as the Dart for me, but it is at the aggressive point where I need to watch my blade choice carefully.\n\nI stopped after 2.5 passes and had a super close shave with good comfort.\n\nRazor and Blade Performance/Comfort Rating: 3 out of 5 (Good)\n\n#### ䷀ Soap Notes\n*^(Abbate Y La Mantia - Garibaldi)*\n\nThem: \"marine notes; everything brought to sublimation by a spicy note of savory Kentucky tobacco.\"\n\n\"just salt in the wood, tobacco on the tongue and the scent of tropical fruit and nuts that comes from the hold.\"\n\nMe: My first time with this soap was a blind scent approach, and I was able to pick up some light woodiness, the tropical fruit, and maybe the marine notes were there and I was getting them as a pleasant unisex floral.\n\nI didn't get any tobacco though. It just came across as that light woodiness, I suppose.\n\nBut, though light, I did enjoy it and could use it every day, scent-wise.\n\nLather... This resembled a medium quality vegan soap, where the lather was a watery kind of slickness. It got the job done pretty well, but there was no creaminess like I prefer.\n\nMaybe this soap base is suited for folks who like a dryer lather, and or face latherers, who naturally prefer that.\n\nHydration: Perfect *(for me)*\n\n+ 0.25 tsp soap with a Lightly-Wet brush\n+ 2.6 tsp added to build the lather\n+ = 5 passes of lather\n\nBowl: [Roger Quintero 3D Printed Bowl](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3392930)\nI use the XL version of this bowl.\n\n#### ䷀ Brush Notes\n*^(Zenith - Horse Extra Soft - 507N XS‹9 uses›)*\n\nVery comfy with just a little prickle. A more creamy lather may have hidden that amount of prickle a bit better.\n\n----\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Cut flush to where I just see the tips (above average for me)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm) *and also in the sub's sidebar.*\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

The scent might not fit this time of year, but have been cycling through the Mammoth scents I have and I couldn't resist this one regardless.\n\nHope everyone has had a wonderful Monday!",

Going in to this completely arbitrary milestone, I thought I'd kill this tub of Castle Forbes Lime. First kill of the year. This tub is special, in another completely arbitrary manner, because it's the first decent soap I picked up. For almost 3 years of straight razor shaving I completely underestimated the value of a good soap set and brush. I had a very utilitarian approach. Post shave issues, like irritation, I blamed completely on my technique. Either in the shaving technique itself or the maintenance of my blade. This wasn't without it's up's, however, because it made dig deeper and deeper into the rabbit hole. I was just bent on recreating the close and gentle shave I'd gotten from a random barber, who also just so happened to terribly mess up one of my mustache lines. Towards the end of a tub, I went to r/wicked_edge and asked for similar scent recommendations, and in short was told I was using hot trash (which I most certainly was). I got some recommendations and just picked the most expensive one. My mind was pretty blown and further down the rabbit hole I went. I would not buy another tub, both for price and performance, but I definitely got a lot out of it. Oh, and when I first started straight razor shaving, never thought I'd own a Thiers Issard. No nicks, a little bit of irritation, a close and very pleasant shave.",

The trees are starting to bud and the grass is getting greener so I've been looking forward to pulling out more warm weather scents. I've never really used them back to back but yesterday I used my timeless slim and today I used the .68 Ti with the same blade. The .68 feels much smoother with less blade feel than the slim. I looked it up on the site and the slim is (+) blade exposure and the .68 is neutral. So just another example that blade gap doesn't tell the whole story of how a razor shaves. I've been a fan of the the Astra greens but the blues are under appreciated. It's hard to say if they're sharper but they do feel like they're smoother. I'll have to use both back to back in the future to see what I like more.",

I like it way better than the boar I had been using. Lather with it was effortless.\n\nAs to the Astra SP. Still testing these as part of a 20 blade sampler. These are really good, so far they're top of the heap, but they're also the first blade tested. They definitely beat out both incumbents, though.

Cella is the classic almond-scented shave cream that before today I had yet to try. It produced a wonderful lather. These old school formulas like Cella and Tabac are mainstays for a reason.\n\nI was in a rush again this morning, and I had to go with another single-pass shave (with touchups). The Karve still produced good results.\n\nI was going to use the Almond Leather AS again today. Then u/NewWallabees mentioned 1904 in the DQ thread yesterday, I had that scent stuck in my head, and I had to use it this morning. It's a great scent with an incredible dry down. The coffee note isn't as prominent like with a gourmand coffee scent, but it's there.\n\nRating: 4/5",

Seriously as much as the new shiny razors look awesome and quality is great, the oldies don't shave any worse (well in some cases that is), and can give a nice surprise too!\n\nSame software setup as yesterday because why not - nice and refreshing.\n\nDecided to give another outing to T-rex sample that I have.... I do love the zoologist lineup but samples are so hard to get on this side of the pond - there's place in london that does them for ridiculous prices (1ml for £5). When on trip to London in January - I've tried a few there that I really liked (civet, nightingale snowy owl, camel) and grabbed sample of couple (trex, bee)... Their new releases sound awesome too!",

The 27mm knot set to 56mm loft had softer tips than I expected, but not by much. The brush has more backbone than my Scrubby (28mm x 50mm) and about the same feel as my Beast (31mm x 57mm). It'll soften up with use, so I am excited to see where this knot goes in a few months.\n\nTo start the break in process I only did a single test hand lather yesterday to help defunk the brush and then let it dry. Today's use dove right into face lathering.\n\nWith both today's shave and yesterday's test lather I used Tabac. In both instances the \"new boar\" stink overpowered the Stank and unbleached stink is more potent than bleached stink. Today was slightly better until I splayed the knot a bit to get more lather built. Once that happened, I was gifted eye wateringly powerful stink from the core of the knot for a few seconds. I know the smell will fade with use, so I'll avoid delicate scents for a few more shaves just to help mask any residual stink.\n\nThe MM24 provided an effortless 3 pass BBS shave.",

Blue & Clear 26mm Synthetic\n* **Razor:** Aylsworth Drakkant prototype\n* **Blade:** Gillette Silver Blue (4)\n* **Lather:** [Mäurer & Wirtz - Tabac - Soap](https://trythatsoap.com/collection/1165/?product_type=soap)\n\n* **Post Shave:** [Barrister and Mann - Ravish - Aftershave](https://trythatsoap.com/collection/1815/?product_type=aftershave)\n\n\n\n\nAnother great head shave this morning. Granted I did not have many days growth but honestly all I needed was a 1 pass shave with touch ups for an amazingly smooth shave. Aside from the top cap which I would prefer smooth and not beveled, I am loving this razor. For a couple more days, at least.\n\nWhipping up a bowl full of lather and slathering it all over my head really made me feel like I was shaving at Grandma's house or something to that effect. Tabac is slicker than my Grandma ever was, that's for sure. Even with her 5 year streak in Vegas...\n\nHave a great Tuesday!",

Gillette (1)\n* **Lather:** Soap Commander - *Memories* \\- Soap\n* **Post Shave:** [Zingari - Unscented - Balm](https://trythatsoap.com/collection/1462/?product_type=balm2)\n* **Post Shave:** Soap Commander - *Memories* \\- Aftershave\n* **Fragrance:** [House of Mammoth - *Embrace* \\- Eau de Parfum](https://trythatsoap.com/collection/2457/?product_type=eaudeparfum)\n\nCrack thrill is alive and well apparently. I hadn't used Soap Commander in a number of years. I remember it being an okay soap. Somehow I found out they were having a 50% off sale of last year's seasonal scents and it piqued my interest. I figured you can't go wrong at around $22 for a brand new set (and the soap is 6 oz!). So it came in yesterday and it smells pretty damn good. Memories is their Winter scent and it nails the holiday vibe perfectly for me. More so than any other Christmas type scent I've experienced. You wouldn't really expect that with published notes of saffron, cedar, and red tea, but it does. I also get some baking spice vibes from it like cinnamon, a hint of clove maybe, and nutmeg. The scent once lathered was a bit subdued and I didn't experience any burning so that was good. Performance was better than I expected. The soap is easy to lather and doesn't really take a lot of water, but still ended up very creamy and slick. Nice stuff. The aftershave is a pretty standard formula as far as artisan aftershaves go. Nothing earth shattering to report there, but it's good and the scent is very nice. HoM Embrace makes a great pairing with it too. I just wish this scent would last longer on my skin.\n\nAnother first (and very surprising finding) was my first use of a King C. Gillette blade. Paired with the Muhle ROCCA, this was one of the smoothest shaves I've ever had, no joke. Like jaw-droppingly smooth. I need to try it my other razors to see how they perform, but it makes me want to go to Walgreens and clean them out lol. Unfortunately they are expensive though (for DE blades) at $5.99 for 10. I did read some speculation on forums that they are just rebranded Gillette Platinums or Silver Blues, but I have used both of those in my ROCCA before and they were not this smooth and efficient. Hmmm. I will have to do some more experimentation to prove or disprove this theory and relay my findings. They are made in Russia, most likely at the same factory, but I don't think these are simply rebranded.",

Smooth and very efficient.\n\nRazor and Blade Performance/Comfort Rating: 4 out of 5 (Very Good)\n\n#### ䷀ Soap Notes\n*^(Mystic Water Soap - Marrakesh)*\n\nScent: I liked the warmth and woody-ambery spice. It was enough, but not too much. I liked that it had some strength. It may have started out too much, but sitting around for a couple of years I'm sure has mellowed it out, and with this one that's good for me.\n\nScent Strength: 5/10, present during shaving.\n\nLather... Not as good as I remember, but still quite good, and maybe a little better than what I've seen others do with it. It does seem to do a little better with more mix time than average.\n\nHydration: Perfect *(for me)*\n\n+ 45 sec load with a Lightly-Wet brush\n+ 3.4 tsp added to build the lather\n+ = 6 passes of lather\n\nBowl: [Roger Quintero 3D Printed Bowl](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3392930)\nI use the XL version of this bowl.\n\n#### ䷀ Brush Notes\n*^(Declaration Grooming - B13 Dogwood/Briar Hybrid 28mm‹11 uses›)*\n\nAmazing as usual... big, soft, and easy to splay.\n\n----\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Cut flush to where I just see the tips (above average for me)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm) *and also in the sub's sidebar.*\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

It has a fairly long list of scent notes, and while my unsophisticated nose is unable to pick up post of them, I do find the combination intoxicating.

Not overpoweringly sweet, just the right amount of sweet. They hit the \"sweet spot\".",

Very different scents, but I like the combo. A little vetiver balm rounds it out nicely. Today's perfume overwhelms the shave combo, of course. It doesn't really layer well on it, but is a good scent in its own right.\n\nDuring the first two passes, one side of the razor had more blade feel than the other, which is the first time I've noticed that from this razor. The blade wasn't obviously misaligned, and I didn't notice it in the third pass, either. Not sure if this will persist, or some weird temporary effect.",

      "body": "**Tabac Tuesday, now with more MMOC**\n\n* Prep: Face wash w/ Balea Sensitive cleaning foam\n* Brush: AP Shave Co. Purple Haze w/ 26 mm 2BED fan\n* Razor: GEM Micromatic Open Comb single edge razor\n* Blade: Personna GEM PTFE\n* Lather: Mäurer & Wirtz - Tabac Original Rasierseife, stick\n* Post Shave: Speick Men Aftershave + TFS Witch Hazel\n* Post Shave 2: Stirling Soap Co. - Orange Chill ASB + antiseptic cream\n\nYou know what's a good part of losing your scent? You can finally judge soap bases without being distracted. This Tabac soap stick is kind of a never-ending story: bought it 2019/20, still looks barely like anything has been used up. Only today I had to peel the gold layer back a bit to get more soap on my stubble.\n\nBasically this is a shave to make u/djundjila happy, he gifted me this awesome MMOC and loves Tabac. I can see why though: it's a solid performer, whips up a good lather. Without my smell, I personally can enjoy it a bit more. I only get a very faint note off the stick.\n\nThe MMOC was so keen on shaving and worked so well with the Tabac that I actually did three full passes instead of my usual two. Unfortunately, since I almost never go ATG on my cheeks, they weren't used to the harsh feeling of the MMOC doing just that in brutal efficiency. Two nests of weepers formed on each side of my face. That was the point where I said: ok Dave, don't push your luck. I finished my chin with another XTG pass in the other direction to minimize bleeding. Thankfully that worked.\n\nI had to be creative with the Post Shave options: since the Speick is almost empty, I added a few more drops of witch hazel to stop the bleeding. And I combined the soothing menthol kick of Orange Chill with my antiseptic cream. There's still a tiny bit of irritation present, but aside from those two areas this was one of my greatest shaves ever.\n\nTomorrow I'm planning a special shave with both of my GEM razors. Stay tuned!",

My only real complaint was that it didn't feel very close, so for today's shave with the derby, I decided to see just how much it would take to get BBS.\n\nAfter all, if it's going to have any chance at being my favorite, it should be possible to get super smooth. More passes is fine as long as irritation is still minimal.\n\nNeedless to say, it took more effort than I want my favorite to take. I was applying a decent amount of pressure on the ATG passes and I had a lot of passes. I got BBS on most of it, but there's still a smidgen of stubble along the chin that wouldn't go away.\n\nThat being considered, I suppose one plus is that it's pretty forgiving. The balm was needed, but no cuts and not too much irritation.",

I used a VERY light touch with the SE today, it did a little better.\n\nI'm a little pissed today. The IRS adjusted my tax stuff and my refund was more than cut in half. I'm waiting to hear why as they have no data available to me right now. It also ticks me off that I have to pay Federal income taxes when not living in the country anyway...but that's probably a conversation for a different sub-reddit.\n\nHave a great day folks!",

Heather splash\n\nI felt some extra pressure to be careful with my shave, because later today I'll be meeting with u/Semaj3000, my fellow fellow of the Fellowship of MMOC Djudges, and I can't well show up to the first international djudicial meeting with a nicked face, can I now? 😄\n\nIn today's British travel shave we have not one but two British products - a British Flat Bottom Tech (gifted to me by the very generous u/VisceralWatch) and Mr Natty's \"Great Britain's Finest\" shave soap. First of all, \"Great Britain's Finest\" my arse. Mr Natty's soap was just a frothy dry mess for me that wouldn't take water. Even D. R. Harris creams perform better for me. Maybe I'm just not used to this soap and others have had better results, but I'm not even interested in giving this soap a second chance at this point.\n\nI got three careful passes in nonetheless, and got a slow BBS shave. The Flat Bottom Tech with a fresh Feather blade is really a very balanced razor and appears to have been the right choice given today's sub par lather.\n\nNo fragrance today because I woke up with a raging hangover and couldn't decide on a scent.\n\nOn a side note, I had dinner in Keble College yesterday evening, and it was a fun and puzzling experience. This place looks like [fancy Hogwarts](https://i.imgur.com/QGyFM9p.jpeg) and the fancy food and wooden benches are like a combination of a French restaurant and a German beer tent. Good times!\n\nNow off to the complimentary full English breakfast. Yum!",

I have a lot to learn, did two WTG passes then switched over to my Rockwell for a third WTG for cleanup. Neck was feeling it already on the second pass. It was staggering to switch mid shave to the Rockwell and to experience how mild the 6s was compared to what I'm told is one of the milder GEM razors. Busted out the alum block and this is one of my few splashes that has menthol in it and that was much needed today, really refreshing after a less than ideal shave. I really get the vanilla in this scent.",

Elements of three of General Buell's five divisions were at Pittsburgh Landing by dawn April 7, and the placement of those Army of the Ohio brigades on the left allowed Grant to squeeze his army's line even more-much as he had done on the right once Lew Wallace's division had arrived the previous evening. The arrival of these fresh troops was fortunate because the Army of the Tennessee was in shambles, particularly Generals Benjamin Prentiss' and W.H.L. Wallace's divisions. Many of the men were gun-shy, with Lt. George Nispel writing that his cannoneers in Battery E of the 2nd Illinois Light Artillery had hastily built a small parapet of dirt in front of their position, \"thinking the enemy during the darkness...might make an attempt to charge and capture our guns.\" The night was long and miserable for all involved. Grant's army had lost the majority of four of five division camps. Lew Wallace's troops had none of their tents or equipment, and Buell's forces likewise had left theirs down the river at Savannah, Tenn. Upon informing Colonel John A. Davis of the 46th Illinois that his men had no food, a captain was told to tell his men to \"sit down and suck your thumbs.\" One fortunate Illinoisan in Brig. Gen. Stephen Hurlbut's 4th Division noted, \"We were furnished with some crackers and raw meat which was eaten without cooking, as we dare not make a fire.\"\n\nGrant could attest to his men's misery. His army had been pounded that day, and he had seen horrors that had almost made him sick-vastly overshadowing anything he had seen during the Mexican War or even earlier in this war. Not the least sickening was the abrupt death of one of his scouts, Capt. Irving Carson, who was decapitated by a Confederate cannonball while standing right next to Grant. A \"six pound ball struck an oak tree close by and glancing took off the head of General Grant's adecamp [sic] Capt. Carson,\" recalled a witness, an Indiana soldier. \"And passing through our comp[any] ranks took off the legs of poor George White.\" Though covered with blood and brains, and bothered by a throbbing ankle, Grant continued traveling his line that evening, joined by Buell. \"Boys, remember the watchword is Donaldson [Donelson],\" he encouraged his men, misquoted later by an anonymous observer. Other misadventures had occurred that day for Grant, who, according to one of his escorts, \"continuously rode along the line of battle, through the hottest of their fire, for the whole distance of about five miles.\" Grant was nearly wounded when canister struck and bent his sword scabbard-an event Grant later claimed took place on the battle's second day but most historians believe actually occurred on the first. Who knows what it would have done to his leg if the canister had struck an inch or two in either direction? Grant had continually moved reinforcements to the front and established a final line of defense the first day, but that was about it.\n\nAs Hurlbut later wrote, \"It was...a series of independent conflicts, on our side, controlled, as best they might be, by the division or detachment upon which the attack fell, but with no unity of movement nor possibility of combined action, extending over the whole, or any considerable part of the field.\" Buell in turn found fault for \"the want of cohesion and concert in the Union ranks\" and \"the absence of a common head.\" \"It was little more than a fearful melee at best,\" recalled one veteran, but it worked. Colonel William T. Shaw of the 14th Iowa tried to explain the phenomenon: \"They outgeneraled us, but we outcolonelled them.\"\n\nStill, it was that lower-level grit that put Grant in a position to come out on top. His decision to trade space for time as the battle unfolded had succeeded. Grant, remembered 5th Division commander Maj. Gen. William Sherman, was using methods adopted during his victory at Fort Donelson back in February. \"[A]t a certain period of the [Fort Donelson] battle,\" Sherman recalled, \"he saw that either side was ready to give way if the other showed a bold front, and he was determined to do that very thing\" again at Shiloh. Grant was convinced that his army's losses would be offset once Lew Wallace's division arrived on the battlefield from their camps north of Pittsburg Landing, even if Buell was still absent. He later claimed, perhaps incorrectly, that \"victory was assured when Wallace arrived.\" It all could be thrown away, however, and fairly easily. History is replete with examples of military commanders who retreated when they did not have to after a disastrous, but not fatal, day of fighting. As with George McClellan on the Virginia Peninsula or Joseph Hooker at Chancellorsville, both of whom still possessed vast advantages in terms of numbers of troops, a lesser commander than Grant could have retreated during the night. Doing so would no doubt have given the Confederates a major victory much like they enjoyed at Chancellorsville in May 1863 and have blunted enthusiasm for the continual Union advance toward the important railroad town of Corinth, Miss., also buying time for Rebel Maj. Gen. Earl Van Dorn to arrive with new troops. Moreover, it must be noted that the idea was actually on many minds that night. John Rawlins later indicated that Buell came to Grant while he was at the landing and asked what preparations he had made for withdrawing. \"I have not yet despaired of whipping them, general,\" Grant replied. Although Buell later denied it, the mentality fits each of the actors. More believable were the accounts of Grant's own officers. \"Shall I make preparations for a retreat?\" Lt. Col. James McPherson asked Grant. \"Retreat? No!\" Grant responded, \"I propose to attack at daylight, and whip them.\"\n\nAmid the chaos, as he suddenly had some calm moments to sit a think, Grant began to look for a place to make his headquarters. He first gathered himself beneath a large oak tree just atop the high ground at the landing. With the rain coming in, he decided after midnight to walk over to the small cabin he had used earlier. By this time, any structure was being used as a hospital for the wounded, and a weak-stomached Grant could take no more than a few seconds amid the terror and screams of the wounded in the cabin. Despite his swollen and aching ankle and the torrents of precipitation, he decided to return to what he called his \"tree in the rain.\" It was there that Grant, collar pulled up and hat close down on his face, made some of the most significant decisions of the war. In particular, Sherman was man enough to admit he was thinking in terms of retreat. He came to Grant under his tree in the rain with the idea of broaching the subject, as \"the only thing just then possible, as it seemed to me, was to put the river between us and the enemy and recuperate.\" At the last minute he became embarrassed and blurted out, \"Well, Grant, we've had the devil's own day, haven't we?\" A determined Grant, his mind already made up, responded, \"Yes, lick 'em to-morrow, though.\" And lick 'em they did....",

I'm excited to use it in the games.\n\nIt lathered up nicely and produced a relatively slick covering on my face. I can't get over the smell though- to my nose, it straight up smells like cannabis oil. Not a bad smell necessarily, but not at all what I was expecting. Maybe it gave me a very expensive idea for Wildcard Wednesday?\n\nAfter some beautiful shaves with the Astra SP, I decided to compare it back to back with what was previously my go-to, the Derby Extra. I made one swipe and noped out of the Derby. The ASP was just that much better. The Derbys will be going into a box to PIF to someone else.\n\nNext on my list to try is the Astra SS. I didn't love how raw my face was afterward, but I don't know if that was the blade or the pot lather. I suspect the blade, because it felt like it tugged some, but I'll try it again tomorrow with some more tried-and-true soap.",

It looks like every three is around where I need to reset my nose and give it break from Old Spice soaps. Eventually everything starts smelling like Old Spice which... wait, that sounds awesome. :D\n\nI decided to go back to this little soap I found at a store in upstate NY. I had fantastic shaves with it and thought I was crazy so even PIFd it so someone else could back me up. They had an OK experience with it. Now that I've tried more bases and soaps I figured time to give it another go. It's not as good as I remembered but it's still pretty strong. The lather is woeful, honestly, which I've always said but the shave is slick and close and nothing leaves my face feeling as soft as this does. I even used my boar brush this time and it just feels so soft. I don't think this is the best ever anymore (that's going to OSP) at the time but I still really like it. Now to convince them to make an Old Spice dupe.",

Thankfully, Necromantic is scented strongly enough that I get at least a faint note from the soap and corresponding splash/toner. BTW, *wicked* is not only meant for pure evil, but is also a synonym for *damn cool*.\n\nThe Star was used for my head shave, two passes here. The MMOC was the \"one pass and done\" face shaver. Both of these handled their territory well - I got one of the greatest dome shaves ever with the nimble Star, while the face shave with the MMOC was almost unbloody (sadly, two of yesterday's weepers were reopened). I got really confident with them and now I enjoy both of these GEM razors dearly! Really looking forward to the GEMsOfWisdom side-side challenge in August.\n\nHere's a bonus song to get y'all through this hump day: [Siouxsie and the Banshees - The Passenger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nAON-MwUPY).

First time using an aftershave, let alone a full set. Interested to experiment more. Nicked myself once but otherwise pretty good.",

Fit and finish are outstanding, and I'm very pleased with the razor. I can't get over how smooth it is for such a big blade gap. First shave yesterday was so so but I think the blade I was using was past prime. Today with a new blade was much better especially ATG. I think I'll keep using some other blades to see if there is something I like better. It's been awhile since I used Seville. I've been using the bath soap so it made me want to use the soap and balm. Most B&M soaps I've used lately have been either soft heart or omnibus but Excelsior still gives a great shave.",

But since it's still in transit, I've decided to give myself a break on my self imposed \"three shaves before switching soaps\" rule and just revel in the beauty of the Tusk base in general.\n\nTonight's shave was the first shave since August where I got a little bit of the Mood Indigo (or Indigo) magic back. 31 consecutive shaves with this soap really did a number on its wow factor for me. STILL Indigo is my go-to recommendation for new shavers looking to get into Mammoth's products and it is, to date, the only tub I've killed and repurchased (Pag's and YRP are close now). Very unique, booze-adjacent, subtly spiced, sneakily berried, pleasantly oudy and just about the easiest soap to lather.... which is not to say it's easy to get a perfect lather... but to say that even a crappy lather with Tusk has a lot more cushion than similar crappy lathers. MOIMO but Tusk is my go-to for new scary shave experiences and days when you don't give a fudge. It's so easy to get good results even if your lather thrill is waning.\n\nSingle pass shave. I'm training my replacement at work right now... remotely. She's older than me and a bit weird (she can't type on a regular keyboard? gotta be a split keyboard, etc) ... but I have to screenshare all day every day with her this week. So my energy levels are significantly down for BBS.",

When I got home decided to shave this evening and take my time. Did a 3 pass, wtg, xtg, and atg. Still struggling with getting a good pass xtg on my neck, but wtg and atg feel quite smooth. Went for a softer scent and the Col. Conk Bay Rum is pretty light once you rinse. The lotion was because the alum left me pretty dry and tight but a splash or balm would have been more scent than I wanted tonight. I have the scent free Curel and it is very neutral as far as scent goes. Plus, my dad was a dermatologist, and it was one of the lotions he used to give me from his free samples.",

This thing performs like a $15 synthetic. Super springy, sends lather flying everywhere even when just painting, and is really just a bad choice for face lathering. I regret purchasing this 100% and am in the market for a 2nd synthetic to go along with my Simpson Chubby 2 Synthetic. The Simpson would be a perfect brush for me, but the handle is just too small and makes bowl lathering (which I seldom do anyway) impossible.\n\nBarrel Proof is an S tier scent, I just wish it were stronger.\n\nMy first ever shave with a Gilette Silver Blue. Felt absolutely amazing during the shave but there was quite a bit of alum sting after the shave, which surprised me.",

Today's British shave items are the gorgeous Darwin razor from Sheffield and Mitchell's Wool Fat from Yorkshire in its rustic bowl.\n\nThe Darwin razor looks and feels ridiculously fancy. I will have to do a dedicated write-up and post it along close-up shots with better lighting to do it justice. Unfortunately - but unsurprisingly - the blades aren't really shave ready and will need a few rounds of honing to get sharp again, but I still decided to give it a try, with non-disastrous results. The Fat is nearly unscented to my nose, and upon contact with my damp boar brush, it immediately created a dense, creamy foam somewhere between protolather and froth. It came together quite well in the end, and I got good enough slickness to protect my face during the tuggy shave with the Darwin blade. I count that as a win for now. I didn't get a BBS shave (due to the blunt blade, no doubt) but good enough so look freshly clean shaven, and I had zero feedback from the Mühle splash.\n\nFor today's theme, I followed up with a couple spritzes of Imaginary Authors' *Every Storm A Serenade*, a wonderful aquatic scent with some woody twists.\n\nNo complimentary full English breakfast for me today, mumumu. Now off to the Airport and back to the continent!",

Nice and soft with hardly any backbone and BEST of all almost no spring! I've been on the hunt for a while for a synth knot without any spring and I finally found one. I've tried so many different kinds I was losing hope, but the Motherlode is what I was looking for. It has just enough backbone to not be a complete mop and still reform after splaying it out on my face to build the lather. This knot is also the exact opposite from my unbleached Zenith I am starting to break in.",

Silver Star had no such saving grace - the feedback was too intense all over to the point of being unpleasant in R1. Otherwise the SS was okay so at least I got a decent shave for the efforts.\n\nWinner of Round 1: Lord - Tajam.",

Just such a lovely cologne / incense / oud scent that works incredibly. I highly recommend it. The soap alone is fantastic as it's their most recent formula with added clay that adds a density and slickness that I really, really dig. It is strangely thirsty compared to other Italian soft soaps, but I think the clay ingredients is what attributes to it's thirst.\n\nHappy Thursday my friends.",

And we're supposed to get some thunderstorms this afternoon, so the soap is an even better fit.\n\nI've said it before (maybe not recently), but Chiseled Face is just so easy to work with. I'd recommend CF to any new wetshaver with zero hesitation. Not only that, but CF has some outstanding smells.\n\nStill enjoying the B15 knot. Felt a bit of scrub today that I didn't really get on the previous shave. Definitely more in the B4/B9A zone than the B2/B5 zone.",

Like this sample of Summer Storm that I won in a PIF last summer and had never used. I always get piles of slick lather from Chiseled Face and once lathered up this soap was no worse for having sat in various drawers for at least a year or two. A nice, vaguely aquatic scent and a smooth shave. This blade is surprising me with how well its holding up. By this time in Austere August I was ready to retire the blade but this one is still comfortable and hasn't had any rough shaves yet.\n\nTreachery smells like an indulgent dessert. Probably my second favorite from the Maher Olfactive sample set. Have a great Thursday everyone.",

It's nice. Not something I will get a tub of. Without the splash I used trythatsoap's matching feature for the first time and it worked perfectly. Of my splashes it picked Lavanille as the closest match-well done trythatsoap! Best part of my shave, and I'd forgotten how awesome Lavanille smells.\n\nTook a Nacet to 11 shaves today. First blade ever taken into double figures. The last few shaves, the Nacet treated me well. Today I had a few small nicks for the first time in a couple of months. Maybe I got cocky, I don't know, but it wasn't as smooth or as efficient as the previous 10.",

Old meets new, and gives a very close shave with no irritation!\n\nSetting 3 was great for mowing down multiple days of growth, but still keeping it comfy.\n\nRazor and Blade Performance/Comfort Rating: 4 out of 5 (Very Good)\n\n#### ䷀ Soap Notes\n*^(Mystic Water Soap - Marrakesh)*\n\nScent: I liked the warmth and woody-ambery spice. It was enough, but not too much. I liked that it had some strength. It may have started out too much, but sitting around for a couple of years I'm sure has mellowed it out, and with this one that's good for me.\n\nScent Strength: 5/10, present during shaving.\n\nLather... Revisited the MWS today, and lather wasn't as good as last time. Oh well, unless she changed her formulas, it must have been my imagination as to how good it was a few years ago.\n\nStill serviceable, it was just a bit foamy. Felt nice on the face and protected well, though. A decent soap.\n\nHydration: Perfect *(for me)*\n\n+ 35 sec load with a Lightly-Wet brush\n+ 5.5 tsp added to build the lather\n+ = 5 passes of lather\n\nBowl: [Roger Quintero 3D Printed Bowl](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3392930)\nI use the XL version of this bowl.\n\n#### ䷀ Brush Notes\n*^(Paladin - Lotus - Graphite 2CLSE5‹1 uses›)*\n\nPaladins lately have been either/or for me. Either they have great soft tips and I'm disappointed in the high backbone, OR the backbone is to my liking and the tips aren't nearly soft enough.\n\nThe good news on this one is that it's not along that paradigm, but the bad news is that both attributes are a bit off.\n\nThe tips aren't as soft as I'd like, but may not be too bad. The backbone is more than I'd like, but may not be too bad.\n\nI just need more uses on it with better soaps, to find out.\n\nI think the backbone that I don't like might drift into a happy place if this knot were just not as dense.\n\n----\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Almost Smooth\n*Neck*: Almost Smooth\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Cut flush to where I just see the tips (above average for me)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm) *and also in the sub's sidebar.*\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

No nicks/irritation. On theme today with an aquatic soap that should be good enough for April Showers. It's also an early birthday shave as this one comes two days before my birthday, so I just wanted to use some of my favorites for that occasion. They all worked perfectly for this one. The soap is a little challenging to lather due to its thirstiness, but I give myself a lot of time to get the process going in order to get the lather that I want. When properly lathered up, the soap performs excellently with great slickness, protection, glide and cushion. The razor/blade combo performed great as well, as it's smooth and efficient. Everything had to come together to make this one a great early birthday shave. Overall, great shave to cap off this week and to commemorate my birthday which is two days away.",

NO base was wonderful in conjunction with the huge fan knot brush - every fellow headshaver should try to get one of those by Andrew, they feel like magic on your noggin.\n\nTwo passes with the Parker TTO. Almost uneventful shave, except slicing off a small pimple behind my right ear. No other bleeding or irritation due to the quality products used today.\n\nTres Matres were the flowers for May today. I actually could smell the dank floral note too! As well as Davidoff Cool Water, an EdT I treasure since my early teens. All things combined might fit the theme, but due to my Covid nose I'm not sure how well they fit together. But due to home isolation, I also don't care. I feel better and my scalp is smooth, that's all that matters for now!",

Turns out I don't have any petrichor scents and didn't feel like Oceana, while being an aquatic scent, met the spirit of the theme. Went with Hamami because it has the wet stone note and I could see myself enjoying the scent on a rainy day. I would honestly enjoy this scent on any day, but that's beside the point. Yet again, the MMOC delivered a fantastic nick and irritation free shave.\n\nHope everyone had a wonderful Thursday and is enjoying Opening Day!",

These were the Tube 2.0, the brush, and the SE shave setting. I haven't been interested in trying the gigantic cube but the Tube is the perfect vehicle for getting their preshave onto my face. The brush is something I have wanted since I started wet shaving and it didn't disappoint. The SE shave setting did a great job of protecting my skin from the blade. There was no time during the shave that it felt like I could have cut myself which is exactly the point. The only negative aspect is needing to do quite a bit of work with pickups to get a smooth shave. It didn't cause irritation so not a big deal.\n\nThis was only a DFS shave, despite spending a good bit of time on pickups. The good part is that I didn't get Irritation. I'll say 8.5/10. Happy shaves all!",

This one is in the probably not pile, was good WTG and XTG but not ATG. I'm still learning to use this razor and working to find the blade I like the best. I'm pretty accustomed to a 3 pass shave with most of my razors but I think less is more is a better way to go with a blade gap like this. Hamami is probably the only soap that best fit the theme with the \"wet stone\". I'm not sure what wet stone smells like but I do get a \"mineral\" note in the frag. Other than that it's, citrus, woody and floral and a good springtime scent.",

TLDR: Not that great.\n\n#### ䷀ Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Wolfman - WR2 SB .85 Brushed ::: Perma-Sharp Super ‹10 uses›)*\n\nA nice combo, but the Perma-Sharp continues to be edgy enough to be careful with.\n\nVery close shave, with decent comfort.\n\nRazor and Blade Performance/Comfort Rating: 3 out of 5 (Good)\n\n#### ䷀ Soap Notes\n*^(K Shave Worx - High Peaks)*\n\nNotes: Cypress, Pine, Sweet Fruits, Citrus\n\nScent: I didn't really get outdoorsy vibes from this scent, which really is fine, because I don't really enjoy pine in my soaps. I got the cypress and sweet fruits pretty well, though I didn't really identify the cypress blindly.\n\nI enjoyed it. The performance of the soap, being a little lackluster, is the only thing keeping me from using it regularly.\n\nScent Strength: 4/10, present during shaving.\n\nLather... Somewhat slick, but lacked protection at the top levels. Not a good as Stirling, for instance.\n\nEasily rinsed off. Not much residual slickness.\n\nBut it does do the job.\n\nHydration: Perfect *(for me)*\n\n+ 0.3 tsp soap with a Lightly-Wet brush\n+ 3.7 tsp added to build the lather\n+ = 6 passes of lather\n\nBowl: [Roger Quintero 3D Printed Bowl](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3392930)\nI use the XL version of this bowl.\n\n#### ䷀ Brush Notes\n*^(Zenith - Horse Extra Soft - 507N XS‹10 uses›)*\n\nA little prickle but with the nice easy flex, not too bad. That soft flex has to be why I like to come back to this brush as often as I do.\n\n----\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Light irritation showed up at end\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Few hairs are showing some tip length (with most being cut flush)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm) *and also in the sub's sidebar.*\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

It's a bit of an odd ball - a bakelite razor which has differential blade exposure - one side is aggresive and has massive blade feel and the other is much milder. An interesting shave and I'll have to play with it a bit to work out how I like to use it but a fun one to get used to. I think there may be ab it of degradation on the cap as it doesnt look quite right but it doesnt appear to affect the shave (as far as I can tell). I've not heard too much about it but there is a [useful thread on the boomeriest of forums](https://www.badgerandblade.com/forum/threads/neillite-magic.471095/). u/djundjila with your magic tool to peek into SOTD history, can you say if anyone's used one here before?\n\n\nAs for lather, the fat performed well - u/iamsms recent video reminded me to keep adding water and then add a bit more, it also appeared to show that he's found a different route into u/merkius Grand Unified Theory of Lather. Maybe there is something to that madness.",

This is the last stop before it heads back to Europe. For my first go I used the 0.99mm base plate. This is a beautifully weighted razor that is quite visually appealing. Swiss design evokes many things to me, and the look of this razor fits perfectly into that schema of things. Smooth and efficient I didn't find too much blade feel at play. Some more shaves and trying the more aggressive 1.20mm plate will further the story over the next week.\n\nThere are so many awesome scents from the House of Mammoth catalog but Embrace is in my top 3 for sure. Sweet and warm, it's name is perfectly suited I find.\n\nWay more words then I was planning, but hey, it's Friday! I hope yours is sweet and warm. Peace.",

What a shave.\n\nI picked up the soap on the bazaar a couple weeks ago, but hadn't had a chance to bust it out yet. This base is fantastic. So easy to work with, and the smell is great. This should have been my theme Thursday soap.\n\nThe Bolzano was very smooth. Almost too smooth, as I wasn't sure I had a blade in a few times. It did get very close too. I did have to buff the usual spots, but I'm pretty impressed. I think I like the feedback I get from the Astra SP better, but the Bolzano is in the running.",

Ingredients are simple. Produced a voluminous white glossy lather with very good glide and cushion. Residual slickness was quite good as well. Seems to be a great soap. Will need to use it with a different razor as the Stando always leaves a bit of burn (blade is coupled with head and base quite far back from the edge of the blade) before I make a real judgement. Scent notes and ingredients are listed in the link above but I have to say it spot on smells like a pot of black tea. The only online reviews I could find were about three years in age.\n\nHave a good one.",

What I discovered is that the soap sample, stored in a ziplock bag, had gone from a soft croap to a dry, brittle block. The scent strength had gone from about a 7 to a 1, so it was virtually unscented.\n\nRemarkably, the soap produced a much better lather. I could add more water to it and it retained the water longer. Normally, when using the TGS base it can dry out quickly if it's not dialed in just right. When that happens the room starts looking like the Upside-Down. Even though the lather improved this morning, the lack of scent was disappointing. Followed the shave up with FYL for some almond-scented goodness after all.\n\nThe Karve E plate proved to be fantastic in spite of my initial apprehension towards using it. I'm finding that wider blade gaps work better for me, especially on my neck.\n\nRating: 3/5",

With the right amount of very mild pressure it soothes out and provides and excellent shave. B7 is not a very standout batch of hair but it has good backbone and was a pleasure to use.\n\nBorrowed hardware for today's shave courtesy of /u/ShavingInCT and /u/maru1021",

The only goal of this shave was to help me feel awesome - I succeeded!\n\nBasically I just picked items that I felt comfortable with - much like I often do when I stand in front of my wardrobe, choosing what clothes to wear. BM Reserve Classic is what I personally feel is Will's take on Tabac, but to my Covid nose something else was more in the forefront. Something more of a manly cologne, less grandma's purse.\n\nThe Derby Premium seems to finally be a good match for the Parker TTO, only got one tiny weeper right below my soul patch.\nProraso Red sandalwood splash feels great and I could smell a bit of it too, so that's also awesome.\n\nVery smooth Friday evening shave. As a bonus, since the logo on the tub of BM Reserve Classic reminds me of Judge Dredd, here's [Donbor - Against the Law](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5zVtifGxQE). Have a great weekend, folks!",

Sea Spice Lime\n\n**Post-shave:** Seaforth! Sea Spice Lime Toner\n\nHad a break this afternoon and decided to shave. Woke up late and almost missed a meeting. New blade today, and shave was a little rough. First shaves with this blade have been rough with previous ones, but second and third it gets smoother. At first I got the lather too wet, but loaded a little more and it got better. I do like the scent, but it is strong, so went easy on the toner. I think I might stop going for the across the grain pass on my neck, sometimes it feels like the corners of the razor are digging into my neck, but the blade not really doing much.",

Fortunately, this thing shaves as good as it looks! For three passes, I started by only using the OC side for the first pass, and then only using the SB side for the final two passes. Both sides of the razor are smooth and comfortable in use, but not so mild that they are inefficient in any way.\n\nI used to have more of a purist opinion that razors shouldn't be this fancy, and that they should more closely resemble notable vintage razors like the Gillette Tech, for example. However, I've now changed my belief that if you are going to invest in a razor like this then you might as well take advantage of the razor technology we have available now and go ALL OUT!",

First time I've had more than 26 hours of growth to mow down since late 2019. I'm trying not to be too bummed about it, but I'm a little disappointed that I let my streak die after 400+ shaves. I'm training my replacement at work... remotely. And she's not super computer savvy. And my boss went on vacation the day after she started so ... it's just me. This week has been... rough.\n\nThe good news is that my April Fools puck of Shire came today. My dad has been speaking Quenya (Tolkien's Elvish) on random hikes since I was very little. We're hardcore Tolkein heads from way back. I wasn't a wet shaver for the original release of Shire but I would've been super excited about it for the name alone, much like B&M's Melange.\n\nIt's... honestly a pretty perfect Hobbit soap. Warm, earthy enough to have hair on its toes but bright enough to have a twinkle in its eye with just a hint of tobacco. I'm not sure I love it yet... but that's a common reaction for me to something new. I think having it in splash form would help me decide. Shire belongs, after my admittedly initial impressions, in the same family as Summer Break Soaps Valedictorian. Tobacco adjacent, though Valedictorian leans more towards barbershop and Shire leans more towards floral.\n\nTusk is always awesome. Single pass, streak beginning shave.",

Three passes with the R 41 GT get everything BBS, and the SV splash somehow leaves the skin extra silky smooth, like Southern Witchcrafts toners or Pitralon. _Acqua Di Giò_ is what *Settantesimo* dupes, and the light citrusy scent is my wife's favourite, so in looking forward to her reaction later.",

The quick shave this morning produced surprisingly close DFS results. I knew I'd only have time for one pass, so the single XTG pass seemed to provide the most efficiency-to-comfort for me--no nicks or irritation.\n\nOuroboros is an interesting scent once lathered-it somewhat reminds me of Tres Matres, if it had a cedar note added to it. The base of this M&M soap sample was unusual, and really just unpleasant to work with. It was soft and sticky, had tiny, shell-like pieces, and the proto-lather was almost putty like. Even with all of that against it, the base did finally create a nice, slick lather. I think M&M firmed up their Aon base in 2019, so maybe this is an older sample.\n\nThis is my first time using IA's FitS, and I'm really liking the fragrance. It definitely conjures images of Summer, but it's light enough it can probably be worn anytime.\n\nRating: 4/5",

The result? Comparably close shave (honestly very hard to tell a difference) with similar alum feedback (minimal). However, the Wunderbar is so much smoother of a shaver, effortlessly gliding over the face. The Blackbird is going on the Bazaar as soon as I'm back state side, and I'll try to scoop a Ti SB version in the future. This razor doesn't lend itself well to an OC given how steep of an angle it likes, and I personally find the SS too heavy.\n\nSide note, really not a fan of the Moon Soaps base, it really lacks the slickness of higher end artisans. And Old School is a phenomenal scent, I just wish it were much stronger",

Comparing the Zenith B21 and Zenith B36 allowed me to make that happen.\n\nFor 2 brushes that have the same diameter knot, same loft, and quite similar uses, they feel quite different. The Chrome B21 is heavier than the B36. It isn't a large difference, but still one I can feel while using them side by side. The B21 also has slightly softer tips, but slightly more backbone. My B36 is still soft and not scratchy at all, but the B21's tips are just softer. It makes me wonder if when I was slightly impatient breaking in the B36 if the towel stropping I did broke off some of the finer tips (I stopped towel stropping altogether after that brush anyway so it isn't an issue with any of my other brushes).\n\nBoth brushes are incredibly comfortable and any boar user would be happy with this little bundles of backbone.",

What I like about it is that you can buff and do clean up passes until the cows come home and not get any irritation. The double open comb design actually does make for a slicker shave too. I would prefer a little bit more efficiency tbh, but it's fine for a mild razor. For the software I decided to just kill what was left of this soap in my sample bowl and continue trying to use up this Green Vetiver aftershave. This Flower City Orange Blossom is a nice citrus scent, but again, zero longevity. It's basically a skin scent an hour after applying it. I did 5 sprays too :/ HAPPY 4/20 dudes and dudettes!",

I absolutely love this splash scent, it comes off initially as vanilla extract straight out of the bottle then calms back down into a warmer vanilla sandalwood scent. I prefer this over the Stolen Heart BSG set that I have, but I prefer the Stolen Heart Soap over the Vanilla Sandalwood Stirling Soap. If this splash works out I'll probably end up buying a bottle of it since the scents are so similar and compliment each other so well.",

Timeless had a Kai blade with 3 previous shaves on it. Karve had a Gillette Silver Blue with 1 previous shave on it.\n\nWe know the lather was great with House of Mammoth Tusk base.\n\nBoth sides were a little sensitive to start with as I was too aggressive with the open comb yesterday. So I decided to try my mild razors. Both razors produced smooth shaves. The right side is a little more sensitive, but there was no blood. I am going to give my skin a day or two to recover.",

The nicest part was for once I finally used the omnibus base in a hood lather instead of ok, took a lot longer with it than I normally would, but well worth it. Blade count I lost track of, but it's been in for a bit so I wouldn't be surprised if it's in the 20s or low 30s, but I've also been lazy with shaving so it may be in the high 10s as well, just going to use it till it tugs too much.",

      "body": "#### [Taking One For The Team](https://i.imgur.com/NclzYU1.jpeg)\n\n* **Prep:** Klar Activated charcoal facial soap\n* **Razor**: EldrormR Industries - GEM Division: MM24\n* **Blade:** Personna GEM PTFE\n* **Brush:** Zenith 506U XSE unbleached 27 mm × 56 mm boar\n* **Lather:** Proraso Sapone da Barba Barbe Dure\n* **Aftershave:** Pitralon Swiss version\n\nI have a pretty good system for the efficient, painless, and quick destinkification of boar knots, and consists of a handful of hand lathers with activated charcoal soap. Works like a charm every time.\n\nOn the other hand, there's u/EldrormR (the \"R\" in his username stands for \"rank\" today) and [his repulsive strategy of rubbing the fresh pig smell out of the knot using your face 🤢](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/two2dx/tuesday_sotd_thread_apr_05_2022/i3h1638).\n\nWhen I shared my excitement about my newest, cutest brooshie, an unbleached Zenith 506U XSE arriving in the mail, he tried to convince me to use it the first time in all its stinky glory. A ridiculous proposition which I was quick to reject, of course, but then he pulled [this underhanded trick](https://i.imgur.com/Mx1v1v3.png) so here we go 🥺:\n\nBoar brushes stink when they are new, that's no secret. It can get a bit unpleasant, and for that reason, many people do some have lathers to take the edge of veggie using them for an actual shave, but it's typically not a big deal if you decide to immediately use them on your face. This unbleached knot's malodor, however, is in a different order of magnitude, it's not the same sport, it's not even played in the same stadium. Typically, there's a healthy smell of pigsty, but here, there's additionally a anaerobically fermented manure element that gets activated the second water touches that knot. Think the inside of a full porta-potty having marinated all weekend in the Texas summer heat after a chili eating contest. On your face. On your lips. With ammonia.\n\nOther than that, the brush already has soft, splitting tips and a healthy backbone. I can tell that I will get along famously with this brush shortly, and I'm in love with the beautiful olive wood grain of the handle.\n\nPitralon valiantly tried to save my olfactory sanity after this abuse, and failed. But I appreciated its pear scented effort. How does my trauma compare to your lived experience, u/EldrormR?",

G5C compares to other brushes in my den. I decided to do as best of a comparison as I could with the closest relative to the G5C that I have-the Grizzly Bay 26mm Fanchurian.\n\nFeel-wise, the Grizzly Bay outdoes the G5C, but not by much.\n\nI only used the Grizzly for the shave and palm lathered the G5C for comparison.\n\nI used appropriately the same amount of soap for each brush and was surprised at the outcome. Though I was expecting comparatively less, due to its characteristics, the Grizzly produced just about as much lather, it just held on to it more so than the G5C.\n\nI love both brushes. The synthetic is quick to use and does have a good feel to it. I think it is pretty close to the feel and behavior of a badger of the quality it seeks to replace. For the price, the G5C can't be beat.",

      "body": "**Fruity Witchcrafts Wednesday**\n\n* Prep: head and face wash w/ Balea Ultra Sensitive cleaning foam\n* Brush: CoolDog Leipzig 26 mm premium synthetic fan\n* Razor: Fatip Gentile chrome\n* Blade: Feather New Hi-Stainless\n* Lather: Southern Witchcrafts - Gravefruit II shaving soap\n* Post Shave: Southern Witchcrafts - Gravefruit II aftershave\n* additional care: Proraso - Wood & Spice beard balm (sample)\n\nOriginally I wanted to finally reduce my soap pile of shame by trying one of those I haven't gotten to but it got so late and I had to deal with some social anxiety that I decided f**k that, it's Witchcrafts Wednesday and I'm in the mood for some fruit.\n\nThe CoolDog Leipzig is slowly becoming one of my favourite brushes ever. I really love how it feels on my skin, how great it lathers up any soap and of course how it looks. Definitely will get HoM Indigo with my next paycheck to do it justice with a sweet SOTD photo. It'll be interesting to see how the AP Shave Co. SilkSmoke I ordered over Etsy compares to it.\n\nThe Gentile is one of the few razors that can make a Feather usable to me, otherwise it feels really rough on my skin. I shaved my head WTG and my face WTG and XTG, only had 4 weepers on the left side of my face because of some bumps.\n\nProraso beard \"balm\" sample was a big letdown. I trimmed my stache, soul patch and eyebrows short today and wanted something to promote some new, even growth. Why they call this a balm is beyond me: the texture is like hair gel, there's no shea or cocoa butter nor beeswax in it. Nothing that provides a bit of care and a bit of styling. But Menthol and Eucalyptus oil, cause yeah, at least your beard can feel cold. If anyone of you has ornamental facial hair like me, or likes to use beard oil/balm for their eyebrows, avoid this stuff. Proraso should stay with shaving software - beard care is evidently where they fail big time. Thanks for listening to my ~~TED talk~~ rant.\n\nHave an awesome Wednesday, dudes and dudettes!",

      "body": "**April 20th, 2022**\n\n* **Prep:** Wash face warm water\n\n* **Brush:** Col. Conk Badger\n\n* **Razor:** Parker 94R\n\n* **Blade:** Parker Platinum (5)\n\n* **Lather:** Sample of New City\n\n* **Post Shave:** Thayer Facial Toner Cucumber\n\nSoap sample I was given from WCS just said New City. I figure it is Chicago Grooming Co's Oleo Soapworks New City: Back of the Yard. WCS only has the splash on their site, so did a search and this is best fit I could find. Other sample they gave me was Pucker which is from same company. I smeared a pea sized bit on the bottom of the bowl and workedup a fairly thick lather, but just a little too much water. The last splash took it down to soft peaks. I have yet to make a lather yogurty like I see in shave videos, but usually at least get a nice slick lather. The scent description is raspberry and leather mostly. I got a mild fruity scent and a bit of a leathery musk to it. Before my shave, my daughter had a bath, and her bath bomb scent is dominating the room, so my nose might be a bit confused.\n\nShave 5 on the blade and still going well on the first 2 passes. Felt a slight tugging on my last pass, but could be more about my technique on my neck than razor or blade. I'll give it another shave and see how it goes. With the blades costing from $.10 to $.40, the urge to push a blade until it is really rough is gone. So 5-6 shaves is still better than trying to get a cartridge to last 10+ shaves. Beard wasn't very thick, having shaved daily for last several days. Tonight's shave is starting to feel as close to bbs as I have gotten in a while. I am really starting to enjoy the process more. Like when I started writing with fountain pens, the process has me slow down and just process how it feels to write, the feel of the nib on the page, seeing how the ink interacts with the paper. Shaving now is like that for me, with the process itself is pleasurable, with the scents, feeling the results, how an aftershave feels. I still haven't shaved off my full beard, but I am tempted. Maybe go to a goatee to get more face to shave.\n\nThe Thayers toner I really like. It cools the skin down and my skin is nice and soft. It might be as much a factor in getting the bbs feel as the rest of the shave. It was a more springlike day today, and when it gets hotter outside this cooling will really feel great.",
