The scent notes are:\n\n\nVetiver\nAmber\nFrankincense\nMyrrh\nBlack Pepper\nClove\nCedar\n\nIt's an unusual scent, and I wasn't sure I liked it when it first arrived; however, it definitely grew on me during the shave. I picked up a lot of clove and cedar. It's woody/spicy/earthy and a good match for bay rum. I really like Pinaud Virgin Island Bay Rum, and it was a great compliment to Bespoke #1. the LASSCO new formula continues to impress. Very slick, and post-shave is really terrific especially for a vegan soap.\n\nHappy Thursday!",

I've had it for quite a while and it took a lot more use than a soap to kill. Not my favorite scent but liked it enough to finish the bottle. Have to make room for the Guerlain Vetiver I just bought and the SA drop in a couple of weeks.\n\nOnto this shave, it was quick and easy, I think I only have 2 or 3 shaves left before the tub is done, lucky I have plenty of other scents in this base once it's gone. I'll definitely have a decent amount of liniment left over, the 2oz. bottle is deceiving.",

Song: Loving Cup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtJ34oFnpog)\n\n**Prep:** glycerin soap, hot shower\n\n**Brush:** [Stirling 24x51 mm synthetic] (https://www.stirlingsoap.com/synthetic-shave-brush-24mm-x-51mm/)\n\n**Soap:** [B&M Le Grand Chypre](https://trythatsoap.com/collection/300/?product_type=soap)\n\n**Razor:** [Stirling DE3P7S](https://www.stirlingsoap.com/stainless-steel-handle-de-razor-de3p7s/)\n\n**Blade:** [Voskhod Teflon](http://www.tryablade.com/blade/voskhod-teflon-coated)\n\n**Post:** Extra lather, [CL Unscented Balm](https://chatillonlux.com/collections/post-shave-salve/products/unscented-post-shave-salve), [B&M Le Grand Chypre AS](https://trythatsoap.com/collection/300/?product_type=aftershave)\n\n[The Rolling Stones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rolling_Stones) are the self-proclaimed \"World's Greatest Rock and Roll Band\", a moniker they gave themselves during the late 1960's and early 1970's. Though boastful, it is hard to argue given the seminal work produced during this time. So many great albums, but my absolute favorite is [Exile on Main Street](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exile_on_Main_St.), produced in the south of France in 1972. The Stones had abandoned England due to the prohibitive tax rates and lived, played and partied together in a booze and drug-filled haze. The result was Exile and you can hear the raw power in every track. It also includes some amazing session musicians on [horns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobby_Keys) and [keyboards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicky_Hopkins). [Loving Cup] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loving_Cup_\\(song\\)) is such a masterpiece of urgency, raw emotion and power. \"Give me little drink from your loving cup |\nJust one drink and I'll fall down drunk.\"\n\nFor the shave, I went with LGC which is a beautiful and fragrant trip to the exotic island of Cyprus. There are so many subtle scents that blend together to create a very elegant smell.\n\nPost shave, CL Balm and finished it off with more LGC goodness.\n\nHave a great day!",

So, I reached for my sample pack of Astra blades and went for my second pass. I don't know how I feel yet. The blade dragged a little and irritated my neck. Couldn't go ATG like my previous shave.\n\nPerhaps my soap was too dry, or maybe this blade isn't for me. That's to be discovered on the next shave this weekend. On the plus side, my samples of Jacinthe and Roam will be in by then!",

Declaration's soaps are very slick, but for me they lack the cushion that Wholly Kaw brings. Might be an unpopular opinion. Anyone else feel the same?\n\nI've heard from a few people here that Lab Blues and Med Preps are the same blade, only difference being Med Preps have a few extra steps for medical use. To me, Med Preps seem a little sharper and cut my beard easier, which I have also heard on badger&blade. Am I crazy? Is it just placebo?",

I went back to a sample that I opened last week. This was softer soap than the SW Lycan I had been using, so I think that meant I had more loaded up at the start. I didn't push the water addition as far and results were much better. Not as thick on the first pass, but plenty of lather that lasted through three applications. I should have stopped with two shaving passes, but things were going so well... It felt good during the shave, I just had 5 weepers. In some new areas such as the corners of my mouth and still some irritation on my neck and jawline. I am planning to switch over to the V2 head next week to see how that compares with these blades. Have a good one.",

I think since I never get bad shaves from my BBS-1, Wolfman, Mongoose that I don't feel it's worth the learning curve. I have to deal with people all day long so a cut up, irritated face isn't the best look. Or I'm just being a little bitch.\n",

I've now tried B1, 2, 3 and 4. B1 is extremely soft and truly just a fantastic brush all around. Based on one use, I'd say that B4 is nearly as good if not just as good as B1. The hype around B4 is very deserved.\n\nA great shave this morning with Nuavia Blu. I picked up a sample of this from Shave Dash a while ago. I want to not like this soap due a feigned moral stance about its price, but I can't help but like it. The scent is wonderful, and the soap is slick. The post-shave is excellent, and it really does check all of the boxes. Someday I'd love to own a full tub.\n\nHappy Friday everyone!",

When I left for work it was just starting to come down heavy so I'm sure the Subie is going to have a fun drive home. Driving in snow doesn't bother me, it's sitting on the closed interstate when other knuckleheads crash their cars for driving like an asshole.",

The \"canard\" duck fat base feels excellent and scent strength on Shiloh is more than adequate. The Latha-sized tubs are a little hard to lather up with, but it's a small inconvenience. I also picked up the matching aftershave, which is mentholated, and found it provided a real crispness to the citrus AdP profile. It also feels really good on the skin. A few ~~enablers~~ folks (u/JohnB413 being one, I believe) have reviewed this one at length and already sung its praises, so I'll just stop here and say I definitely concur with their findings and would recommend.

It's amazing how much different this head made today as compared to the V3 I have been using the last couple weeks (with the same blade). Today right from the start it felt effortless, zero tugging. Maybe a better lather technique also helped, but I was very happy with how close the shave was after just two passes. After the cold water rinse I did have some weepers under my mouth but didn't feel them during the shave and they closed right up with some alum. Great day as daddy day care, and a relaxing shave during nap time. Hope you all have a great weekend!",

I'd like to think he was just waiting for the perfect time to show up and in true style wanted it to be a surprise. The tracking did update once it was at my local post office though. Claus is certainly the softer of the B3 brushes or as /u/johnb413 has dubbed them \"Super B3\", I'm very happy about that because I like the feel of softer brushes.\n\nI haven't used a Gillette Slim in I couldn't tell you how long, most likely over a year. I've never been able to get a great shave out of them, but today was the exception absolutely perfect. Actually, it was so perfect I think I'll use it again and maybe this is a cue that I should work though some of my collection that has never seen any use.\n\nHappy Saturday guys. I'll leave you with my shitty photography skills and share my other [Declaration brushes](https://imgur.com/a/KR271)",

Today was my first time trying a PermaSharp, first time trying the C plate (been using the B plate), and first time using a Eufros soap. Ultimately it was a good, smooth, shave but a little irritation in the trouble spots. Gonna drop back down to the B plate for tomorrow, keep everything else the same and see what's different.\n\nI didn't know what to think of the scent of Ylang Ylang off the puck, but during and after lather I really enjoyed it. It seemed to lather well, and held its slickness throughout the shave.",

      "body": "My first safety razor head shave.\n\n* **Pre-game:** Hot shower, head wash with Jack Black's Pure Clean\n* **Prep:** Shaveology pre-shave oil and a hot towel head wrap\n* **Lather:** Proraso red\n* **Brush:** Semogue 1305 Superior Boar\n* **Razor:** EJ DE89\n* **Post:** Alum block and homemade bay rum aftershave\n\nThe head shave was different from my standard face routine in a number of ways. First, I've never been a pre-shave oil user. I guess I didn't understand the importance until I started watching the head shave videos and that drove me to pick some up before trying this out.\n\nSecond, the Personna is not my preferred blade. I'm a consistent Feather user when it comes to my face. The Personnas catch and drag when I use them on my beard (but I have 200 of them, birthday gift from my well-intentioned teenager). But for the head shave, I thought maybe I should go with something less ridiculously sharp than the Feathers, so I popped in a Personna and it worked beautifully.\n\nProbably took me about 30 minutes to do my whole head. I was going slow and I had to keep going back to hit spots I'd missed. When it was all said and done, I realized I hadn't addressed my sideburns area and I used a squirt of Jack Black's Beard Lube to take care of those in a hurry.\n\nAs a result of this experiment, I'm thinking I'll start incorporating pre-shave oil into my regular shave routine. And if I can get the head shave down to about 20 minutes, I may start working it in during the week on days when I'm not doing my face. I'm thinking that using the previously mentioned Beard Lube might be a good time saver on my scalp, but until I'm more comfortable with the whole process, I think I'll stick to only changing one variable at a time. One thing I definitely want to look into is finding a shorter, better knurled handle (either for my EJ DE89 or on a totally new but not terribly aggressive razor).",

After my recent success with Feather blades in the Feather AS-D2, I had this nagging question in the back of my head: maybe Feathers are not as bad as I remembered them???\n\n\n\nSo I took the Guerrilla - normally for me a mild and smooth, yet very efficient razor - and tried it with a Feather. I even remembered, that usually the first shave with the Feather blade is the worst and so I took one, that had already one shave in it....\n\n\n\nWell after the second pass, I should have changed the blade. Even the [extremely slick and protective Stirling lather](https://i.imgur.com/jhssVMb.jpg) produced by the fantastic Shavemac unique knot could not save the day. A couple of nicks and a handful of weepers later, this torture shave was over - the worst part being, that it was not even really closer than with a Ladas blade.\n\n\n\nSo for me the Feather blade will only be used with a Feather razor - at least until my next stupid Sunday ;)\n\n\n\n**I hope you all have a relaxing Sunday**",

Thanks to /u/starvinghippo I was able to get a tub and was very happy with it out of the gate. Off the puck it was a very sweet smell, like a Starbucks vanilla frappechino. Once lathering up it settled into more lighter pipe tobacco tones. Extremely pleasant overall, my wife is very happy about this one. The shave was okay, I think I starved the soap a bit of water because it still felt thick after the second pass and there was plenty left in the brush. I feel like this razor head does a much better job of cutting so I feel like I am using no effort, but I am still ending up with weepers at the end of the shave. Happy with the closeness just still feeling a few regions of irritation on my neck. I still need lots of practice, but I am still enjoying the ride so far.",

Got this soap on loan from /u/nex_renegade (thanks buddy) and I'm so glad to *finally* smell/use this scent. It was really nice but to be honest, nothing I would go too crazy over. Can't remember the last time I used white label and I don't currently own any. I found the lather easier to create actually, but the slickness and protection of glissant don't tend to be there. Still a very good soap mind you, but for me it was a bit of a reminder of where we were and just how fortunate we are with the current products out there.\nGoing to try and really take in this last day of relaxation before getting back to a full work week.",

Of course I don't have a lot of fern choices so it's going to be a short trip. I had a sample of Reserve Fern several months ago and gave it away. It was too ferny for me. I decided to revisit it because I felt like I appreciate ferny scents more now. Sure enough I liked it more than I did before. I am not sure about a full tub but it's good and I can see why it has fans. Happy Sunday!",

After lathering I decided it wasn't my cup of tea. Switched to the Jacinthe. It has a nice sweet, floral, green scent. Like Sinfonia this will probably not be a full size purchase for me. Although good I can't see myself reaching for it on a regular basis.\n\nFinally got around to trying a Personna blade. Was a bit rough the first pass with 48 hours of growth but was pleasantly smooth for the next two. Need to try it a few more times with just 24 hours of growth.\n\nAmouage Reflection Man caught me a bit off guard. More spice and wood than I expected. Going to try to wear it a few more times before Friday.",

This would be a good daily driver, but not one I'd pick for multiple days growth.\n\nThe soap in the picture was another user's test batch. I pretty much never bowl lather, but I had to throw it in something to load it. It's always fun to sample someone's soap and provide feedback. Prior to this one, the last test sample I tried ended up turning into none other than Storybook Soapworks :)\n\nHoping work doesn't get too wild today.

I have been killing off Cade Rich, but I knew I would likely take a break from it to use other stuff. I stropped a razor and started soaking the boar before my shower. As I was in the shower it occurred to me that I hadn't used WMS in a little while, so I figured I would use that today. I loaded up the brush and started working up the lather on my face and was reminded that this soap went back a long time, to 1840. I imagine my grandpa used it at one time or another.\n\nThinking of my grandpa, who passed away before I was born, I remembered his two straight razors and strop that were handed down to me a couple of years ago. They had been buried away in my uncle's home since the 1950s. Anyway, with the lather on my face, I decided to use one of those straights. I chose the one that my grandpa had scratched his nickname in the scales...\"Red\". He was a red headed Irishman. I don't know which of the two razors was the one he used the morning he passed away, but neither of them had been used since he last used them over 60 years ago.\n\nI stropped that razor up and went at it thinking about a simple man raising a dozen kids during the depression. I felt the pull of history and the humility of this honest working man. I can't say the shave was the most comfortable I ever had because the blade could use some TLC on a hone. But it was one of the best shaves I will ever have because it connected me to my grandpa who I never met. I'd be lying if I said I didn't get a tad misty.\n\nY'all have a good start to the week.",

Of course, fantastic performance from WK today. This blade, however, is done. I get 3 shaves with Personna Platinum blades easily, and sometimes I can push it to 4. Occasionally, it just doesn't work, and today was one of those days. The amazing WK lather saved the shave, but I need to remind myself next time I'm tempted to have a 4th shave to just bin it.

Still a very nice, rich scent that reminded me of Beaudelaire (from memory; haven't sniffed that one in awhile) though not quite as intoxicating. The Fougere Classique Tonique paired better with this one for me, and I definitely came away with a pleasant smell and feeling from this shave. Unlike last week, I'm not dreading this week at all and I think I can credit the restful weekend for that. Thanks to /u/ItchyPooter for the ear worm from yesterday's SOTD, found myself singing a little ditty in my head as I walked away from the sink: Ain't no stubble on this train, this train.

Checks all the boxes of what you want in a soap (well maybe not scent, since it is very mild) and is easy to lather. Also been using my Slim a few times in a row and like any other option in this hobby, if you use anything (razor, soap, blades, etc.) multiple times in a row, you really dial it in. Those who think the Slim may be too mild - I pretty much glue mine down on \"4\" - are mistaken. I can get a DFS/BBS without much effort. Great Monday shaves to all.",

I have been on the fence on it for a while. When I started wet shaving, I absolutely hated this scent. Fast forward 4 years and I gave it a whiff on a trip to the holy land. I had just recently acquired Fougere Gothique, La Forêt de Liguest, Reserve Fern, Beaudelaire, and Cape Verde. I was like, \"Yeah, I'm in love with fougeres. They can't do me wrong. Let me sniff this... Well there's definitely a green note. Moreso than Vert Noir. But, the underlying scents smell ok. I'm just going to pass on it for now.\" Didn't buy it.\n\nThen, on a whim for Valentine's Day and I bit the bullet (alone with Lavande Poivre because Champs de Lav is bae). I was excited to try the soap. Upon lathering, I don't know what /u/hawns put in there but it smells like a barnyard which is not my most favorite of scents. How did he create a wonderful scent with LfdL and decide TSM Fougere should be permanent? Blasphemy!\n\nWell, here I am. I have used this soap three days now and a conquest to kill it. Selling won't get me much. I don't want to PIF such an ungodly scent. And there really isn't anything out there I want to trade for. Luckily, the base is so good (bless you /u/declarationgrooming) that I can fight the scent and enjoy the shave. I have a rotation of Reserve Fern, Fougere Gothique, La Forêt de Liguest, and La Fougère Parfaite aftershaves to help me get through this.\n\n/u/hawns, why have you foresaken me?",

Those people are wrong. First of all, drama is interesting. Would you rather see the game go into overtime or have the scrubs playing mop up duty in a blowout? Second of all, if you're substituting the word \"drama\" for \"conflict\", you're really missing out. We can have grownup talk and give and take criticism without it downgrading into a complete shitshow, right? Like, don't you have to do that at work and with your family from time-to-time anyway?\n\nAnyway, Aether. You know with a prologue like that, shit is about to start flying.\n\nI've made no bones about it - I think Grooming Department's approach has been, charitably, ham-handed and tone deaf. Less than charitably, like my main man SassafrasJones said, the brand is [the shaving equivalent of an Aerosmith cover band that hates Aerosmith.]( https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/7p6jn2/dealsnew_products_tuesday_jan_09_2018/dsix7we/)\n\nI tried to leave my feelings about the brand behind and experience Aether for what it is in a vacuum. *Tried*. I *tried*. I don't want to sink the hatchet directly between GD's shoulder blades for nothing, and over old beef. I'm but a petty and flawed human who loves a good hatchet job. But still, there's no personal joy in sending up a hatchet job for solely a hatchet job's sake.\n\nAfter /u/Hyvasuomi79 wrote his [SOTD review]( https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/7ftyao/monday_sotd_thread_nov_27_2017/dqehtse/\n), I became almost immediately morbidly curious. \"It smells like something decaying\" he said, \"and it was covered up with mint.\"\n\nOh, word? Surely not, right?\n\nFortunately, /u/whiskyey got his hands on an OG first run Aether and sent it my way, along with a Declaration B3 knot, for testing and review (**SPOILERS**: B3 is great, but not my preference; Aether is not great, and also not my preference).\n\nOur resident in-house counsel and forthcoming /r/wetshaving moderator might be onto something here, and I can add nothing more to the bullseye description of decay unsuccessfully masked with spearmint. [Aside: when \"decay covered with mint\" is a kid gloves treatment of the product at hand, you know you might need to take it back to the lab and start back at square effing one.]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2G-m9jSVSJM&t=469s)\n\nBut, he's completely correct. There's no way to candy coat this. Shit stinks. The scent notes of Aether have been listed as: peppermint, citrus, fennel, sage, ginger, clary sage, cedar, amyris. Let's do a quick fish ass roll call:\n\n**Peppermint**? Not fish ass.\n\n**Fennel**? Black licorice bullshit, but definitely not fish ass.\n\n**Sage**? GranGran's Thanksgiving stuffing, and definitely not fish ass.\n\n**Ginger**? Snaps. Stir fries. Not fish ass.\n\n**Cedar**? Trees. Fish don't live in trees. Not fish ass.\n\n**Amyris**? The fuck is amyris? *googles* Okay, woodsy. Another tree in which a fish does not live. Not fish ass there either.\n\nSo I think it's clear that Aether is not supposed to smell like this. My non-expert, non-soaper, non-chemist, non-perfumer opinion is that something went off. If it's not the essential/frag oils (those don't spoil, do they?) it has to be something in the soap base itself that turned green and fuzzy.\n\nThere is good news in this: the fish ass, while undeniable, is at least not on purpose, I'm reasonably certain. It wasn't a bad shave at all, all things considering. For one, the human body has a defense mechanism of sorts when dealing with fish ass: [Olfactory Fatigue.]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olfactory_fatigue) Bottom line, by the time you get to the second pass, your body has physically rejected the fish ass. The fish ass is, in a sense, a cold swimming pool - the hardest part is just jumping in. One you're in, you're in (sure, your peen might be hopelessly flaccid and you're not going to impress any lady passersby, but all in all, you're no worse off for it).\n\nI was thinking about praising the performance of the soap base. It lathers easy. It seems pretty slick. No irritation. Good glide. No problems at all...but we still have the fish ass to deal with. If the fish ass isn't part of the frag accord, and I think we can conclude that, then it's the soap base. And fish ass disqualifies the soap base out of hand. Slick? Fine. Protective? Fine. Dense? Fine. But I never thought I'd have to say this, but all those good properties of a high-performing soap are all very, very, very much in a tie for second place behind the gold medalist soap property of \"not smelling like fish ass.\"\n\nTherefore, I cannot even praise the performance.\n\nBut it was quite a ride.",

House lost power Friday afternoon, actually the entire town lost power during the Nor'easter. My sister was fortunate enough to not be effected, and gracious enough to invite us to stay until we got our power back. Thinking it would only be the night, I brought no shaving stuff with me. Well that wasn't the case, and the initial estimate for recovery was tonight at 11:45 p.m. Yesterday my wife and I went to our house to check for any damage, shovel the snow, throw out the food in the fridge and freezer and get more clothes. I also packed some shaving stuff, as I was desperate for a shave. The shave was great, and I love Promises more and more with each use. We did get power back late last night, but too late to go back home as my boys were already down for the night. I'm very much looking forward to sleeping in my own bed tonight.",

I do understand the comments about a liquid smoke heavy note especially right off the puck, but like many of the other stronger scented soaps I have tried recently, it mellowed out much more once working into a lather. I get more of a cowboy campfire vibe even now a few hours later. I am looking towards exploring it a bit more over the weekend before making a decision to invest in a puck and/or post shave. I am especially interested in hearing from those who have tried the EdT. The shave was very decent, I do like this V2 head much more than the V3. Even on the third day with this blade, my arbitrary stopping shave as I plan to work through the rest of my sampler pack, it felt like I got a much better shave with less effort in only two passes. The lather was great, very slick plenty of soap for another pass easy was still left in the brush. Have a good week all.",

I appreciate eucalyptus scents, and this one is terrific. It does have a fairly strong menthol kick, so be aware if menthol is not your thing.\n\nI love Noble Otter soaps. I've praised their performance and scents, but perhaps the most unsung aspect of them is the post shave. I was seriously impressed after rinsing the soap off of my face. It was like I had already applied a balm. That good. I'm surprised the post shave performance doesn't get more attention. It's up there with the big boys in my eyes. Great shave this morning.

So I picked the big kahunas first based on their profile and my expectations of them: first Fougere Imperiale and then Fougere Aromatique. Well, as it turns out I ended up liking Aromatique more then Imperiale, and I believe my quote yesterday was that Aromatique reminded me of, \"Beaudelaire though not quite as intoxicating.\" That may or may not be true (the drydown on the splash is at least reminiscent), but what is true is that today's Fern Train arrived at the Truthtown Station. Beaudelaire soap is the truth. Beaudelaire aftershave is the truth. B4 is the truth. I need more time with this brush, but I will say it feels like a dead ringer for B2 - which is no bad thing. I need to spend more time comparing B1, B2, and B4 but they are all simply phenomenal.",

I have the French luxury old 8oz tub version and have used it on and off a few times. Truthfully, I don't think the soap is anything special from a performance aspect. I love the scent and think that is wonderful but I've never ranked it at the top tier for performance. Don't get me wrong it's a solid soap and I'm glad that I have it but I wouldn't put it up there with Declaration or B&M. I have a tough time getting a think, sour cream like lather out of it. I'm not sure how much the soap factors into the BBS aspect of shaving but I'm not BBS this morning like typical. So, nothing negative just surpised that it ranked on the same level of B&M. Hey whatever that's what we have choices, right?",

It was scraping my face up something awful).\n- *Brush*: Maggard synthetic\n- *Post*: Sherlock AS\n\nI woke up pretty early this morning, not on purpose. Haven't been sleeping well. We found out over the weekend that we owe more on our Federal Taxes that we anticipated. Like *a lot*. Like *\"how much is a kidney worth? You can survive with only one... right?\"* a lot.\n\nSo this morning I'm staring myself down in the mirror, feeling sorry for myself and angry that we made such a costly error. And about that time my bathroom door swings open and in shuffles my sleepy eyed two-year old.\n\n\"Goo mor-nin dad-ee.\" He mumbled as he walked over to me. My little buddy ended up perched on the counter next to the sink for the rest of my shave. He played his favorite game of \"Wassat? And dat? And dat?\" While I finished shaving I explained the finer points of the tools and techniques of the wet shave. Kids are funny like that: dropping perspective on your unsuspecting ass like some tiny little zen teacher..\n\nThis morning really reminded me of what's important and just how lucky we are. Yeah we owe a bunch to the IRS, but we have great healthy kids, we're both well employed, we have a house we love. We'll get it figured out.\n\nI was reminded of /u/Old_Hiker's shave yesterday. Sometimes the shave isn't about the shave.\n\nHave a good day ya'll.",

In retrospect, I really should've donned my denim coveralls, a straw hat, and the tall waterproof waders. It gets sloppy up in this barnyard.\n\nBut I persisted, got some barn lather flying, and went nice and easy with 3 passes, which is a rarity for me. I also made sure to drag my waders along the [wiener dog boot scraper](https://i.imgur.com/pK3pbOw.jpg) before exiting the bathroom and going to sit down to have my morning victuals, as not to upset the missus.\n\nVery nice shave this morning with a first chair-level fern.\n\nIf this smells like either an old lady's house or a barnyard, then that's me IRL on the left:\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/rNlyh8B.jpg",

Really relaxing shave after an evening of bottling my homebrew. Porter came out to right around 7.1%, so I'm quite happy.\n\nFlying Hide was excellent. I'm glad I received it as a bonus from my last Noble Otter order. It's such a well balanced scent and lasts a while after without being too strong. I'm hoping this scent doesn't go away when the shop re-opens. I also really want to try The Trail now, too.",

I normally bloom my soaps but with the softer soaps lately I haven't been and I have been liking that I find I have more control over the lather. The scent of this Donut Shop soap is fantastic I love it a very unique scent too, and the performance of Storybrook Soapworks base is always amazing. I have very sensitive skin and this is always a winner for me! Hope everyone has a great day and enjoys their shaves!",

Went back to face lathering since I'm traveling and the lather was so much better than I've been getting in the bowl at home. I want to get better at bowl lathering so I probably won't give it up completely but I got so much more cushion and glide today. I'm in the desert so I figured I'd double up on the post shave, really love the Trismegistus scent!",

Ended up with this beauty from andersenpottery on Etsy.\n\nFirst spin with Fougere Bouquet, in my mind it's the best Wholly Kaw scent, will be picking up a whole tub when it becomes available in the new vegan formula, should I do the AS and EDT to match? (...hmm)\n\nThe Rockwell R4 plate is smooth and worked well for me today, I second everything said by others about it - smooth but seems to be quite efficient . Of course it didn't remove as much on my WTG pass, but ATG + a little clean up around the neck and I was good. My first try of the Nacet blade, it reminded me of my Astra SPs a lot, but more feedback from the alum than I'm used to...wonder why.\n\nStirling products are an amazing value and smell great!\n\nHaving dinner tonight with a friend whose brother died of Lukemia. It's the second time someone I know has gone due to AML. Shoutout to their fam.\n\nHope everyone has a great day and a great shave!",

Very happy with the shave, this blade's first use had a few more tugs not quite as buttery smooth as my last try, but over all I was happy with the result. I still had a few red spots at the end after getting cleaned up from the places around my chin where I was buffing a bit too much instead of re-lathering and going in for a third mini clean up pass.",

I was like \"damn, I'm old\".\n\nIt's funny. When I was a kid, all I could think about was being older, and more independent. Now that I'm getting older, all I can think about is being young again.\n\nAnyway. I love LGC. Hands down my absolute favorite scent, and I prefer the retro packaging over the permenant editions, when I run out of this, and order a new set I'm just putting all the new stuff in the old containers. Now, if only I had a matching label for the EdT *cough*\n\nREX ambassador gave me an incredibly smooth shave. I just shaved yesterday, so I had about 24hrs worth of growth. I feel pretty Damn good. Smell good too.\n\nOff to class now. Have a great day guys!",

I've pretty much pushed past the limit (for me) of this blade at 6. I think I'll stick to 3-4 for now. The result was great, nice and smooth but it was clearly less comfortable.\n\nI'm going to start some blade exploration for tomorrow's shave and revisit some blades that I haven't used in a while.",

I mean like Barry Bonds peak steroids into McCovey Cove smokes it out of the park. Finished with Lavanille for a darker lavender end. Will be coming back to this one again and again.

BR Fern is a very, very nice scent, but it's also almost average. I'm thinking that it (Fougere Royale that it was modeled after) was so amazing and innovative when it came out that so many scents through the years have mimicked and, perhaps, equaled or surpassed it. Respeck to the original though. Anyway, was a nice little shave, Reserve base doing it's thing, and then time for the aftershave - which I consider the best that I own. Well as I applied it I got a really bitter/sharp scent that I don't remember picking up before. It went away fairly quickly, but so did the smell of the shave. The scent on the AS is notably weaker than the Toniques I've been using thus far. No worries though as it allowed me to finally wear a frag again so that I can be prepared for this week's discussion.\nHappy Humpday Y'all",

After some folks asked me about it I was told to give the luxury stuff a whirl. Since I'm a full fledged soap hoarder, I just happened to have some of the newer stuff lying around. I must say, that the luxury formula is much better than the french stuff. The sour cream lather was missing yesterday, but not today. I'm going to revisit the french soap tub again and see if I just messed something up, but I do think that the reformulated luxury formula is better thus the reason why the CB line moved to this newer base.\n\nEnjoy the day guys, work closed because of the snowstorm that is currently going on outside my kitchen window. I should really go get some wood for the wood burner before we really get buried.",

Soap consistency is on the softer side, similar to Declaration or Storybook Soapworks. Great lather, solid post-shave. The scent was refreshing as well- a very natural, well supported fresh apple scent. This is not a jolly rancher esque scent. I used Try This Soap to search products with Apple and ended up using Fine Platinum which went well with the soap in my opinion.\n\nI haven't been wet-shaving for very long- but the consistent level of quality of products from new artisans is very impressive, which is exciting.\n\nHappy Hump Day!",

He has also kept true to his 60's activism, protesting [Keystone Pipeline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keystone_Pipeline#Keystone_XL) and [The Iraq War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Living_with_War) as well as being an early adopter of [bio-diesel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biodiesel).\n\n[Old Man] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Man_\\(song\\)) was released on [Harvest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvest_\\(Neil_Young_album\\)), Neil's 4th studio album and still my personal favorite. It also includes [James Taylor] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Taylor) playing banjo on the studio version. \"Old man take a look at my life, I'm a lot like you\"\n\nFor the shave, every other day goodness on with Summer Storm.\n\nPost shave, CL Balm and finished it off Petrichor for the deep earthy scents of New England in fall.

Definitely don't want to be wasteful since it's discontinued.\n\nI figured it would be a good time to break out the balsam/pine/cedar scent for the (hopefully) last winter storm of the season. We were supposed to get slammed with snow, but it's already turning to rain. I think I'm okay with that, though.\n\nAlso, I can't get enough of Stirling's Bergamot Lavender splash.

While I was a face lather kind of guy, the scuttle has been a welcomed accessory the past few months. My time with my beard is growing short, as the competition is coming in approximately 4 weeks. My wife is ready to see it go (at least to a much shorter version that it is now) and in many ways, so am I. The upkeep is crazy. Shaving is more enjoyable as is it being easier to do.\n\nThe shave itself was quite nice. For New York is a masculine scent but not over powering. The lather is fine, though I wouldn't rate it as high as say Soap Commander. It gets the job done but can be heavy on the parfum - it tends to linger longer than other soaps which is fine if that's your thing and/or you enjoy the scent youre using. I also have Razorocks \"Tuscan Oud\" and that sticks with you for several hours, no AS needed.\n\nI am also expecting my JAH straight soon as well, according to USPS' tracking...I'm very excited to see it in person.",

It was my very first artisan soap I ever bought. Up to that point, I'd be using strictly traditional products -- MWF, TOBS, La Toja, Speick, Proraso, Trumpers -- and really didn't know what I was in for.\n\nIt's a shame that the Groomatorium wasn't at the Death Star level of fully operational back when Strop Shoppe was taking L after L after L. If so, perhaps Ron could've gotten her aboard his island of misfit artisans and into his Artisan Rehab Program -- slap some slick new labels on the jars, handle production and fulfillment, separate the wheat from the chaff on the expansive product line (or the Baker Street from the Teak Wood and Russian Tea), up the frags, and call it good. I think the soap base itself still holds up nicely even years later in a post-Bison, post-Reserve, post-WKDM world.\n\nI used to mourn a little every time I used these Strop Shoppe products, but I'm okay now. When I see things like Declaration rolling out a new soap base after testing it for 6 months, Chatillon Lux continuing to up his game and improve on his craft with every release, newcomers hitting the ground running and murdering shit straight out of the gate, I know there are so many great things ready to replace any beloved product.",

My wife let me clear off the top shelf of the cabinet in the bathroom that was previously used for decoration stuff. My shelf was starting to get cramped with the recent acquisitions and it was starting to get tough to reach everything in the back. Adding another shelf doubles my current capacity and adds some temporary relief.\n\nThe shave was good. I'm still getting used to the softer brush. My lather probably could have used a little more water, but overall pretty satisfied.",

The scent is definitely coconut, but it's fairly heavy on the vanilla too. It reminds me of the beach quite a bit, and I suppose that's the vibe I was looking for. It's simple but nice sent. This was my first time using a Turtleship product. The soap is quite hard, but I had no trouble loading. The Timberwolf knot is very good, and it worked perfectly even though it's on the softer side. The performance was also surprisingly good. No, it's not going to make anybody's top tier, but it's more than adequate and definitely has a place in a shave den if any of the scents appeal to you.\n\nHappy Thursday everyone!",

I'm certain it wasn't the lather, as PdP lathers easily enough and works well with my DE razors. However, on this shave, I was feeling some tugging and it didn't feel as smooth as it has. On my next shave, I'm going to use Soap Commander (a known constant performer) to decide if it's the blade or that PdP wasn't the quite right fit for the shavette.\n\nSide note: I'm looking forward to the beard competition. Lately my beard has been annoying the hell out of me, mainly due to its length. Eating/drinking is a PITA.",

It froze and we got some snow overnight, and methinks it was enough to make this train skid off the tracks and fall into a fiery death. Not sure what it is in this scent (other than everything) that makes it nowhere near as bright/green/fresh smelling as the first four more conventional fougeres I tried. I do like the scent on Fougere Gothique, it's so rich and well done, but it feels like I stepped outside the scent category. No worries though, I will [dance with the devil](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qggxTtnKTMo) today to keep me warm from the freezing weather and snow, and then brighten things back up tomorrow when one of my favorite scents in my den hopefully provides the fuel it needs to get this train bolting out of the fiery wreckage like a [bat out of hell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QGMCSCFoKA).",

You don't want someone at the controls who wants it too badly. You need someone who has better things to do, stable and important shit going on in their lives, who already has a measure of power and responsibility. The lure of power, no matter how small and seemingly innocuous, consumes the small man. While it's true that power corrupts, it's particularly corrupting to ineffectual, inconsequential, impotent men who've never before had it. It's the \"power\" of the bully, the beat cop, and the IRS auditor.\n\nAccidentally and by way of the lost art of consistent contributions, engagement, generosity, and you know, not being a complete dickbag, /u/Hyvasuomi79 built genuine trust within the community. Unsurprisingly, that hard-won trust was the foundation upon which his successful run for moderator was built.\n\nThe sub is in a fractious state. Factions. Divisions. Cliques. Hate Barns. Smaller and more exclusive Hate Barns within the larger Hate Barn itself.\n\nBut the night, the night, is always the darkest before the dawn. Once upon a time in our nations' bleakest and most divided history, it took a lawyer from Kentucky to show true leadership, and begin the process of reunification.\n\nCould the sub's own lawyer from Kentucky bring back together this community? I vote yes.",

More often than not, dressed in a suit, or at the least - slacks and a sweater. Doc always had a pipe clenched in his teeth, one of many in his extensive collection. The house had a rich smell of warm tobacco, musty old books, aged leather from his sitting chair and... that smell that homes don't get until they're nearly 100 years old.\n\nMidnight Stag isn't a dead ringer for that old house, but it's close enough to stir memories I've not visited in over 25 years...\n\nHave a good day ya'll.",

No irritation.\n\nI remember there was a time when I thought I'd never go without drawing a bit of blood or having at least a little post shave burn - I've gotten a lot better now and I can feel this becoming second nature (of course I'm not there yet, sometimes I get careless!)\n\nHave a great day!",

No meeting invites, no brown bags, or attempts to reach out to me to see how I am doing. Even more irritating is the person that transitioned off the supporting those teams was supposed to bring me up to speed, nope.... So much for leadership principles and ownership......",

I've heard it described as everything from \"nursing home\" and \"geriatric\" to \"pleasant\"--but far more of the nursing home type comments. Unfortunately, I'm going to have to agree with the former camp. This scent is just not for me. It was better when lathered, and there were times when I started to think \"this isn't that bad,\" but then whatever it was that I didn't like about this scent would creep back in. I'll probably be PIFing this one.\n\nThe performance was excellent as many have mentioned and very, very slick. Also, as to the issue of whether it's the same base as Fine soaps: I don't think I'd say it is the same base. Similar for sure, but identical? I don't think so after one use. Anyway, I'm glad I got to use a product that's been on my list for a long time. Happy Friday everyone!",

Again, I only went one pass, and it wasn't nearly as close as I like, but did the job. There was a bit of tugging though. Also black tea and matcha is a great way to get way over caffeineated!",

      "body": "[Breakin' Out The Old Soap Box](https://i.imgur.com/TuoypR4.jpg)\n\n**Prep:** Pulling down my box of old shaving stuff\n\n**Soap:** MLS Guiness and Goat Milk\n\n**Brush:** Kent BK8\n\n**Razor:** Scottish Razor Co. SRC-01 kamisori\n\n**Post:** Folsom & Co. ShamPow\n\n**Smellz:** Tauer L'air du Desert Marocain\n\nWell, as long as I'm back to stay, I figured I'd pull down my big box of \"I won't get rid of this but it's not staying in my rotation either\" and bust out some treasures until there aren't no more treasures to behold.\n\nThis is the original MLS - before the name, before the site, back when /u/mickey_lee was mailing soap to people in glass jars and coffee filters. I actually only scored a coffee filter one, and had no hope of grabbing one of these \"Only 4 out there\" jars but managed to nab one off of the original owner, who I'd totally thank but I don't remember who it was. Also I discovered that one of the 4 was lost to a move or something, so there's only 3. It's... old. Obviously they've improved over the years. Not terrible by any means, though. Coco Maya is still their masterpiece, fight me.\n\nThe razor... well, the theme of this shave is cool old products, not a great shave. What can you do? It's a rough one. I believe we decided that #2 onward would be a bit softer on the hurts-my-face scale. But, /u/phteven_j was nice enough to bless me with it and it always has a place in my den. Just maybe not a place on my face.\n\nShamPow is seriously still one of my favorite things in my cabinet. It's half Shambala, half Black Powder, all perfect. I've used it so sparingly, I should really just stock a backup of both and then I'll technically have two more bottles behind this one. I don't know what it is about it, I just like the combo. Far more than I like either one on its own, although I'm also a fan of them as well.\n\nL'air... it's strong and it's heavy but it's beautiful and I love it. It was my big jump into things that weren't bargain bin Nautica cologne my mom got me on clearance after Christmas. I was already convinced that /u/bostonphototourist knew everything and I knew nothing, but I pulled the trigger on this after he talked about it and from then on I was just like man, everything Will does is perfect except Roam which is an abomination. Again, fight me.\n\nAnyway, who else is still on that Monster Hunter World grind?",

If you like outdoorsy and pine tar this soap is for you. It also has a nice citrus note that comes through after being lathered to balance out the heavy darkness of the pine tar. It also have me the excuse to use my First Snow AS. First Snow isn't my favorite scent, but the AS does such a good job of giving you the experience of walking through the woods in the winter. It reminds me of hiking and looking for Christmas trees with my dad.",

Found out he is a vintage shaver and I let him borrow some Declaration Bandwagon and my Maggards Synthetic (he has only ever used Italian Barber and boar brushes). After pointing him towards Maggard's site, he immediately bought the exact things I let him borrow. Yesterday I came home to this tube of CO Bigelow which is produced by proraso. While it isn't the same stuff I use, I appreciate the thoughtfulness and used it last night. It is actually quite good considering it's make-up. I rarely shower shave, but this was very convenient to use. Glad to have someone local that enjoys what I do, even though he is ancient :p",

Jacinthe is very nice, lemon forward scent, with some florals mixing in nicely. I love this brush. Quickly moving up to my top spot, if not already there. B3 hair doesn't get as much love as the other batches, but I must of got lucky to get some of the best of the group. This brush is simply wonderful to use.

It's helping me get through these rainy PNW days while counting down to the kids' spring break at the end of the month when we'll be heading to the beach. The B&M Reserve Cool aftershave was one of the samples that came with my soap order and while I really like it, it kind of overwhelmed the warm, citrusy, beachy notes of the oil and soap. All in all, not a bad way to start the day. Then I went and ran over my toe with the trash can while pushing it out to the curb and when I got back inside, the stupider of our two dogs jumped up on my lap with the 6-year old's watch in his mouth. Bad dog!",

Song: Night of the Living Baseheads](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyR09SP9qdA)\n\n**Prep:** glycerin soap, hot shower\n\n**Brush:** [Stirling 24x51 mm synthetic] (https://www.stirlingsoap.com/collections/shave-brushes/products/synthetic-shave-brush-24mm-x-51mm)\n\n**Soap:** [Storybook Soapworks La Forêt de Liguest](https://trythatsoap.com/collection/515/?product_type=soap)\n\n**Razor:** [Stirling DE3P7S](https://www.stirlingsoap.com/collections/safety-razors/products/stainless-steel-handle-de-razor-de3p67)\n\n**Blade:** [Voskhod Teflon](http://www.tryablade.com/blade/voskhod-teflon-coated)\n\n**Post:** Extra lather, [CL Unscented Balm](https://chatillonlux.com/collections/post-shave-salve/products/unscented-post-shave-salve), [CL La Forêt de Liguest AS](https://trythatsoap.com/collection/515/?product_type=aftershave)\n\nMy musical taste tends more toward classic rock, but having grown up in the 1980's, it is also strongly influenced by classic hip-hop. Today's song was by [Public Enemy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Enemy_(band\\)), the political and self-empowerment firebrands whose first 4 albums where amazing. When thinking of consciousness raising and influential hip-hop acts, PE is at the top of a long list including [KRS-One](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KRS-One), [A Tribe Called Quest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Tribe_Called_Quest) and many others, of politically-charged rap. Shining a bright light on the struggle in the inner-city with drugs, poverty, crime and hopelessness in an effort to make these struggles known to a wider audience.\n\n[Night of the Living Baseheads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_of_the_Living_Baseheads) is a full-throated critique of the [crack-cocaine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crack_epidemic) explosion in the inner cities in the 1980's. Much like the opiod crisis of current time, crack ravaged inner cities tearing apart families and leading to all kinds of crime, death and despair. [Baseheads](https://genius.com/Public-enemy-night-of-the-living-baseheads-lyrics) is PE's treatise of the horrible effects of this nightmare drug.\"Shame on a brother when he dealing | The same block where my 98 be wheeling.\"\n\nFor the shave, I went with SSW and their collaboration with CL. Such great soap, slick, wet, ultra-protective and such a wonderful scent on top of that.\n\nPost shave, CL Balm and finished it off with more La Forêt goodness. This is a strong scent, so I go lightly on the amount of product I use.\n\nLooking forward to the weekend! Have a great day!!!",

So for some reason I tried to do everything with cold water, not a great decision I think. Gave my wife the choice of soap samples between Roam and GLS and she opted for Roam. Shave went pretty well, no bleeding and feels pretty good now as far as irritation down in the neck. I just got in this salve and wanted to try it out, I guess I should have read the CL directions online before trying it, I didn't rub it between my hands to warm it up so it just went on real thick just it the check where I applied it. Lots of rubbing in and it spread out some, but I had to scrape out three more little bits to cover the rest of my face. But it feels great, I do really like this GLS scent.

I'm in the camp that believes Tabac has a place in everyone's den. While the scent isn't my all time favorite, I'll go on record and say it's not bad. The performance of the soap also is decent, you're not going to get the thickest, most pillowy lather from it but it sure is slick. All in all a decent, mass produced soap that all right in my book.\n\n",

These scents are definitely a bit unorthodox and I'm glad I tried the sample first. My untrained nose picked up citrus, clove, mulling spices....yeah, I had no idea what to think at first. I didn't think I'd like shaving with it, since it wasn't the holiday season and, to me, these are definitely holiday smells. But after lathering, the scent opens up and matures, and actually softens a bit. I'm gonna miss this when the sample runs out. I see a full tub in my future.\n\nThe performance of B&C is top notch. Easy to get a creamy lather, retains plenty of moisture, and has a great post feel. If you find a Ballenclaugh scent you like, don't hesitate to get a tub. I don't think you'll be disappointed.",

As [the first paying customer](https://m.imgur.com/HzogmZo) it seemed only proper that I should. Now I know /u/chiseledface ain't gonna make a shit soap, but this *is* a budget soap. Anyway, this may be a budget soap, but that doesn't mean it's a cheap soap (read that as shitty soap). The performance is quite good and lathers easily. But the real bonus is the post shave feel. It is actually quite good, and better than some higher priced soaps.\n\nOff to do errands.",

It seems backwards to me that they wouldn't give the larger raise for loyalty but it allows them to remain cheap I suppose. So now my hourly raise that I get once a year is 20 cents. yippee.

Grabbed the Crown shave cream that I probably haven't touched in 2 years and this tube of Avon Alpha I was given for Xmas and never opened. The Crown made a nice slick lather but a little thin, probably used too much water. The Avon aftershave is basically just lotion but my skin absorbed it fast so I followed it up with the Colbeck splash, love Colbeck. Replaced the Polsilver SI blade with a Feather and got an even better shave from the Guerrilla. And \"Old Thunder\" is always a joy to use, It's a real soap destroyer though.\n\n",

It's just the right length and very well knurled, so I was able to keep a good grip and just the right angle throughout. The Supreme Cream was pretty good once I got the right amount of water in it. I just squeezed some into my left hand and kept wetting and re-applying as needed throughout the shave. I did end up with a pair of nicks on the back of my head. Not life threatening, but a clear indication that my technique needs refinement.",

Considering the tub has been sitting open for months, the scent is pretty mild and it works well with any aftershave I want.\n\nI haven't used the B1 washo in a while since I got my 24mm B4 in. The reduced loft changes things pretty dramatically in my opinion. The B4 is more of a cottonball, while the B1, while not floppy, is more of a paintbrush. I think I prefer the shorter loft but both are so ridiculously soft that I can't complain.",

YRP has now been part of 2 different soap bases, is scheduled to be part of a 3rd, and will be released as a fragrance this spring. /u/hawns, your girl is kind of a sloot. Possibly the biggest sloot in all the wetshaving world. However, I love her and can't wait to see what kind of shenanigans she gets into next.",

Cape Verde has always been one of my favorites as a slightly spicier Lavender scent. Reserve seems to be richer to my nose and slightly sweeter. I think it may depend on the day which scent is my favorite but they are different enough that both will likely end up in the constant rotation. Kept with the F.W. Engels Leader. Think I'll stick with this one for a bit. Finished with Lavanille, which I use anytime the scent is even in the same galaxy that the soap I used was in.",

First time trying out a DG soap and a good performer it was. Scent was great. I did a full face lather for the first time in a few weeks with good results. It felt a little thick on the first pass (likely didn't feed it enough water) but was great through two more. I had a few nicks as sadly is my usual performance, but I really did like the post shave feel of this soap. I did a round of Alum then right to the salve. I rubbed it between my palms to warm and loosen it up at it went on much better tonight, very happy with the way my face feels now.",

There is much talk about two different types of B3 hair due to interbatch differences. I'd say that most likely this brush is a little firmer than my other B3 brushes, but it could be due to this brush being a Jeffo and the others being Teddy's. The brush still performed great and has super great face feel. I may have picked up a tinny bit of scritch on the second pass lather, but it wasn't apparent on the touch up lathers. I do believe this brush has seen some use and is fully broken in. So, ya good brush I have all the Declaration hair grades and wouldn't hesitate to pick up any others should the opportunity present itself (wink, wink).",

I generally find that I get much better slickness with soaps versus creams but this one has a reputation as being one of the best. It definitely was impressive and seemed to truly be richer and fattier feeling than other creams I've used. It was quite slick too. The scent was probably its weakest point--not bad but sort of forgettable. It's always surprising to me that old-school companies don't try to revitalize the product line by introducing some modern scents to accompany a tried and true product. Anyway, it was a very good cream. I managed to mangle my chin just a tad but I am blaming user error and a Feather on shave 3. Happy Sunday!",

At least last weekend when I used it, I finally finished off my bottle of the Proraso crema dopabarba balm. Now I'm going to bundle up and go back to bed. I managed to get what ever sickness my kids have had the last few days. The shower and shave have made me feel half way normal, so I'm going to try to take advantage and get some more rest.\n\n\n\nHave a good one!",

The Pretty Little Wife said it smells \"like the underside of a beaver... but not in a bad way\" and she's not wrong. It is, in my opinion, very musky. Per the manufacturer's recommendation, I used the only synthetic brush I have, which came in a $10 holiday gift set from Trader Joe's. Unfortunately, it has no backbone. Having picked up 1 razor, 1 handle, 3 soaps, and 3 pre-shaves in the last 10 days, I feel like I am on the verge of ordering a new brush (and possibly a full starter kit for a friend) and really cementing my diagnosis of EAD (Everything Acquisition Disorder).\n\nAnyway, I like the Lavanille and the B+M Reserve 'Spice' aftershave was just fine. Of the 3 aftershave samples that came with my soap order, I think I like 'Cool' the best, maybe enough to buy some next time I'm ordering from B+M. 'Spice' came in second, but I don't think I'd pay for it. As for 'Classic'... I just wasn't a fan.\n\nI'll be on my own with the kids for the next few days because the Pretty Little Wife has to go to Detroit for something like 36 hours worth of meetings. But as soon as she gets back, we'll start packing for Spring Break. I'm really hoping I'll be able to scout up some fresh Pimenta racemosa leaves while we're down in our Caribbean paradise because I want to try my hand at making my own bay rum splash. If I get lucky (and none of you rat me out to US CBP), maybe I'll have enough for a mini-PIF.",

It is a beast. Very dense knot compared to my two Thäters. It's taken me a few shaves to get comfortable lathering with but I'm getting there. I like this soap but it has quite a punch to the olfactory out of the tub. In the lather it warms up and the other notes come through nicely. Have a great week everyone!",

I've been using Personna reds for a while, and the underside of my chin was becoming itchy. I went back to my trusty Perma Sharp this morning, and I had a very nice shave. The underside of my chin is feeling great. Of course, the WK soap makes it just about fool proof to have a great shave. I really enjoy this scent too--it's very similar to Clubman, but a touch more sophisticated. Happy Monday everyone!",

This Fern threw me off a bit because it does indeed smell a lot like Clubman - but without whatever that scent is that says \"this is Clubman\". One could argue whether it's a better or worse scent, but it's a lot more...refined I think is the word. It lacks that overwhelming musk bomb that makes Clubman so strong, and ends up just being more subtle overall. Some would argue that Clubman, is a fougere - I'm not one of them. While LFP is a great scent, it just doesn't fit that neatly into the category for me, and I'm looking forward to getting back to the greener scents I've grown accustomed to.\nSide note, the weekend stole an hour from us all and I'm not happy about it. Happy Monday anyway, here's to hoping it's not that bad.",

Nothing fancy. I decided to use my DE since it was already out and ready. I plan to use the Sedef on my next shave with the Derby one more time before swapping it out. I'll probably use Soap Commander's Influence because I like the scent and it's also my 'base' soap - it's repeatable results when I'm testing something.\n\nI posted a comparison yesterday of my Henckels straight (vs the unbranded NY Barber Supply straight). I plan to use the JAH again, I just need to pick up some mineral oil first. I certainly want to prolong the life of my straights, so I want to coat them lightly with mineral oil between uses.\n\nThis morning was cold, so I'm glad I still have my natural scarf (aka beard). Competition is about two weeks away. After that, I'm fully shaving for the summer to give my skin a rest and also to keep it cooler for the hot, humid weather that is around the corner.",

Unless you're a baby goat, there's no reason to drink goat's milk.\n\nFortunately, the brain trust at PETA says nothing about shaving with goat's milk, so I can only assume they'd be 100% and enthusiastically on-board with it, which is a huge relief.\n\nAnd if the goat's milk is pissing off some vegans, they must really be throwing a shit fit about some Tussah Silk. Like the goat's milk, this silk was also stolen -- stolen from moth larvae. That's right, people. Larvae. Babies. We're literally stealing precious silk from babies.\n\nBut what are you gonna do?

Adagio is a fantastic shave every time I love it such a unique scent and so refreshing that little bit of menthol in the splash is the icing on the cake. I am starting to see the ring of death on this tub of Adagio thankfully I have a backup tub! Hope everyone had a great weekend and enjoys their shave today!",

Song: Fight the Power](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PaoLy7PHwk)\n\n**Prep:** glycerin soap, hot shower, DIY pre-shave oil.\n\n**Brush:** [Stirling 24x51 mm synthetic] (https://www.stirlingsoap.com/collections/shave-brushes/products/synthetic-shave-brush-24mm-x-51mm)\n\n**Soap:** [Chiseled Face Summer Storm](https://trythatsoap.com/collection/34/?product_type=soap)\n\n**Razor:** [Stirling DE3P7S](https://www.stirlingsoap.com/collections/safety-razors/products/stainless-steel-handle-de-razor-de3p67)\n\n**Blade:** [Voskhod Teflon](http://www.tryablade.com/blade/voskhod-teflon-coated)\n\n**Post:** Extra lather, [CL Unscented Balm](https://chatillonlux.com/collections/post-shave-salve/products/unscented-post-shave-salve), [Captain's Choice Sandalwood Balm](https://www.westcoastshaving.com/products/captains-choice-sandalwood-shave-balm)\n\nOne more offering from [Public Enemy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Enemy_(band\\)) who I spent alot of time listening to this weekend. [Fight the Power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fight_the_Power_(Public_Enemy_song\\)) was conceived of by [Spike Lee](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000490/) for his seminal film, [Do the Right Thing](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097216/?ref_=nm_knf_i1). This song is really the soundtrack to the film, constantly showing up with great cinematic effect by the awesome character [Radio Raheem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pbfbbuu0q2Y). The song itself speaks to the disenfranchisement, marginalization and [cultural appropriation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_appropriation) experienced by the young, urban population on the hottest day of the year in Brooklyn. It is also a rallying cry to those same youth to not sit back idly but to fight back. Really awesome movie and made even better by an [amazing song](https://genius.com/Public-enemy-fight-the-power-lyrics). \"Our freedom of speech is freedom or death | We got to fight the powers that be\"\n\nFor the shave, I went with my every other day Summer Storm...starting to see some progress but it will be many more weeks before it is kicked. I also put some DIY preshave oil on. Not sure it really helps, but I love the extra softness it provides.\n\nPost shave, CL Balm and finished it off with a some of Captain's Choice Sandalwood balm. Very mild scent, but the protection is fantastic.\n\nStrong start to the week...a week in which we are scheduled to get more snow!!!! Have a great day!!",

Been working on a IPL recipe and today I'll be ordering the supplies and ingredients needed.\n\nShave was great and I was in dire need of one too. Nothing an Astra blade can't do in this razor. Started with a 5 and mowed with the grain, followed two across the grain shaves in each direction with a 4 setting. DFS.\n\nHappy Monday all!",

I used to think my water at home was hard, but it's actually noticeably softer than in Philly. My face was still super slick after rinsing off the lather (also a testament to the bison base. I wonder how Scott's Icarus base improves upon it). B1 hair is amazing as usual, but I definitely forgot how big a Franklin knot is - enough lather for a full body shave, jeez. With me using my Guerrilla and BBS so much in Philly, it's nice to revisit the vintage razors. The I1 injector is as comfortable as ever. Great shave overall.\n\nI left half my den at home for when I come back for break and I think I'm going to be cutting it down (and the one in Philly) as I haven't been shaving as much as before. Not sure whether it's the subconscious affect school has had on me or the waning interest in the hobby. Hell, it could just be me finally figuring out what works best. Either way, I think DFS is going to stay since it's a nice, safe option to use for when I need to shave and eventually start seeing patients \\o/. Gonna enjoy my week off, play a ton of Breath of the Wild, but still study a little so I don't come back stupid.",

I picked up a sample from Shave Dash a few months ago with no expectations and as a last minute addition to my order. I was absolutely impressed with this soap the first time around in terms of slickness. It was one of the slickest soaps I've ever used. The second use again was wonderful. Great slickness, and I enjoyed the scent too. It pairs perfectly with SMdF. It's too bad the cost is high, but it's a top performer. I'd love to pick up a full tub someday.",

The height of luxury this evening. What sort of brush does a brushmaker use? Most of mine are crap ones that I've stuck knots in for testing. I have a pretty nice handle for my Landmark, but it's an early one and doesn't reflect my current ability. Once B4 hit and I had a chance to try it, I knew I wanted something special, so I crafted my ultimate handle and sent it off to Declaration. It arrived yesterday, behold: https://imgur.com/a/dANOm\n\nI'm extremely pleased with the result and I look forward to getting some serious mileage out of this thing.",

There's just too much baggage with its name. It's hard to shake its clean laundry imagery. Its ubiquity, in a sense, holds it back. And in my opinion, people don't *think* they want to smell like lavender even though I know deep down in their heart of hearts they really, really do. Because practically everyone who has come into traditional wetshaving has had a run-in with lavender, it's hard to change those preconceived notions.\n\nIt's kind of the opposite problem that sandalwood and vetiver have. These words just sound sexy, don't they? And particularly if you've never smelled them, hot dog, let's get some of that because I don't know why but that shit sounds hella classy.\n\nAnd then they learn the awful truth.\n\nAll that to say, I think CdL is a good gateway drug to people who think they don't like lavender. It's spicy and different, but familiar, and just wonderful.",

Based on the stated goals by the national organization, I think it was born from a more urban school landscape. But where I've been, it's much more just being there to help the teachers with another pair of hands, helping kids read, etc. They love having a dad there to push them on swings at recess or throw the football for them.\n\nI've done this probably a dozen times now since my oldest started Kindergarten. It's an absolute blast. It also gives me nice insight into classroom dynamics and how my kiddo is doing (is he focused and getting work done? or acting like a crack addled hummingbird trying to nail jello to the closet wall? If I'm being honest, it's probably a little Column A, little Column B.)\n\nGreat program. If you have young kids, I highly recommend trying it once. It means the world to the kids to be the \"big kid on campus\" that day by having dad around.\n\nHave a good day ya'll.",

I chose Teacher's Pet because I have leather scents, and I have lavender scents, but had no apple scented soap, and I chose correctly. It's a crispy, authentic apple on top with a touch of sweetness from the sugar. I get some of the musk and don't get any patchouli, but it's a really well made scent. The base itself was great. It loaded easily, built a fantastic thick, cushiony, stable lather. It had a very nice sheen when hydrated, and my face felt great afterwards. Still need to get it perfect, but I can safely say it easily competes with many veteran soaps out there.\nThanks again to Summer Break Soaps for a chance to try your soap, and I look forward to what you have in store in the future.",

I had tried cleaning it with different methods and overloading it, but it just kept eating and destroying lather, leaving me with one good pass and watery thin subsequent passes. Luckily, I just got in the Brush Rejuvenator from Declaration and at first I was skeptical since it my brushes didn't seem cleaner than my old methods and some still had a touch of ghost fragrances on them. I'm a believer now! If you're having trouble trouble with your brushes not holding lather or giving up lather like they should, then I would definitely recommend it.\n\nAnyway, shave was great and was probably accentuated by now revived boar. I loaded it quite heavy but it also retained a lot more water and I got a great amount of lather. I only have the soap for Bandwagon, so I'm always trying to pair it with something new. LFdL seemed to compliment it quite well and I seemed to get some of the darker notes out of it. As with Bandwagon, I don't have the EdT for LFdL, so I opted to do a different complimentation and went with Bleu.\n\nI think it would have paired up better with Bandwagon, but this wasn't half bad.",

      "body": "Soap: WK Jamestown Gentleman\n\nBrush: Doglaration B4\n\nRazor: Rockwell 6C\n\nBlade: Perma Sharp\n\nPost: Lucky Tiger splash and balm\n\nI picked up a sample of this soap a while ago, and I decided to keep the tobacco train rolling from yesterday. I didn't realize it, but this sample is the old tallow formula, and does not have donkey milk. I've only used WK donkey milk soaps, so it was interesting to compare. First, the scent on this was very mild to the point of almost being non-existent. That seems odd to me given how strongly scented other WK soaps are. Did I get an old sample or a bad batch? Also, it had lots of grainy stearic acid pellets, which is also atypical for WK. But, the slickness was wonderful--just as good a regular WK, which is in the top tier for me. A really excellent shave this morning.\n\nYes, I definitely missed the donkey milk when it came to post shave. It's amazing how much difference one ingredient can make. The donkey milk really takes the post shave over to top. Still, it's an excellent soap even without the donkey milk addition. From my understanding WK is transitioning all soaps to donkey milk, and it's very obvious why.\n\nHappy Wednesday everyone!",

My favourite setting was 2.5 and while I can't remember how it exactly shaved, I remember two things: it was very head heavy and the handle was too short/small/light.\n\nSurprisingly, the Variant is also head heavy - althou the handle is rather long and heavy. In any case, I played around with the setting while doing short strokes on my cheeks and settled here also on 2.5. On 5 the razor has A LOT of blade feel - not sure if it is actually that aggressive, but it feels very aggressive. Even on 2, there is some blade feel and add to that that the razor is very loud, I was a bit worried.\n\nTo make sure, there would be no other issues I whipped up some [fantastic Stirling lather](https://i.imgur.com/mKCyyff.jpg) and loaded a trusted Ladas blade.\n\nFour passes later and I was very impressed. Again the razor feels and sounds aggressive, but at this setting the angle of attack was quiet narrow indicating, that the setting is actually mild. The result was a very nice and close shave - no blood and not irritations - so a great first experience.\n\n\n\n**I hope you all have a wicked Wednesday**",

High near 36. Breezy, with a southwest wind 15 to 20 mph, with gusts as high as 30 mph. Chance of precipitation is 80%. Total daytime snow accumulation of less than one inch possible. High tide at 10:37 tonight.\n\nHoly crap! 4 hours of sleep last night, after I got in from snow blowing for the 2nd time yesterday, had to put my snow gear in the dryer so I could use it at 2:30 this morning to snowblow for the third time in twelve hours, so the wife could get out of the driveway to go to work. We've gotten about 12 inches of snow since this time yesterday morning, and it's just starting to let up. My dad, who is 7 miles inland, got 24 inches. And the bitch of it is this probably isn't the last of the snow for the season. The Small One has another snow day today, bringing the total up to 9 snow days total this year. At this rate she'll be in school until July.\n\nI'm beginning to think that the Nightingale/Catalan's Prairie combo is a jinx for the snow/bad weather. If only they didn't smell so damn good.\n\nHave a nice Wednesday everyone!",

Got this and the Blackfern samples from /u/ItchyPooter (thanks again). I could see one enjoying Black Fern more, as it stands out as more unique, but it's a little 'off' or dark or something for me. Topanga is bright and fun ([duh](https://imagesvc.timeincapp.com/v3/mm/image?url=http%3A%2F%2Fcdn-img.instyle.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F684xflex%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2014%2FWRN%2F091114-danielle-fishel-topanga-594.jpg%3Fitok%3D0e1mBFti&w=700&q=85)) and more my pace. The base itself I think has since been surpassed - it was fine and safe to use, but nothing exceptional about it. I had no matching splash so in a moment of giving in to the hype, I grabbed some VP. Much ragert - I thought the menthol was going to kill me. After 20 seconds of being afraid my face would freeze off my body, it finally settled into a smell that I did not like. Oh well. Hopefully it dies off and this ~~sex~~ 40 Knots shines through and saves the day.\n\nHappy Wednes/Hump/Pi/PI/SA/HYPE-day.",

I'm starting to feel like it needs a name. Like a gunslinger names his wheel gun. I'll have to revisit this.\nBlade: *Persona Blue Platinum*\nBrush: *Maggard 24mm synthetic* this will have to do until my new phandle gets made. But it's not a bad fill in.\n\n-------------\n\nToday is school [walk out day.](https://www.google.com/search?q=school+walk+outs&oq=school+walk+outs&aqs=chrome..69i57j0l3.6343j0j4&client=ms-android-verizon&sourceid=chrome-mobile&ie=UTF-8). You're probably thinking I'm a bit old for High School and you'd be correct.\n\nUnfortunately my agency has decided that the children will have police escorts during their March. So my team has been tasked with \"crowd control\" (which is a gross misspelling of \"babysitting\".)\n\nI actually don't care that they're demonstrating. Good for them for doing something other than retweeting. But where I'm located (urban center) this is going to go from peaceful demonstration to flash mob trying to take the highway.\n\nWhat's really going to piss me off is it's probably gonna go down right when Declaration's SA goes on sale and I'll miss it. Arrgh.\n\nHave a good day ya'll.\n\n\n***Edit: got a tub of the soap before it was gone. Woot!***",

I'm consciously trying to avoid falling down the rabbit hole of searching through all available options and finding out which soap base is the \"Best\". I'm not going to establish metrics. I'm not going to collect data. I do enough of that kind of obsessive nerding in my day job. This is a relaxing activity where I can turn off that analytical part of my brain. I'm going to pick a small and arbitrary collection of inexpensive soaps with pleasant scents and performance that satisfices.\n\nI'm less of a fan of the Limon aftershave. Does not really smell like the soap. Smells somewhat industrial, with a \"pool/hot tub\" chemical feel. It's okay, but I have other citrus aftershave choices that I like better.",

To start with right of the bag I felt the blade was tugging, it had been used a few times. There it thought this might not be a good idea so I changed the blade to a feather. And I got a shave so good that I could not believe it no irritation no red spots and the closet shave. Since then I've been shaving everyday just to test it out which I could never do specially with a feather blade. Tossed the first blade after three shaves, and today was my second shave with the second feather. And wow I'm a truly getting the best shaves of my life.\n\nI've concluded after this past few days that I was just simply over prepping with the hot/ warm water and showering before shaving. Which is crazy to think that was the issue.\n\nWhat do you guys think?",

ATG took a little getting used to, a bit more blade feel and I had to find the right angle for it to shave comfortably, a little less smooth ATG than other modern safety bar razors I've become accustomed to. But, I think this will be a short learning curve. Ultimately, great shave - BBS and no real irritation. I might have nicked myself near the lip a little but only noticed with the alum. A tad bit more feedback from the alum than I'm used to, but again this was my first try on this razor! Compared to the Gillette Tech, the only other vintage I've used, this was a lot better shave - I tend to prefer medium aggressive and the tech is way too mild for me.\n\nPAA Gondolier is one of the better performing soaps I've ever used, dense thick and slick, pretty simple to whip up, thirsty, and vegan.\n\nAstra SP is amazing, it will remain my go to forever, not sure I'll ever reach for a different blade.",

Both products are great. I sold the B&M Lime Lavender and Cedarwood soap on the bazaar because the scent was just meh in soap form. In the aftershave, i feel like the scent is much more nuanced and i sure do love it.\n\nThe brush is great. I really like the knot, but after about 10 shaves it still loses a hair. I'm hoping that stops anytime now. The hairs that it does lose, don't appear to be very long so i am thinking they just did not reach the glue at the bottom. Time will tell.",

I'm going with it. I picked up a sample of this from the Groomatorium a while back, and I enjoyed it a lot on the first use. It's been sitting in my drawer waiting for just such an occasion as this, and I'm glad this gave me an excuse to use it again.\n\nThe Captain is a really nice pipe tobacco scent. I think this is an underrated soap in terms of slickness and ease of lather. I can't recall if /u/Chiseledface changed the formula when he started making Tiki soaps, but I don't think he did. I've not used the original version to compare.\n\nThe post shave is lacking a bit, but it's still perfectly acceptable. I should look into picking up some other Tiki soaps, as I had a wonderful, irritation free shave today. Virgin Island Bay rum is the best bay rum I've smelled, and I think it's because of the addition of a bit of citrus. It's really nice stuff.\n\nHappy Thursday!",

When I try to imagine the scent of an old pirate ship I think of tar, sea water, spice and wood. When I saw the Cat O Nine Tails I couldn't resist. Having the 40 knots around for next week's fragrance Friday was also a pleasant coincidence.\n\nThese themes will definitely promote using scents that I normally wouldn't have in my rotation. It was fun digging through my tub of samples last night and planning this mornings shave.",

Ever since I was a kid I loved everything pirates (even the baseball team just because of their name hah! But I moved to Ohio, so Go Tribe!) and when I would go visit my grandparents they had this old movie on VHS generically called [\"The Pirate Movie\"](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084504/?ref_=fn_tt_tt_28). I would ask to watch that movie every time I visited. It was a parody/homage to the Pirates of Penzance, and it had it all, romance, comedy, music, weird 80's animated bits, funny references to Star Wars and Indiana Jones among others. I actually found it on DVD a couple years ago and now I torture my wife and kids with it! Most recently I binge watched the TV show \"Black Sails\" and then took a vacation to St. Augustine, FL and visited the Pirate Museum. It was amazing!",

After we got underway, the air cooled off, and I strapped my trusty sword, The Hydro-Magic, to my side. Our booty, christened the Blood of Kings, was secure in the hold. We weren't 5 days out of port when the monster attacked. Water everywhere, seafoam making everything slick and white. We fought bravely, with a few crew members perishing. I came forward and after two passes the monster dove beneath the waves, but not before letting my blood. We washed the deck of seafoam and blood, and all of a sudden, a wave of acrid water came from the port side. It was with this wave that I was falling into the sea.\n\nHave a nice Thursday everyone!",

The Zenith, while still relatively new and prone to hoarding lather, is soft and works great. The Wardonia mod is very efficient and comfortable and Roam is interesting. I can see why people say \"old canvas\" from the soap and \"sweet syrup\" for the splash. I could still smell it on my hands 12 hours later which is impressive.\n\nEnjoy your day!",

I'm alright with that as I've grown tired a bit of the same scents over and over, but even sicker of having to load from samples the last 3 shaves. This soap was a perfect choice for the start of March Madness - if it made the tournament it would likely be a 2 and get bounced by a 15...OVER RATED (very similar to yesterday's LASSCo). The smell, however, is absolutely on point. If I had to rank the 9 fougeres I used, well I'm not going to, but at the top would be this, LASSCo Topanga Fougere, B&M Beaudelaire, and WKDM Fougere Bouquet. Numbers 5-9 can moan about not getting into the playoff, but only one or two would have even been in the discussion anyway.\nOn to the shave - it was fine to pretty good. But, for some inexplicable reason, I nicked the side of my nose. Bled like a mother, got out the septic, and yoooooooouch does that ever hurt. Once the ~~cry~~stinging stopped, I carried on and finished and otherwise nice shave with the pleasant Tech. Again, with no true match and wanting to fit into the theme, I reached for the Arrrrrrmada Blossom. Such a nice scent, way too good for a pirate if you ask me.\n\n\nWelp, that about does it. It was a rather enjoyable ride through a scent category that I don't always reach for that often. Even though the Fern Train has arrived at its final destination, the train didn't stop or even slow down enough for me to get off. It actually seemed like it was picking up speed and there appears to be a large cliff coming up. I've got a horrible feeling about this.",

Two Bits is vegan, but quite slick and very easy to lather.\n\nThis is probably the crispest and cleanest smelling profile of any of the barbershops I've tried. It's not very powdery...if at all, but instead it's very fresh, yet not aquatic smelling. Perhaps it could be described as a sharp linen-type scent, but instead of smelling like an terrible candle it consists of barbershop components that work really well together. Either way, I think the soap quality and this particular scent profile are pretty underrated.\n\nThe aftershave is top notch. Same matching great scent that lasts most of the work day. Have a great shave today!",

Song: I'm Shipping Up to Boston](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-64CaD8GXw)\n\n**Prep:** glycerin soap, hot shower, DIY pre-shave oil.\n\n**Brush:** [Stirling 24x51 mm synthetic] (https://www.stirlingsoap.com/collections/shave-brushes/products/synthetic-shave-brush-24mm-x-51mm)\n\n**Soap:** [Chiseled Face Summer Storm](https://trythatsoap.com/collection/34/?product_type=soap)\n\n**Razor:** [Stirling DE3P7S](https://www.stirlingsoap.com/collections/safety-razors/products/stainless-steel-handle-de-razor-de3p67)\n\n**Blade:** [Voskhod Teflon](http://www.tryablade.com/blade/voskhod-teflon-coated)\n\n**Post:** Extra lather, [CL Unscented Balm](https://chatillonlux.com/collections/post-shave-salve/products/unscented-post-shave-salve), [Chiseled Face Summer Storm AS](https://trythatsoap.com/collection/34/?product_type=aftershave)\n\n[The Dropkick Murphys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dropkick_Murphys) are a Celtic/punk band from the Boston area. I could not let the first pirate-themed SOTD go without a serious shoutout to my fellow Bostonians. It is also fitting that Saturday is [St. Patrick's Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Patrick%27s_Day) as the DKM always do a big throwdown in the Boston area over [this weekend](http://www.dropkickmurphys.com/tour/). [I'm Shipping Up to Boston](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%27m_Shipping_Up_to_Boston) is written by folk singer [Woody Gutherie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woody_Guthrie) kicked up with trademarked punk sensibilities by DKM. Many first heard this song prominently featured in [Martin Scorsese's](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000217/) 2006 best picture winner [The Departed](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0407887/?ref_=nm_flmg_dr_18). This was a good movie, but certainly not Scorsese's [best](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099685/?ref_=nm_knf_i2), IMHO. This song must be played at full volume, with 1 or 8 [Guinness'](https://imgur.com/gallery/Rk23F) and a nice [boiled dinner](https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/30918/irish-boiled-dinner-corned-beef/) \"I'm a sailor peg, and I lost my leg! | Climbing up the top sail, I lost my leg!\"\n\nFor the shave, I went with my every other day Summer Storm which also gives a nice pirate/sea vibe\n\nPost shave, CL Balm and finished it off with a some more Summer Storm goodness.\n\nAAARRGGHHH! to all my mateys! Have a great day.",

A spicier and stronger note, who doesn't like rum? The soap performed good, I think I underloaded some because, it was great the first pass but got a little runny in the second and clean up passes, but it worked out fine. I am still enjoying this razor setup, getting very close shaves with much less effort. A few nicks around the chin, but overall very smooth and comfortable. I used the B&M Spice aftershave, and it immediately reminded me of my grandfather, so not so much in the way of sailing ships of yore rather leisure suits in south Florida. Have enjoyed reading everyone's contributions, have a great weekend ahead.",

Some differences, likely due to the water used in its creation, were readily apparent. Older Georgia base puffs into a lather much faster in my hard water. Not that Michigan doesn't also do the same, it just takes a little more work so I'm lathering for 30 seconds instead of 15. The humanity!\n\nNow that spring is peeking around the corner, figured it was time to bust out the BBB for this shave (and no one else had done it yet). This scent is pure awesomesauce, if only it could come back! Hits all the bay rum notes without actually going into the rum. The fruity notes go well with the vanilla and spice hints from sandalwood and cinnamon. Rounds out to a sultry sweet scent that I don't mind wearing all day.",

I use a Muhle XL as a travel brush and just wondered, if the Chubby would be superior. Let me be clear, that I am not a fan of synthetics nor a fan of Chubby style handles - they just feel weird in my hands...so I really didn't want to like the brush. Having said that, it did whip up some [stellar Mike's lather](https://i.imgur.com/oZ8IgqU.jpg) in no time and the face feel was not too soulless. It has a fantastic flow through and in contrast to its badger brethren releases tons of lather with ease.\n\n\n\nWill it replace my badger farm? Definitely not, as I mentioned it feels just too soulless on the face. Is it superior to the Muhle XL? Well I will give it a good try out on my next trip at the end of the month...until then I will be back to badger happiness though.\n\n\n\nBack to the Variant and I went through notes etc to see how it would compare to other razors. It seems like I have grown up a bit. In former times after a good shave with a new razor I would either increase the blade gap (on an adjustable), try a more aggressive blade or on stupid days both.\n\n\n\nWell today I did the opposite and after a really nice shave on 2.5 I tried the razor on 2. This time I zipped over my face in no time and although the razor was still loud and I felt some blade, I knew it would be tame - and so it was.\n\n\n\nThe result was a nice shave with zero issues, but maybe not as close I prefer. I had to clean up a bit at the end. Maybe next time I will go more aggressive after all...\n\n\n\n**I hope you all have a fantastic Friday**",

      "body": "Soap: Beta test for new soap company\n\nBrush: Dogwood Timberwolf\n\nRazor: Rockwell 6C\n\nBlade: Perma Sharp\n\nPost: Proraso Green; Stirling unscented balm\n\nI recently volunteered to do a beta test for a new soap company. I've done several of these in the past, and I've enjoyed giving feedback. This particular soap was well done in terms of slickness. It exceeded my expectations in that regard. The soap was also very easy to lather, and I had no trouble generating a fluffy, slick lather. Where I have found many new soap makers struggle is residual slickness and post shave. The soap didn't feel fatty enough to me after I would rinse between passes. And, the post-shave was lacking because very little fats remained on my face after rinsing. It wasn't a bad soap at all--I actually enjoyed it more than I expected because it is very slick, but we're just spoiled now days by soaps that give you the best in all aspects. When you have post shaves like WK, B&M, Noble Otter, Declaration and others, it's hard to go back. Still, it was an admirable effort by this new company, and I wish them all the best in their new endeavor.\n\nHappy Friday everyone!",

Also the best looking shave I have to date. Still was some irritation when using the alum but the post-shave feel was amazing. Hopefully even better shaves from here on out!\n\nAlso Lebelle soaps are pretty good. I got the soap from the retailer for only $8 shipped for 4 oz tub to my house. I found the soap while using trythatsoap.com and found the vendor on Facebook.\n\nPerfect birthday present to myself to finally get my first good shave! Cheers!",

Knowing that the train was destined for Aetherland, I was more than a little nervous. You see, the tracks get a little dicey around Aetherland; many crashes occur there weekly due to the ham-fisted conductor that works the tracks near there. Sometimes he's got his eye on the switches, and other times he's...preoccupied. Sometimes it's arguing with others over whether or not it was his fault for the previous crash, other times he's ferociously changing the many signature marquees so that no two trains that roll in are greeted with the same landscape. Well, after my luck with the malfunction at the legendarily steady Martin de Candre station, I couldn't help but have the fear. You see though, I'm still here - I did not crash to a fiery death.\n\nI took that brave little brushbutt and went to loading the soap. There was something a little bit off in the scent on the dry puck, and it was touch and go as I began face lathering. Let's get to that lather - this was an incredibly easy soap to lather, building a really dense and protective coat without even trying. Once I got to the stage of adding water to get the consistency right, I was left with nothing but a cooling mint smell and sensation. When it came time to put razor to face, nothing but effortless enjoyment. Protection, slickness, glide - everything you wanted. After the rinse I left my face untreated for a bit to see how the post shave felt. No complaints there either.\n\nAll things considered, the performance was worthy of the accolades. But as we all know, there are so many great soaps out there, the tie breaker usually comes down to the smell. This smell wasn't necessarily for me but it wasn't all that bad. However, I've heard more than one report that there are some legit spoiled batches out there. Just like that conductor who's had some uneventful arrivals, one must remember that is what is *expected* and #neverforget those who ~~spoiled~~ perished.",

Like BSG-Two Bits, Classic is a barbershop that also flys under the radar. I have a soft spot for Classic because it was the first non-Art of Shaving soap I used and I must say it's a great performer because it's Dr. Jon's vol. 2 version. It's unique because the top note is rosemary, which provides a dark, sultry barbershop which isn't what you typically find in this category. Also, lavender is also one it's top notes, which made pairing it with Chatillon Lux-Champs de Lavande really highlight its barbershop uniqueness. That being said, this one isn't really powdery and the bergamot and lime notes still shine through in all their citrusy glory. Have a great shave today!",

I've always wanted to try a sumo style handle and this thing feels fantastic in the hand. The knot is just straight outrageous lol I loved it. Here are some more [pics](https://imgur.com/a/IoZXV) of the brush. Although, I will say this soap sucked eggs. Was slick but wasn't very \"protective\" during the shave. Will probably never use this soap again and just use it to break in some brushes",

I gotta admit, i was a little nervous about getting a knot that big for face shaving, but after using it for a while i gotta say its a real joy to use. Doesn't feel huge on your face and holds soooo much lather.\n\nHappy Friday everyone!",

I'm drawing a blank on the dudes name right now but he did a really good job on the soap and splash. Scent is nice but not a favorite. Nothing wrong with it, I'm just picky when it comes to leather scented products. This one is very nice though. Shares some similarities with Wholly Kaw Cuero Oscuro but sweeter. Antaeus on the other is a beautiful thing. I like old school 80's style frags and this one is perfect. Kind of reminds me of Kouros but not really. Hard to explain. If you like super masculine, power house smells then buy Antaeus.\n",

I swear it seems there is more in the jar than yesterday. Finishing it before April seems unlikely. :-/\n\nYep. I can confirm that shavettes are objects that look like straight razors. The similarity stops there. A real straight is much easier for me to use and much more comfortable. I get a close shave with a shavette, but it isn't as comfortable and I'm more prone to poking myself with the corners of the blade. Maybe I just need more practice. Back to the real straights for now.\n\nWe got a fair amount of icing last night. That should make for interesting driving this morning. Good thing I have 4WD.",

So my project [Icarus](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Mortals/Icarus/icarus.htmldelivery) is stuck in Detroit, MI for the weekend. But like a Phoenix from the Ashes, /u/Brienc23 rises to give hope.\n\nHis generous package chocked full of glorious samples arrived yesterday to tide me over until next week.\n\nSo this morning I sifted through and selected Wholly Kaw DM - Man from Mayfair in an effort to soothe the sting of hubris and melted wings that dropped my SA into ~~the ocean~~ Detroit.\n\nAnd soothe it did. What a phenomenal soap. I have some WK soap that I use regularly, but it's their tallow base. The \"but\" is grammatical only, and not an indication of a defecit.\n\nBut I understand why WK is moving toward DM in more of their bases. Great shave. Great scent.\n\nIn a nod to both Project Icarus and today's impossibly blue sky, we're gonna close out this long-winded SOTD with this [little ditty about the sun.](https://youtu.be/CKh0dLIuIu8)\n\nHave a good day ya'll.",

I was a little hesitate about using a TTO for fear that I might bend/break some part of the TTO mechanism, but I was still interested in trying one because of its weight and rumors of good build quality. One shave in, and so far I'm impressed. The only vintage Gillettes I've tried have been a NEW SC, 40s SS, and Pre and Post War Tech. Out the gates, first try, I think this Rocket might be my favorite. Smooth and efficient 3 pass shave.\n\nAnd the Ballenclaugh Soap, as always, performed wonderfully.\n",

Most days my wife doesn't get to appreciate which soap scent I choose, so I picked something I think she will like. Shave went very well, did a full face lather and it was the best one I have done to date. There was piles of lather whipped up by this fine brush. Very smooth shave, especially around my jawline, bordering on BBS. Have a good rest of the weekend all.",

With Bergamot, Basil, Patchouli, and Oakmoss as the only notes, Barber Shop comes across as more plain/boring than any other version I've tried. It's not my favorite, frankly. The lather is good, although I had some trouble getting it right with Mike's before. I find that Fine-American Blend is one of my favorite aftershaves and even though the ingredients seem sparse, I'm still left with a great feeling and scent afterwards. Will probably pick up the EDT at some point. Have a great shave today!",

Once I started loading, goat became stronger, but once I added enough water, sandalwood became much brighter to me. Goat is negligible now. Strange?

I used unscented post shave products so I didn't have anything that would clash. My left wrist has two sprays of Platinum and my right has the Aventus. The first thing that stood out is that the Platinum is a bit sharp and synthetic with the initial burst of pineapple while the Aventus is more mellow.\n\n**2 hour update:** The Aventus is still going strong while I am already struggling to get a good whiff of the Platinum. The Aventus is sweeter while the Platinum is a bit woodier.\n\n**4 hour update:** The Aventus is still present but only 4-6 inches away. I can only get the faintest traces of the Platinum when I put my nose right next to my skin. Overall a little disappointed in the longevity of the Platinum.\n\n\n**8 hour update:** Not getting any of the Platinum at this point. The Aventus is still hanging around 4-6 inches from the skin. This was with 2 sprays each wrist. Next time I will try using more of the Platinum. For $35 I still think it is a decent deal but some of the other clones may provide more longevity.",

For $1.54 I think it is a pretty good little razor. The metal head is of decent quality and the blade aligned perfectly to my surprise. Definitely the mildest shaver I have; can't wait to see how it does with a Feather. I get so much amusement from trying cheap razors like this. This was the third shave on this Personna Blue. It made it back from my last Canada trip hiding in my carry-on almost a year ago. Not the greatest shave though. There was some irritation on my neck before the shave that was made a little worse. Anyone know if blades can degrade if left sitting for a while? I've been using a piece of my Palmolive stick in my scuttle to bowl lather. It's crazy how many shaves I've gotten out of it. What started as a disk is now the size of a pistachio. Still whips up nicely but doesn't really have a scent anymore. Didn't dissipate with the heat from my scuttle either. Happy Sunday ya'll!",

Time to take my time with a nice, luxurious shave. Unfortunately, I watched one too many lathering videos on YouTube yesterday and decided I'd try hand lathering instead of my usual bowl lathering. I moistened my face and applied my pre-shave and then started trying to build a lather on my hand. Long story short, I got 2 decent passes and a Socially Acceptable Shave. Next time I want to try out a new technique, I'll do a couple practice runs *before* I bring the razor into the picture.\n\nIn other news, they should be dropping lumber on our new home site this week, meaning the clock is ticking on moving house. Want to get the current house in shape to go on the market in May (when the already hot market has historically been hottest). Already got a furnished apartment lined up to cover the gap, and then hopefully move in on the new place in mid-July.\n\nAlso, I just heard a noise downstairs. I think it was a cat. Luckily, the two stupidest french bulldogs in the world are on guard duty, so they immediately sprung into action to protect me from the unseen threat. What would I do without these two fart monsters?",

Stirling's Barbershop is powdery and sweetened with a vanilla that makes it unique. I'm a sucker for vanilla, so this one ranks pretty high. I find Stirling lather to be deceptively good...so much so that I could easily buy only Stirling and probably be happy bc the price per ounce. I only wish the aftershave scent lasted a little longer. Have a great shave today!",

My new boss is starting today, and I have no idea what is going to be in store. I know from past experience to expect some organizational shake up, I just don't know what form it will take, or how quickly he will want to start executing. When I interviewed him he seemed like a sharp guy, with a decent grasp of our problem domain, so we'll see. It's going to be a fun week though.\n\nI had planned out AtR this week for the aquatic pairing with this coming Friday's Xerjoff - JTC: 40 Knots. While not really aquatic itself, it is supposed to go with wet rainy smells, so we'll see. Today I went with one of the few aquatics I really, really like. Blasted Heath is salty seaweed and cold ocean winds with green, earthy and woody elements supporting underneath. No melons here, which it shares in common with the Xerjoff. However this one is much more oceanic, and focuses heavily on the marine element, where as with the Xerjoff it's only one component of a more complex construction.\n\n\n\n\nHave a good one!",

We did get just about all of the trees out of our yard which is nice. The front yard at least. Backyard is this week. Hopefully the snow we are supposed to get tomorrow doesn't knock anymore down.\n\nIn actual bad news, my Beaudelaire is dying. About a nickel sized hole opened up. This is like the third or fourth tub though so after it's gone I'm not going to look for another. It was a great run. Now I just have to hold out hope it comes back as an EdP or something. That would be nice.\n",

The past couple of days using WK soaps have treated me so well that I didn't see any reason to stop. YRP is almost one of my favorite scents of all time, but unfortunately I'm not a big rose fan. My dream soap would be YP without the R. Still, it's very good, and the WK performance is amazing. Happy Monday everyone!",

Cooper & French make a great product and their Authentic Barber is top notch. Described by the artisan as a scent profile with \"powdery Bay Rum, Sandalwood and earthy Patchouli,\" you definitely get powdery and some creaminess and sweetness, too. Not a ton like Stirling, but it feels like there's a little vanilla in the background. C&F's lather is top tier-ish, so I had an excellent shave. The AS Balm is quite nice...a little runnier than a Nivea, but it absorbs quickly and the scent lasts longer than nearly all balms I've tried. Have a great shave today!",

It's been and even longer while since I broke out the Passiflora.

She's got to drive out to meet our builder for 8am and I get to stay home and ensure the kids get to school. Since we're a single car family, that means the kindergartner and I will be Uber-ing to the elementary school and then I'll be Uber-ing on to work. Luckily, there was a 50% off Uber coupon in my email this morning (though the max value is $6 and a rush-hour trip downtown is going to cost closer to $60). We're going to have to get a second car soon, but it's hard to justify when the teenbeast can't seem to get it's drivers license (failed the written once and passed on the second time... 0 for 3 on the road test so far).",

I think up to this point I've only used it on a days growth.\n\nCoolabah is fairly heavy pineapple off the puck. I did apply a very small amount of the aftershave last night and almost immediately a more cologne-y scent came through. Not sure if it was scent fatigue or the actual strength of scent, but the scent was gone after about 30 minutes.\n\nAgain, that was a very small amount applied just to get a whiff of it, so it will be interesting to see how long this one lasts today with a normal shave and normal a/s application.\n\nThe scent itself is in the ballpark of Aventus but also it's own thing. I know APR set out to put their own twist on an Aventus type scent and they've definitely do that. It's got that same kind of vibe going on so that if you're a fan of Aventus you will probably like Coolabah but you've got to go into it expecting it to be different. If you want this to be an exact dupe you're gonna have a bad time.\n\nIn non-shaving news, we've got some insane weather over the next day or two. 60 degrees yesterday, rain showers and 50 degrees today, then changing to snow showers tonight with the potential for ~4 inches of snow. At this point I kind of wish everyone would just get snowed in. I could really use a day to catch up on everything I need to do at work. Speaking of that, we had a guy put in his 2 weeks notice yesterday and surprise, surprise, we're not going to fill his spot because our \"personnel is to high.\" Just means everybody is going to be spread even more thin but I feel like this is a trend at a lot of places lately.",

I didn't pick up any goat funk off of the puck (sorry /u/itchypooter). Instead, I smelled only spicy, woody sandalwood. I've never been a sandalwood fan, but I knew that this would be a top tier product, so I ordered anyway. Mostly, I just wanted to try the new base. The Declaration base is already in the top tier, so my curiosity was piqued to see how this could possibly be improved. Well, it was.\n\nI found the slickness to be pretty similar to the old base, and that's a good thing. Where the product really shines is the post-shave. It's truly impressive. It's probably the best post shave feel of any soap I've ever used. It's not leaps and bounds above that of WK, but after one use I'd say it is slightly better. At this point, though, we're splitting hairs. They are both in the top tier of post-shave performance and simply fantastic products.\n\nThe scent was actually better than I expected, which for someone like me who is not a sandalwood fan I am pleased about. The scent strength of the soap is strong. Most people would like that, but I prefer weaker scents. The scent is spicy, woody, and best of all totally natural smelling. It's just extremely well done. Both collaborators really nailed this one.\n\nHappy Tuesday everyone!",

This is a pretty good scent, but a bit too much menthol for me. It wasn't unbearable or anything, but cooler than I'd like on a freezing morning. At first I didn't think it was very much like Aventus, but then the AS dried down a bit and it got pretty close. I don't believe the artisan set out to create a dupe so I'm not judging his attempt in any way - I was actually excited to see what Aventus would smell like if just constructed slightly differently. The shave definitely kind of went its own way and then once the AS settled down it made for a perfect pairing with the EdT.",

I am really happy with the scent. It's got very spicy \"punch\" to it that I really enjoy.\n\nThe base is fantastic, but that's no surprise given Declaration's usual base. I went in with a very wet brush, on the advice of others. Well even with a ridiculously wet sloppy brush, I didn't over water this soap. Instead, after 20 seconds of lather building in my mug I was met with an absurd amount of lather. \"Mooooom! I put the wrong soap into the dish washer!\" [levels of lather](http://7thhouseontheleft.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/overflowingdishwasher.jpg).\n\nBut it wasn't watery. It was thick and slick and great. Wonderful shave. I don't usually care for balms, I don't like the tacky \" lotion\" feel I get. For that reason I prefer splashes. But the AoS balm is the only sandalwood pairing I have. So it got the nod today. And it's good.\n\nIn other news, back in November during a foot chase a suspect tried to shoot and kill one of the guys I work in the same District Station with. Suspect was eventually caught 3 days later.\n\nWell yesterday he escaped from Sheriff's Deputies during a transport from the hospital. So, I guess it's time to get my inner [Sam Gerrard](http://www.monologuedb.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Tommy-Lee-Jones-as-Deputy-Samuel-Gerard-in-The-Fugitive.jpg) on. It's man hunt time.\n\nHappy Tuesday ya'll.",

Wholly Kaw's Man From Mayfair definitely performs like a top 2 or 3 in this list as its performance is rarely challenged. The scent profile is powdery and sweet, but not quite at the level as both C&F's Authentic Barber, or Stirling's Barbershop. Mayfair's accord includes musk, lavender and basil, which makes for a rather intoxicating mixture that feels complex instead of straightforward like some players in this category. Mayfair reminds me of Declaration Grooming 's Bandwagon, which I was a little underwhelmed by, but this kicks it up a notch in the right places and just works more favorably to my nose.

Naturally, the kid wanted to smell every tub I opened and it really liked the Taylor of Old Bond Street sandalwood shave cream, so that's the one I left on my sink to use this morning. Compared to the soaps I've been using recently, ToOBS shave cream was like lathering on easy mode. I did three slow-and-steady passes and you can call me Kvothe because I didn't nick, slice, or otherwise mangle any of the odd protuberances on my noggin. I go to work this morning with my gleaming scalp solidly in DFS (if not BBS) territory. I probably won't re-razor my head until the end of the week or weekend, but I'm thinking I might like to try the Maggard MRT handle with the AS-D2 head.\n\nAlso, I have solid meetings from 10 to 4:30 today.

Been wanting to try one of these. Very similar to a V3A. Perhaps a tad more aggressive. For the price it's a solid DE. The cons are the plating. It feels pretty cheap feeling. Handle is too short. The blade can become misaligned when assembled. But it's priced really low and made of solid metal. It's been wet around here so Perichor fits nicely.",

      "body": "\"Pancho and Lefty\" SOTD\n\n**Song:** [Artist: Merle Haggard and Willie Nelson. Song: Pancho and Lefty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iloyyrVt7EM)\n\n**Prep:** glycerin soap, hot shower.\n\n**Brush:** [Stirling 24x51 mm synthetic] (https://www.stirlingsoap.com/collections/shave-brushes/products/synthetic-shave-brush-24mm-x-51mm)\n\n**Soap:** [Noble Otter Nectar Amissa](https://trythatsoap.com/collection/852/?product_type=soap)\n\n**Razor:** [Stirling DE3P7S](https://www.stirlingsoap.com/collections/safety-razors/products/stainless-steel-handle-de-razor-de3p67)\n\n**Blade:** [Polsilver Super Iridium](http://www.tryablade.com/blade/polsilver-super-iridium)\n\n**Post:** Extra lather, [CL Unscented Balm](https://chatillonlux.com/collections/post-shave-salve/products/unscented-post-shave-salve), [Noble Otter Nectar Amissa AS](https://trythatsoap.com/collection/852/?product_type=aftershave)\n\n[Willie Nelson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willie_Nelson) is a true American icon. He is often parodied for his prodigious [ganja use](https://williesreserve.com/) but he is a legit singer, songwriter and performer who still hits the road for over [200 shows](http://willienelson.com/tour/) per year. I've seen Willie in concert many times over the years, as well as walked by his legendary [biodiesel fueled tour bus](http://money.cnn.com/2007/09/26/news/newsmakers/willie_nelson/) with its heady scent combo of hemp and french fries.\n\n[Pancho and Lefty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancho_and_Lefty) was written by [Townes Van Zandt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Townes_Van_Zandt) telling the tragically heroic tale of 2 characters, Pancho and the enigmatic Lefty. Willie and [Merle Haggard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merle_Haggard) covered this fantastic tale on their [1983 honkytonk album of the same name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancho_%26_Lefty_(album\\)). \"Pancho needs your prayers it's true | But save a few for Lefty too\"\n\nFor the shave, I tried this Noble Otter offering I got in a \"Take 2/Leave 2\" offering organized by /u/ahjoyc2/. I have never tried Noble Otter, so I took it slow, building a nice base by slowly adding water and whipping it up on my face. I absolutely love the scent combos, getting strong tea,bergamot and patchouli profiles. I couldn't get the lather really going, which is fairly typical for me when trying a new soap, but it was soft, slick and luxurious. I will experiment with the water a little and see if I can really kick it up a notch.\n\nPost shave, CL Balm and finished it off with more Nectar Amissa goodness. The protection is nice and the scent lasted 1-2 hours,\n\nOne other note which I have seen suggested by other shavers...I tried a new blade for the first time in months and I loved it! I got a sampler that included the Polsilver. I understand it is being produced again so I may buy some and give it shot. If nothing else, trying a new blade gives you the opportunity to see if your \"tried and true\" blade is living up to billing.\n\nHave a great day!",

It's my spring break so a little later start before heading to school to get a little research work done. This set was courtesy of /u/Devilsmaycry1974 who included it when I purchased this brush from him a little while back. Even with 450 fragrances on offer at VY, he was able to commission a custom blend of rosemary and peppermint that was pretty pleasant once whipped up. This soap performed very admirably, it claims to be unique in its blend of \"glycerin for humidity and the saponified oils of old fashion [shaving] soap.\" I am no expert to be able to judge but it lathered very well, gave me great slickness during the shave, and left me with some decent post-shave moisturization. The splash had a tiny bite that lasted only for a short while, but also provided a face I am happy with this morning.",

I'm the biggest baby when it comes to getting sick. What's nice about calling off sick today is that school is closed because of the snowstorm and the wife will get to work from home, so it's kinda of like a family day.\n\nI used SA for the second time today and was able to achieve a much better lather out of the soap. I think I skipped the most basic part of lathering shave soap the last time, if it doesn't look right, add more water! Performance was awesome nice thick lather, slick, protective and my face feels very nice after the shave\n\nMake it a great day guys.",

Been awhile since I used Nuavia and it was only once so I didn't have much of an opinion of it. The scent on this initially was really really nice, which is my only lasting impression of Verde. As the shave went on, it got almost muddled into a really generic and strong 'cologne' scent. I'm not sure how to describe it other than it just smelled like a cologne. I think if the scent strength were turned down a couple notches, I'd have liked it better - which is odd for me because I usually want all the smellz. Anyway, soap performed fine. Nothing mind blowing yet still flawless. It would be firmly upper second tier/lowest first for me. If I were a one (or a few) soap man, I believe my soap of choice would be Nuavia just based on scent quality, presentation, and performance.\nIt's still cold, snow on the ground, and it's humpday - blech. But at least I got decent sleep last night, work's a bit calmed down at the moment, and I'm feeling alright.",

Fifty-seven point one grams is the empty weight of the jar according to the spec sheet there. My ~~cocaine dealer~~ digital scale, my jar weighs 75 grams. I got about 18 grams of soap left.\n\nAnd after this morning's shave, 74 grams. Dammit. I can't all be using the same soap 19 days in a row like some kind of Gillette goo-using plebeian.\n",

I've never had much luck with vintage razors, and he's determined to change that and convert me to the vintage camp! To my surprise, I had a very nice shave with this razor today. It felt a bit scrapey at times, but that's probably due to my trying to find the correct angle more than anything. It was actually a very easy to use razor, and my face feels smooth and happy today. I might just become a vintage razor convert yet!\n\nVery nice performance and scent from Mike's coconut too. Great, natural coconut smell that is just the right strength. Slick lather and decent post-shave. Not a bad way to start the day on a snowy day here. Happy Wednesday everyone!",

I had some RSUs vest on the 15th and the proceeds were supposed to go into my bank account via EFT. So imagine my surprise when I got home yesterday and found an envelope from Morgan Stanley in the mail. I figured it was a paper record of the transaction and almost threw it away unopened. Turns out it was a check for the full amount. Now I get to wait an extra week to get my money because the bank puts an automatic hold on any check deposit over $1k. *sigh* First World Problems, I know. Didn't stop me from ordering a basket full of samples from Maggard. Looking forward to trying out some new scents and different soapmakers.\n\nOne week from tonight, I put the whole famn damily in the car and drive down to the airport for the midnight flight out for spring break at the beach. The wife's already packed 3 bags (including 1 rollerboard) to exactly 50 lbs each. I've never seen anyone get a rollerboard (roll aboard? there seems to be some disagreement over terminology there) to 50 lbs, but she did it. Haven't packed a single stitch of my own clothing, though.\n\nAnyway, supposed to rain today so be safe out there.",

It did feel a bit handle heavy, but I didn't mint that. Very good grip, and made for a helluva pic!\n\nHappy shaves to all!",

Results were a BBS shave with 0 irritation on either side. Giving the upper hand to the Astra as it was a little smoother and just as effective for me, plus a good bit cheaper. Also second time using the Simpson Chubby 2 was a joy. Definitely can tell the game scent is starting to wear off.",

Been a long while since I used this soap, and that's kinda a shame. Excellent lather, and a pleasant smell. Big reason I don't use it anymore is that it reminds my wife of her mom, who passed away this last September. It's my Friday, and I am transferring to another plant to support their outage. Probably gonna be on nights, so my shave routine will get jacked. Oh well, y'all have a nice day.",

I don't like leather, dirt, or smoke generally, and I only really had one choice in my den: a sample of MLSW Unforgiven. I really like the performance of MLSW soaps, so it wasn't too much of a sacrifice :)\n\nOf all the soaps I've used in this genre, Unforgiven is probably my favorite. The birch tar comes through, but it's a relatively mild scent given the birch tar and other smoky/dirty scents in the soap.\n\nThanks again to /u/Falcons1583 for the chance to use this razor. Another good shave today with a vintage razor! It was smoother than the NEW long comb I used yesterday and not as scrapey. I have a spot on my neck that is a bit rough, but I'm chalking that up to user error. Again, my face feels smooth and happy, and it was a good experience.\n\nHappy Thursday everyone!

My contribution to today's theme. I really like the sweet notes in this scent. (Plus I figured lots of other folks would be choosing Roam). I'm on stop 3 of my blade sampler, my plan is to do 3x shaves on each new blade on V2/V3A heads in some combo to see if I can notice a difference.

Fenney Tally-Ho\n* **Post:** MLS - Unforgiven\n* **Frag:** Xerjoff 40 Knots\n\nGreat shave with Unforgiven. The Tally-Ho bit me once on the corner on my cheek. I was trying to go a bit too fast I think.\n\nI love Westerns, probably just as much as pirates. When I was a kid whenever we traveled anywhere my dad would put in a Louis L'Amour book on tape and I was a big fan of the Terrance Hill western comedy movies, [My Name is Nobody](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0070215/) trilogy. My love for westerns grew from there with the Clint Eastwood movies, my favorite early on was [The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0060196/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_48) and later on [Unforgiven](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0105695/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_13). And then my favorite western flick of all time came out [Tombstone](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108358/?ref_=nv_sr_1), which I've been lucky enough to visit Tombstone a couple times since my dad lives in nearby Tucson. So neat to see the still bullet riddled Bird Cage Theatre, O.K. Corral, and read the tombstones in Boot Hill. Most recently I watched the [Godless](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt5516154/) mini-series and it was excellent. They don't make too many good westerns these days.",

Good enough for me.\n\nThis is my first time using a boar brush, and my first time using anything other than a synthetic. Holy shit, do you have to load this much soap every time?! My arm is fucking *tired.* Overall, I really liked it. The scrub that isn't there in synthetics was very much enjoyed, and the decent backbone while still splaying a bit better than the tuxedo knot was a welcome change. I like to think I've built up quite the endurance with my right hand, but loading enough soap to form a lather was rough.\n\nIt's my Friday. Thank god for that.",

I love GTB anyway, and when I think of a Western Barber, I'm always taken back to the Doc Holiday scene from *Tombstone* above.\n\nThis morning I'm again reminded of how there area few pivotal moments in our life where a decision has drastic impact on the direction of our life.\n\nWhen I was 18 I spent a few weeks riding through the mountains of New Mexico on horseback. We packed everything on the horses, camped each night, and cooked on a small camping stove. It's still some of the fondest memories I have.\n\nWhen we rode back to town, our guide was inexplicably impressed with me and offered me a job as a horsehand on the ranch. I told him I'd have to think about it, because I lived 700 miles away. He told me it was a standing offer and gave me his number.\n\nI went home and thought about it. I didn't have any concrete plans for the future. I hadn't yet met Dr. Gordon, [which would be another \"fork-in-the-road\" moment](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/82gezh/pifsummer_break_soaps_turn_to_give_back/dvb2168/) that would ultimately set me on the path to where I am today.\n\nSo I thought seriously about moving out West to be a cowboy. Ultimately I didn't take the job. But when I think back on that decision I wonder what life would have been like. Moved out west, learned ranching and horses. I'd probably be somewhere in Wyoming right now, working a ranch or something.\n\nI'm not sure life would be better, simpler maybe, definitely different. In honor of what could have been, let's close this theme out with a little [Toby Keith - *I should have been a cowboy*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aIq1LvzSLsk).",

I'd say this is entering a Western era General Store where the air is filled with Booze, Chocolate, Spices and Sweet Tobacco. I believe I'm one of the few who enjoy this soap. The razor's poor build quality is what I'd expect in the western era. Function over beauty. And a boar brush because I'm guessing that boar was more available than badger. Synth hair hadn't been invented. I suppose I could have also chosen a horse hair brush if I had one. Okay that was fun!",

Knowing that was going to take some time, this SOTD was done last night (though I hadn't shaved/touched up in a couple of days).\n\nFirst, I trimmed the beard to a razor useable length. I than decided on Influence because of its tobacco scent, which I link to a wild west card game, for whatever reason. This was my first full shave in about 6 months. I did a two pass shave with the Sledgehammer. It was very smooth and my technique hasn't suffered by all appearances.\n\nI have to admit that the Omega brush is a great brush. It helped act as an exfoliant and gave me enough lather for 3+ passes (though I only did two).\n\nSo how do I feel after having shorn my entire face? Different. I didn't recognize myself. It still seems strange to look in the mirror. I did have a small rash along my neckline that doesn't seem as \"angry\" today, so it seems shaving wasn't the worst thing to do - it should allow my skin to heal properly. I had noticed some increased itching with the beard from where it's been warmer and I've been working outside more (sweating). I think I ended up with a mild case 'beard rash', even though I washed/balm/oiled regularly.\n\nSo will I be growing my beard back out? Probably. I'm going to get the rash cleared up and then decide when to grow it back. I'll definitely be doing it for fall/winter, just haven't decided about the summer yet.",

I need a few days of the great master and American icon so I will probably listen to more Willie tomorrow. [My Heros Have...](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Heroes_Have_Always_Been_Cowboys_(song\\)) is such a poignant and heartfelt ode to an earlier era and such an appropriate song for a Western-themed shave. I am torn between [Waylon Jenning's version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMv2wTOLnlc) and Willie's so I listened to both on loop! \"My heroes have always been cowboys | And they still are, it seems\"\n\nFor the shave, I needed some good old fashioned leather, and Cuir et Épices fit the bill. Such a strong and manly smell and the L&L soap is fantastic, slick and rich with amazing protection and very little effort to whip up into a nice thick lather.\n\nPost shave, CL Balm and finished it off with more leathery goodness courtesy of Cuir et Épices. This is a strong scent so I only used a few drops so as to not overpower my office.\n\nHave a great day!!",

The sweet, warm tobacco scent of the Smolder made for a good man in black. Following, Taylor of Old Bond Street's sandalwood stood in for the sandalwood grips of Roland's widowmakers. The vintage razor might have helped me remember the face of my father, but he's an electric shaver, as were my grandfather and great-grandfather (at least in the years when I knew them).\n\nI'm not off to conquer the Dark Tower today, but the teenbeast is taking it's road test for the fourth time (in the rain) and I'm dialing into a weekly staff meeting in Luxembourg to listen in on a relevant discussion and introduce myself as the newly minted manager of the software dev team. Any minute now, the Echo Dot in the kindergartner's room is going to start playing the soundtrack from Frozen and she's going to be up here just a few minutes after that expecting toaster waffles, so I'd better quit typing and get toasting.\n\nBe safe out there.",

The scent is a bit light but all the scents come together nicely (Black Peppercorn, Leather, Patchouli, Musk, Citrus). I was happy with the price too, only $10 for the 4.5 oz tub.\n\nI have been really liking the Merkur slant, it isn't as aggressive as I usually like my razors but it's efficient enough I'm not having to go over spots continuously.",

Oh well.\nToday I went with the stainless General, now I can do a back to back comparison. I've used similarly performing soaps to keep the playing field level. In my honest opinion, I think the brass version is a touch smoother than the stainless. It feels like there is a little more blade exposure with the stainless model. I don't think this feel leaves me with a closer shave either. Mind it's still a fantastic, smooth shave, but just a *tiny bit* less smooth than the brass version.\nAnyhow, fantastic shave today despite it raining here, which is not common.\n\nHappy Thursday everyone!\n=)",

My skin has been dry lately and my shaves haven't been as comfortable, so I thought I would try something different. The water was also lukewarm to cool so I'm hoping this combination will help. As far as the soap, it's still there. I still think it only has a 1 or 2 shaves left but we'll see.\n\nAlso in that mail call was a bottle of Witchy Woman body lotion for my wife for our upcoming anniversary. Now I just need to keep it hidden until then.",

It felt a little tugging today. If I find the time this weekend, I'll polish the edges of a couple of razors.\n\nOff to do Friday.",

I forgot how easy to lather this stuff is. The lather just exploded without any effort. It's quite slick too. The post shave is a bit lacking, but I use a balm so no issues there. I like the scent as well. Some classics I can't understand why they're still around, but Cella is one that I can see why it has stood the test of time.\n\nThanks again to /u/Falcons1583 for letting me borrow yet another very cool vintage Gillette razor. This one is made in England, and is a real beauty. It was smooth and efficient. Another good shave this morning with a vintage Gillette. He's really doing his best to convert me to the vintage camp.\n\nHappy Friday everyone!",

Everytime I added water and scrubbed the lather grew. I kept adding more and I don't think I came close to it's limit. With a 30 second load I had enough lather for 3 passes and probably 2-3 more if I wanted. My face is tingling a bit but I think that is from all the scrubbing.\n\nThe toner formula worked great. Definitely feels less tacky than the previous formula. Added the balm on the way out the door because my cubicle has felt like a dry wasteland this past week. Looking forward to ordering the parfum to my next order",

Because I'm a weirdo and weigh my soap tub before and after to see how much I got left and how much longer I have to go, I made an important sciencey discovery today in the Shave Lab. It's a single data point, sure, but I'm hopeful we can build upon this and get down to killing this soap even faster.\n\nSo the weight from before this shave was 1 gram lighter than when I weighed it AFTER my last shave. So instead of using a scant single gram of soap after the last shave, as it turns out I used two.\n\nIs it possible that my shave actually uses 2 grams of soap and also deposits 1 gram of water?\n\nThe tub also registered a single gram less on today's shave.\n\nThe entire scientist team in the Shave Lab here at Pooter Industries is hopeful and cautiously optimistic that this could mean that Lavanille has only about 10 shaves left rather than the initial calculations of 20.\n\n[SCIENCE!](https://youtu.be/nMWGXt979yg)",

Shipped on 3/3, it disappeared completely between 3/8 and only resurfaced on the 18th. Damaged. Which meant I lost the a/s :(\n\nI quite enjoyed my shave. Xocolatl is a heavy \"Spicy\" chocolate scent and the Oleo base lathers up quite well. This is my first Oleo soap and I was quite pleased with it. The balm is also fantastic, absorbs quickly and doesn't leave your face feeling sticky. Scent again is quite strong. overall, quite pleased with this set. Only wish the a/s had survived.",

For every [Whiskey River](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0k9SjMpAxRM) or [Night Life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDc-9yRc5Jg) or even his duet with Snoop Dogg [Roll Me Up and Smoke Me When I Die](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn-AB78kvvE), there is also a [Family Bible](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yde7Bu9lVes) or the old timey [Stand by Me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWa9VWYHyV4). Only someone with the gravitas and authenticy of Willie could stand in front of 100,000 people at Woodstock and sing old timey gospel songs and make it look so fucking cool! \"Will the circle be unbroken | By and by, lord, by and by | There's a better home a-waiting | In the sky, lord, in the sky\"\n\nFor the shave, back on the every other day Summer Storm.\n\nPost shave, went with Nivea just to shake it up and finished it off with what is quickly becoming my fave CL scent, La Quatrième Ville.\n\nHappy it's the weekend! Have a great day!!!",

I'm typically not a SB type of guy, but I must say this razor was fantastic. Paired up with the crazy lather I got from the Reserve this shave was off the charts. I even got the sniff of approval from the wife which is always a good thing. However, there were alternative motives to me using lavender today. You see, Declaration and CL have a release on 4/6 and one of the scents just happens to be....lavender.",

This is a soap that doesn't get mentioned much around here. It's a good soap and I enjoy using it, but to be fair, there are newer bases that have out paced this. I have to load this soap a little longer than some of my other soaps. That isn't a slam on this soap, however. I'll likely always have a tub of TTFFC on hand.\n\nA really lazy start to a Saturday morning.",

People are right when they say it's really thirsty, but it makes a damn good lather.\n\nGotta take a practice NBME test today, so I'm gonna lose like 5 hours of my weekend to that (that's only half an actual exam, too), so I'm treating myself to dinner and boba tonight.

I went with the Un Jour Gris because it was a gray and rainy morning. I really like the scent on this one and it was nice and slick for the first pass. Unfortunately, while I was shaving my first pass, the lather seemed to break down in the bowl. Not sure if I over watered, under loaded, or it just doesn't have a lot of staying power (because it does take me a while to complete a full pass on my head). I did notice, while test lathering the Purple Grapefruit last night, that there's definitely a point where a few extra drops of water took it from slick, voluminous, and very cushiony to still slick and voluminous but not nearly as cushiony... so maybe I went too far with the water this morning. At any rate, I managed to squeeze a fair amount of unbroken lather out of the brush and get myself through to a nice clean head shave. I'm pretty impressed with the new brush. And while I though I'd prefer the shorter handle on the AS-D2 for a head shave (I certainly did with the EJ DE89 head), I think I might want to go back to the full-length handle next time.\n\nIn unrelated news, gotta do laundry today because we're leaving at midnight on Wednesday for Spring Break. My Feather Popular TTO has been living at our condo, but I'm thinking it may be time to bring it home so I can loan it to a buddy who's thinking of giving wet shaving a try.",

A little rushed, but good overall. This blade and head combo is working pretty well. I got a single nick on my chin when I wasn't paying attention. Lather was great, I loaded a bit more starting with a slightly wetter brush and the face lather went great with plenty of suds for 3 passes.\n\nEdit: spellings",

I have been mulling over selling my Timeless bronze, but after this morning's shave, I going to keep it. I like more efficient razors since I try to get it done in two passes with clean-up pass if necessary. My china-doll skin (mainly a couple of spots on my neck) likes it that way! LMAO Anyhow, after the first pass, I checked my work and I probably got 90% + of the growth. Brain said, \"keep it\".\n\nAnd yes, /u/Old_Hiker, that is a boar brush you see listed in my SOTD. I don't dislike boar brushes, but my luck is ass when it comes to them. I used to preach the Semogue news, but after one of them molted (610) and another one stayed in a \"corn broom like state\" (1305), I stayed away from them for a bit. I picked up this Omega on one of my Maggard orders and I really like it. Gets better and better after each use. Great Sunday shaves to all.",

I have said it before, I will never accuse WMS of being a great soap, but it's possible to get pretty good shaves with it if you can get it figured out. That's what I got from it today. I don't fault anyone that doesn't want to bother with it. It does take more effort than any other soap I own. This is the only soap I have ever bloomed, but today I started with a bone dry puck. Something few people know about WMS is that it really is a slick soap. No shit. It really is if you get it right. The biggest drawback for me is how drying it is to my skin. I have to apply the OoO twice because it is that drying. It seems silly to use it when I have much better performing soaps. I just like to use it to show myself that I still know how to get the most out of it.",

I pulled the 40033 out of the back of my cabinet and went with a boar today. I have been using synthetic and badger brushes for a very long time and I felt like I was a little bit out of practice using a boar brush. To my surprise I had no trouble loading the boar brush at all. The size of this brush is very small. I wish the handle were bigger. However, despite the very small size of handle this little brush is a lather monster.\n\nI have used it several times in the past and also soaking to try to improve the softness. It's fairly soft at this point, however, I still felt a little bit of prickliness from the bristles. I think I'm just spoiled from using soft synthetic brushes as well as my Declaration brushes. Overall I actually really enjoyed using it. I should definitely get it out more as it was not nearly as hard to use as I had recalled and lathers like a champ.\n\nAfter a few uses I'm also still really enjoying the scent and performance on the new formula of Black Fern. /u/Chiseledface really did a spectacular job improving what was already a good product. The sickness and post shave are much better.\n\nHappy Sunday everyone!",

It's quite powdery with a citrus top note and some have suggested it could fall in the barbershop category, so I'm tacking it on the end of my 10 days. As noted with Reserve Cool, the lather is second to none. The aftershave is awesome and easy to match with other citrus-centric soaps. Added some Allure Homme Sport from Channel to bump up the senses a little. Have a great shave today!",

I've been running the same set up with different soaps and splashes for at least two months now. But.... I pulled the trigger on some [straight razors](http://www.reactiongifs.com/r/osh.gif). They'll be here this week. Finally jumped into that pool. So that should add some spice to my mornings.\n\nTried Nekromantik for the first time this morning. Usual outstanding SW performance. Very interesting scent. I think I like Lycanthropy a little better, but Nekro is pretty great.\n\nHave a good Sunday ya'll.",

I figured Sunday morning while the whole family was sleeping would be the perfect opportunity. So of course the kindergartner shows up in the middle of my first pass and asks if she can use the razor on my face. I explained why that would be a bad idea, but told her that she could paint the lather on for my next pass. This seemed to suit her just fine and after a few sloppy slaps with the brush, she got bored and wandered off to find breakfast.\n\nI'm not sure what the right approach with sample aftershaves is when they come in little spray bottles, so I just unscrewed the top and dumped a little in my hand like I would if I had an actual bottle. It amazed me how much more complex the scent was on the AS than the soap. There was a not unpleasant alcohol hit when it hit my cheeks and almost instantly I was enveloped in a scent that was *very* familiar. It brought on a minor wave of nostalgia, and yet I couldn't quite put my finger on what it was. I have finally decided that it's the smell of [Sqecial Media](http://www.kentucky.com/news/local/news-columns-blogs/tom-eblen/article142251904.html) back in Lexington. It's not a scent I want to bask in every day, but it's nice. It's been about 40 minutes since I splashed and the musky top notes have mellowed out to a more solid vanilla.\n\nAlso, that Maggard synthetic held a lot more water than I realized. Gotta keep that in mind going forward.\n",

First time using these Crystal blades and they are very nice! I compare them to Vokshod without the initial shave break in period. I always feel like Vokshod are too sharp the first two shaves.",

I really like this scent of this soap because it has a unique creaminess to it that really smells great to me. I don't know what scents were combined to cause this as the scent notes are lemon, rosemary and oakmoss. But, it's great. The performance really works for me too. It's slick and the post-shave is wonderful. My face is very happy and smooth this morning. Can't ask for a better start to the week.",

Had planned on changing the oil in the mowers and doing some yard work, but it's not looking good for that today. Ultrasound is at 3 today and it looks like it's about to rain, so the outside stuff may need to take a backseat. Also need to run a massive amount of stuff to the post office.\n\nThis is my 2nd or 3rd go with Shaken and man is it good. Colbeck fits the bill nicely but I just had to pick up some of that shaken splash (toner?) to go with it. I really wish the EdP had been in stock last night too.\n\nThese Dorco blades came as a freebie, and hey the packaging is nice, so I figured I'd give them a try at least once.\n\nOh and I never was very good at math but Dogwood + Tide Pods + B4 = glorious",

A pretty good shave, first time with this blade in the V2 head, not too shabby. At the time I thought I had tore up my chin area but throughout the day it hasn't hurt that much. The soap was fantastic, I really have gotten better at face lathering using this syn brush. Probably the consistency is a little tacky in the first pass, but plenty of lather after wetting my face between passes (but not too much) for two more. Have a great week.",

Last night was full of house shopping for me. Was able to look at a house I really liked again but happened to see some water marks on the ceiling on the second trip around. Was oddly in the closet only. Hoping the owner fixed this properly before I decide to make an offer.\n\nThis house hunting thing sure is a boar. The first look is like love at first sight and the second go around always finds some issues that shy me away as a buyer due to possible significant costs. I always thought to myself nothing could be worse than my undergraduate degree, however life keeps finding things to challenge that. But, all of the troubles are worth it in the end.\n\nIf any of you have some house hunting and things to look at advice I am more than open to some suggestions! Thanks!",

And it's been a spell since I used any of Sammy's soap. This wasn't a particularly popular scent, but I like it every now and then.\n\nThis brush here is one of my better badgers. Plenty of backbone and soft tips. I debated so long about getting this knot and now it seems like a no brainer.\n\nMy safety razors are going to pack their shit and walk out on me. The only time I have used any over the past four months was when I was traveling in January for a few days. I'm not sure if I'll use any safety razors anytime soon either.\n\nOff to do it.",

I always seem to forget how good LGC smells until I splash some on. Was running a bit late so Bon Berger was an easy choice. Loads and lathers as easily as MdC bit with a better post shave. Seems like this one is hard to find now. The regular soaps without the Ass Milk are still available though. Think I'll eventually grab the Cedar Mandarin one.\n\nAlso fuck buying a house. We put an offer on one that my wife loved. Only to learn they simply wanted to use our offer to push along a different one. F that noise. Pulled the offer last night. Found another that needs a little work but it's a much better school system and neighborhood. And it's a lot less expensive. Hopefully that comes through.\n",

I noticed that it has a little bit of a ring but I wonder if it's misleading judging by the shape of the bowl. It looks to have a little over an 1/8 of an inch on the side from what I can see.\n\nAlso, has anyone gotten new Personna Lab Blues lately? For some reason I was curious about getting some but recent reviews on Amazon are showing less that they've really changed. I know they changed their packaging some years ago but I don't want to buy a 100 pack just to see. I'll maybe get some from tryablade.",

Even though it's pricey, I rotate so much and go through things so slowly that I look more at gross cost than price per ounce - an ounce of the cream and 25ml of splash ran (read lifetime supply) around $40-45 for the set. Performance was really good on the cream but to be honest it really made me thankful for our American artisans in terms of how great a performance we can get for the cost. Using MdC and Nuavia in the last week or so began forming that opinion and then SMN kind of brought it home. Absolutely no gripes or regrets about buying SMN, as it's a really great product and smell, and it feels good to get the real article rather than a dupe. Oh, and the menthol is on point. Enough rambling from me, enjoy your shaves and Tuesdays everybody.",

There is something hiding just under the mint that reminds me of reading IT by Stephen King. You know something bad is in there, you just can't see it, and you're scared. I came into this shave with a mix of expectations, as u/whiskyey raved about performance, and u/ItchyPooter waxed poetic about some fish ass. They were both right. This base is legit AF, loaded super easy, slick as owl shit, and protective of your face. There was no protection for my poor nose. Pooter talked about olfactory fatigue; apparently my nose is in great shape, cause I smelled some rank fish the whole way through. I waited like 10 minutes before I applied the Reserve splash to check out the face feel on it, and it is very good. I don't really know how to feel about all this, y'all have a nice day.",

I was excited to try out this soap from an artisan active friendly and here, and that I have heard good things about. I think I overloaded and underwatered my face lather for the first couple passes as I was working through a sticky thin paste, for the third one I just kept adding more and more water until a foamier lather sprung up, and I had enough left in the brush for a week's worth of shaves. No complaints on the soap, it provided good protection and very good post shave. I can blame myself for chasing to close of a shave and ended up with several nicks around my chin and neck. And some stinging with the splash application. An hour later, nothing too bad no hot spots or large patches of red, so I think I will survive.\n\nI am looking forward to the Fantasy BB draft tonight, thanks again /u/f1gnuts for setting that up!",

I'm still noticing a lot of brush hair in my soap. Had the brush since the new year (when I first started DE shaving), and it continues to lose hairs. I picked it up on Amazon based on the solid reviews -- a rookie move now that I look back at it. I don't know if I'm going to have to start researching a replacement...",

Was a very comfortable shave. Went wtg, xtg, atg (don't often do that) then some serious touch up under my chin and my neck. Normally would not do that many passes but it was that comfortable. Was not as efficient as I'd hoped but I'm pretty sure that's just me getting used to the angle, which btw is very different than the .95. The blade is held flatter than in the .95 and felt like maybe it was also held stiffer if that makes any sense. Overall excellent shave, this razor could be used daily with ease.",

I had tried a sample of this a long time ago and I enjoyed it enough but felt slickness was average. I think I must have under loaded it on my first use. This time I was careful to use enough. The performance was good and slick. I had no trouble working up a dense lather. The post shave was also a nice surprise. My verdict is that this is a quality product. Scent wise the black pepper really comes out too, which I like. It smells very sophisticated to me.\n\nThe post shave gel is unique. It is sticky at first but absorbs quickly. My face feels great, so I'd say it's a winner. Happy Wednesday!",

Cloudy, then gradually becoming mostly sunny, with a high near 49. Calm wind becoming southwest around 5 mph. Chance of precipitation is 20%. High tide at 9:53 tonight.\n\nNice shave this morning, needed it too. Wife went into work at her normal 3:30am, and that woke up the cat, Sammy, that we just got. So Sammy spent the next 2 hours singing me the song of his people so sleep was eluding me. Now it's time to get the small one on the bus, and then off to work.\n\nHave a nice Wednesday!",

Thought it would be good to revisit some since my technique has certainly improved. I am starting with the fan favorite Gillette Silver Blue. Not as smooth to me as my usual, but i don't judge a blade on the first use alone. Lets see how it goes the rest of the week.\n\nThis soap/aftershave combo is quickly becoming one of my favorites. The post shave of the donkey milk formula of the soap combined with the reserve aftershave leaves my skin feeling great! The scent on the soap is a bit \"brighter\" than the aftershave, but i think they go well together.\n\nHappy Shaves, Everyone!",

Calm wind becoming south around 5 mph in the afternoon. High tide at 10:47 tonight.\n\nWhat most people don't know is that Awesometown is a village located just south of the Tropic of Cancer. I wanted to use this shave to remind me of the time that I spent in that quaint little part of the world. I had decided to spend some time there as the rigors of life had become just a tad stressful. I booked a room at the Barrister & Mann Inn and made my way south. Little did I know what I was in for. I stepped off the boat, and was immediately assailed by the scents of citrus and sandalwood. While I made my way up the road to the Inn I started noticing signs saying to please not bother the natural Dragon population as it's best if they are left to their own devices. Not knowing that the main industry in the town was soapmaking, and they used coveted dragon tallow, I was perplexed. When I got to the Inn, I asked the Inn keeper about it, and he explained that the town was home to the famous Soapmakers of Awesometown. While most of my trip was a blur, I do remember getting settled in my room and hearing distant strains of an Adagio drifting in the the Grand Duke Fenwick's castle.\n\nHave a nice Thursday everyone!",

A nasty weather system crossed over from Texas, dumping several inches of rain and hail throughout the night. It kept the animals riled up and several times throughout the night, a plastic bag raced past me. I suspect there was a cat or two in it but didn't check.\n\nRoads are flooding, main highways are closed but school is open. Damnit. I would have been perfectly fine starting spring break a day early. At least I have Monday to look forward to; first day off from work and school since mid January.",

Going to workout on my lunch break and shave later this evening. Wheat State makes a solid shave soap and 7 Mile Beach takes me back to my trips to Jamaica. The only thing It's missing is some jerk chicken, beans, and rice. But let's be real, that would be kind of weird in a shave soap.\n\nEDIT: Also just want to shout out the [**Theme Thursday Suggestion and Voting**](https://redd.it/86kxor) post.

The closest thing that I have is Seville (i guess cuz citrus) and Jacinthe (cuz of flowers). I put the chance up to ole faithful; any many miny moe, and I landed on Jacinthe. Bought this for my wife, but it's a nice floral... I dig it.",

This is one of my many favourite scents it's so unique and an awesome scent, too bad there was never a matching aftershave. Apparently the weather missed the memo that it's opening day, another blast of winter here in Alberta, hope to get this all cleaned up so we can enjoy opening day. Have a great day everyone, happy shaves!",

It's a scent I really like, but it often sits at the back of my den due to the lack of a matching A/S.\n\nMy nod to today's theme was the use of Lea as my aftershave. You may not think of it as tropical, but I bought it during my honeymoon in the Canary Islands. I'll probably also use the EdT I bought in the Canaries as well to remind me of the tropics during this cold grey day.\n\nEDIT: [This is the EdT I'm using.](http://www.almadecanarias.com/fragancia/fragancia-fresca/?lang=en) Quite nice and airy, and pairs well with the Lea. I found it at an artisans' Christmas market in Santa Cruz de Tenerife on the first days of our honeymoon. Quite nice for the tropics.",

It's my fave scent, so that was a good enough reason to break it out. u/NobleOtter knocked it out of the park on the scent ( with maybe a dash of help from u/NeXRenegade). Noble Otter has one of the best post shave feels out there, and I'm really looking forward to the new base. Start at a new plant in the morning, then next week will be nightshift, so the shaving routine is gonna get jacked up. Y'all have a nice day.",

I struggled a little with this soap and brush today, I seem to have overwatered as it was getting runny and bubbly in the second pass. No complaints about performance though. One nick near the corner of my mouth due to inattention. But I do like this combo of a splash then a balm a few minutes later. I think the scent of the Spice still stuck around a bit and mixed well with the citrus and achieved the fruity drink vibe that I was going for.\n\nI think we missed the boat to sync up the theme with opening day today, but I has been enjoyable to see folk's contributions.",

Areas of dense fog before 10am. High near 57. South wind 5 to 10 mph becoming west in the afternoon. Chance of precipitation is 80%. New precipitation amounts of less than a tenth of an inch possible. High tide at 11:36 tonight.\n\nHave moved Cade days to Fridays as Themed Thursday are a thing now. I think I am going to like using to more on Fridays than Thursday, purely because now I have a might-as-well-be unscented soap to not overpower some of the more delicate Frag Friday scents. I guess I will actually need to get an unscented aftershave product now so that the Frag will be the star of the show on Friday.\n\nThis brush is small. With that said, I am not a fan of small brushes but there is something about this one that works really well with the Cade. I don't have to be overly watchful about overloading this one where anything over 24mm with Cade, I've found, likes to overload. It also doesn't hog lather like some of my other brushes like to do with Cade. This might be my Friday set up until I fun out, and hop onto the Castle Forbes train.\n\nHave a nice Friday everyone!",

[Get Up, Stand Up](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Get_Up,_Stand_Up) is a song of empowerment with a powerful message and eminently danceable beat. \"Get Up, Stand Up, stand up for your right | Get Up, Stand Up, don't give up the fight\"\n\nFor the shave, back on the every other day Summer Storm.\n\nPost shave, went with CL balm, as /u/moogooguydan/ told me...the greatest tool in his den!

I liked the smell, it reminds me of Old Spice Fresh from their modernish lineup. This blade has been good, I think I am liking it in the V3A head a little better, but I happy with the shave today over 1.5 days growth and I am happy with myself that I didn't chase too close with the razor and my face feels great.\n\nHave a great weekend everyone.",

I got a little discount too because it was the last one in the store just and they couldn't find the box. I got it home, threw it in a cup of water and let it sit for a couple days. I took it out last night and dried it off with a towel a bit, and put it on the shelf to dry. After a couple of hours I noticed the hairs were splitting. This morning I looked again and saw they split some more and that the knot was mostly dry so I used it. I love it when I'm right. I had suspected that I messed up my original one when cleaning it because it was never the same after. This new one is great! It killed the lather after the first pass but I expected that.

These Dorco Prime blades were gifted to me and I've found that they work well for me. They're not my #1 blade but I'd have no problem buying a 100 pack of these.\n\nThe MiE thin handle Tech was just what I needed too. A good, mild shave that got me smooth without irritation. I like this style of handle and it being the thinner version makes it more nimble.\n\nGot an excellent lather out of Stubble Buster as well. Slickness during the shave was great and then after rinsing my face there was still a good postshave slickness where I could have done touch ups with no problems if I had needed to. Really glad that the aftershave has more scent to it. Is it as nourishing as something like CL? No, but it does the job and doesn't dry my face out. Again, for the price, both the soap and a/s are a very good value.\n\nNow I'm off to struggle through these next 4 hours at work and then a 2 hour drive back home :/",

I've been impressed with their soaps in the past, but this was my first chance getting to use the balm and deodorant. The soap performed very well as expected. The post shave feel was very noticeable and fantastic. Great shave overall!\n\nThe balm has a somewhat thick consistency. Thicker than a lotion, but not as thick as something like Chatillon Lux's salves. Seems very moisturizing so far, albeit a little greasy. Definitely plan to keep this one in my balm rotation.\n\nThe deodorant seems to be largely coconut oil based. It's almost like a paste/gel that rubs in very easy. The description claims 24 hour protection but I haven't gotten that kind of longevity yet. Not sure if I'm not using enough or I'm stinkier than the average user, but may need to find an alternate solution.\n\nAs far as scent goes, Rain is what I imagine the love child of Dapper Dragon's Signature and Declaration Grooming's After the Rain would smell like, which is to say, amazing. I get a lot of the AtR type scent with hints of melon poking it's head in here and there.\n\nFull Disclosure: It's not raining right now",

I guess from cooking the oils and dust settles on the top of the cabinets and makes this nice blackish dust that is a PITA to clean off. It's all done now, heading to the hardware store for a few last minute supplies. She wants new kitchen lights now after I told her I had to remove the fixtures to paint the ceiling.",

I already use this soap base and enjoy it a lot. The new base is very slick and an improvement over the existing base imo. Very dense and slick lather. Extremely protective. Post shave was also great. All in all an excellent shave this morning! Happy Saturday everyone.",

This is the place she was singing about). I brought my Beard Lune and Supreme Cream, but while we were out picking up groceries yesterday, I got it into my head to poke around for more local shave supplies. Now half the stores were closed due to it being Good Friday, but one of the store owners pointed me to the big bars of Zote and said that's what the locals use for EVERYTHING, including shaving.\n\nZote is a Mexican bar soap for hand-washing laundry. It's apparently a very mild beef tallow soap with citronella oil. Reminds me a lot of my pick of Williams Mug Soap. A large 200g bar cost $1 BZ which is $0.50 US. I did a test lather last night and while it wasn't B&M glissant goodness, it was better than I expected.\n\nThis morning, I actually used it for a 3-pass shave. The lather was thin but slick, not much cushion at all. But I had no razor burn, no weepers, and no sign of other irritation.\n\nZote isn't going to become part of my standard rotation, but it's probably worth taking home for further experimentation.",

If there was a text book, on the collective history of Wetshaving, this scent would be the first chapter. Because seriously, it's probably the most talked about (controversial?) Scent that's probably ever been on the market.\n\nI never had a chance to try it, until now. This scent is definitely polarizing. Off the puck of soap I get the damp earth, and a grassy scent similar to Diamond, a long with a scent of leather, and smoke.\n\nThe aftershave however, smells like soy sauce out of the bottle. However, once put on my face the aftershave embodies the same scent, maybe with a touch more Tabacco. The scent may take some getting used to. But I like it.",
