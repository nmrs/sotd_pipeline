I took the blade one shave too long, nicked my mole and was just overall uncomfortable so stopped after 1 pass. Tonight I get to break out Wolfie for its maiden voyage, not sure if I'll stick with 3017 or break out the TSM Fougere for its first use too.\n\nI missed out on that Bufflefat last night but I didn't get my hopes up either. Will posted a revised schedule so am happy that I can look forward to that. For those that missed, Barrister Reserve soaps are on the horizon for the 3 scents, 42 gets an EdT, and I think Diamond gets a month run. I guess I need to find a way to smell 42 as I would probably still blind buy at least the EdT but too much purchasing recently.\n\nNon shaving, Jets cut Revis. I think it was time but we still sunk a good chunk of money in what he's owed this year. Wish he could have gone out better. Also, Guardians volume 2 trailer looks amazing, really can't wait for that to come out.",

I actually got to leave the field for 10 days and work in one of the company's offices so I need to be somewhat presentable. My experiment with facial hair is still continuing and if I do say it is starting to to look alright at a distance. Up close it is still a little thin, especially on the connecting parts between the stache and the beard. Over the last couple weeks I have been tapering it out by adding a 1/8\" every shave to the beard portion.\n\nNow onto the shave, this is the first time in well over a year since I have used this soap while not in the field. I did not realize how well this soap actually performs when not using the hardest water imaginable. I lathered it up and got that beautiful thick creamy lather. When I go back home I will definitely be picking up another tin from them, I have been eyeing up their Island Hopper and twisted lime. The scale polish performed amazing as per usual. This will be the only post shave product I buy from now on, nothing comes close to it in performance. Ill be a little disappointed while I work through my other sets and use other aftershaves.",

So I planned on using something with the glissant base today as an unofficial test. Since I didn't want to stain my badger with Night Music and I am not quite ready to open my Cologne Russe, Beaudelaire was my only option. (What a horrible predicament to be in. /s)\n\nMy \"scientific\" findings: I can't freaking tell.\n\nOverall my shaves from today and yesterday were both fantastic. The only slight advantage I can give to white label from my very unscientific testing was it seemed to keep a thicker consistency for passes 2 and 3 slightly better than the glissant soap. That being said they are both damn fine products.\n\nPersonally I think my shave mug was too hot. I float the mug in hot water in the sink and rest the brush in it to keep the lather warm. On my second pass I noticed the lather had gotten some bubbles in it after sitting in the mug during the first pass.\n\nEnjoy your day.",

The scent just never excited me enough to try it but finally did. It's pretty meh, but wow does the lather whip up thicker and quicker than just about anything out there. Not knowing what to pair with it, I decided to reach for some mystery goo I got as part of a sample swap with someone. He wasn't even sure what it was when I asked him, I'm guessing it was DD Scale Polish which I've never used so who knows. Being Fat Tuesday and all, I figured why not throw even more on! So I reached for a sample CL slave that was labeled Fourth & Pine but smells like GTS (which is what I ordered; wasn't sure if it was mislabeled or I got the wrong thing but I wasn't fussed enough to care/ask). So who the heck knows what I applied to my face after, but it felt excessive and grand. Did the toner just for good measure, felt I needed something liquid after all the thick stuff I just rubbed on.",

Our first shave, much like last year's, is with a completely unknown quantity on my part: Hawaiian Shaving Co's *Lemi Poni'ala.* The first match of the tournament pits it against Wholly Kaw's *Lav Sublime.* Both of them are vegan formulas, both are simple blends of lavender and a citrus note, and both are soaps that I've never used. We'll talk about *Lav Sublime* tomorrow.\n\n*Lemi Poni'ala* is a really good soap. It's very easy to load and dial in a proper lather, and provides excellent slickness and protection. Performance-wise, the only thing that it's really lacking somewhat is residual slickness.\n\nIts scent is very nice as well. Off the puck all I really get is the lavender note, which is also strongest in the lather. But when lathered, the lemon note comes in brightly and just brings the whole thing up a notch. It's really a lovely scent. Hawaiian Shaving Co. is pretty new to the game, and this is their only scent, but they're doing the right thing so far. I'm interested to see what else they bring out.\n\nAll in all, a great shave, and an awesome way to begin this informal little competition. As I said last year, if this is the worst shave I get, this is going to be one hell of a fun competition.\n\nHave a great day, everyone!\n\n-----\nPrevious | Next\n:-|-:\n[March Madness 2017 Overview](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5x1fyf/march_madness_of_wet_shaving_2017_lavender_lunacy/) | [Citrus/Simple Blends, Game 1: Wholly Kaw *Lav Sublime*](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5x28d9/thursday_sotd_thread_mar_02_2017/deezokb/)",

I wet the 24mm Whipped Dog Silvertip, my floppiest badger under running water and hit the dry puck of Saponifico Varesino for exactly 15 seconds. The results were as expected, I got 4 full passes of lather plus a 5th pass as a post shave. Being this was a badger that tends to hold on to lather, there was enough left over on the brush for a thin pass. Loading and building lather was effortless, and frankly, no different than if using a synthetic.\n\nMaybe two more weeks on The Stallion splash and I can get rid of another bottle. There's something satisfying about finishing a product.",

I used my Classic Cobra, the BBS-1 of SEs! I get very close, irritation free shaves with it. I just love it, especially when paired with a Kai mild blade and premium soap.\n\nToday I tried a new fragrance, The Cobra and the Canary. Notes: Lemon, Orris, Tobacco Flowers, Leather, Hay Fields & Asphalt. I get diesel fuel, smoke, and a hint of leather. Very unusual scent profile. I think they nailed what they were going for, the feeling of racing around in a vintage sports car. Here's an excerpt from their description:\n\n\"We were driving faster than dammit, headed due west for a place called Anywhere But Here.\"\n\nWhen a tip from a clairvoyant leads 23-year old Neal Orris to a rural Connecticut barn housing his deceased father's secret obsession, a pristine 1964 Shelby Cobra Roadster, it is the getaway ticket he was desperately searching for. After liberating his best friend Ike from his dead-end job on the family farm, the two hit the open highway. Aiming for the Palm Springs race tracks, their journey is a blur of seedy motels, cool swimming pools, hot debutantes, cocktails, and cigarette smoke. Each stop finds the friends inventing new pseudonyms and personas for themselves, their innocent game hurtling into the depths of decadence and desolation.\n\nWHEN TO WEAR: Hot, hazy weekdays when you can put your life on hold and enjoy a simple luxury like a fast drive in the country.\n\nToday, I'll be racing around the office but my mind will be on a fast drive in the country. LoL\n\nEric",

Yay, now I have a big ol' bucket of Pre-Shave Butter :) This stuff does wonders for my skin. I decided to go with Delor de Treget today - it's definitely an orange lover's scent. That Bergamot + Cedar blast right at the start is amazing. It will be an awesome spring/summer scent.\n\nI used my razor on a 7 for all three passes today, and was quite pleased with the results, though I did give my neck a day off, so we'll see how it feels about that kind of setting tomorrow.\n\nThis blade doesn't feel dull or tuggy at all yet.\n\nI hit the bottom of this Bay Rum sample today, so ring of death starting to form. Seeing just how long these Stirling samples last makes me realize that my ~20 samples from them is a ridiculous amount of soap. Out of the three soaps I've broken into from Stirling so far, Bay Rum is by far my favorite. The orange mixed with the bay and spices is excellent, and a good pairing with the Delor de Treget for today. It'll be fun to see which Stirling scents knock others off the top of my list as I work my way through these samples over time.",

Usually far too thin and lacking the volume and thickness that I manage to get out other Glissant soaps (ROAM, LGC). No idea why. Today I thought fuck it, lets have it. Very small amount of water in the tips of the brush and I gave that soap [a damn good thrashing] (https://youtu.be/mv0onXhyLlE). Very small amounts of water then added sporadically to the face. The results were particularly satisfying. Extremely creamy and perfectly protective despite no prep.

My dad uses it when he's shaving with a cartridge and said it was decent so I figured it was worth a try. It's roughly the consistency of Proraso cream, a little thinner perhaps, and I thought I could build some lather with it and go to town. That wasn't happening, I can't stress enough how unusable this stuff was. I'm not sure if you're just supposed to spread a thin layer of this stuff on or what but it's not for me. I ended up rinsing all this shit down the drain and starting over, which was probably for the best as I ended up with a great shave.",

I am a bit confused though. In the past i was getting some really bad shaves with the Personnas. I had always had good luck with Astra SS's and they were inexpensive so I have about 200 at this point. Well now, my shaves with Astra's have not been as good and my Personnas have been killing it this week. Today's shave was the worst of the week but it was still a pretty damn good.\n\nPerhaps I will do some more blade exploration.",

Big shout out to u/airbornesimian for sending me a new brush and razor to try out. The brush was amazing and even better than my AOS badger hair. It held water well and made for a thicker lather than anything I had before. The razor was also a huge step up from my VDH one. You can feel the difference in your hands and the shave is just phenomenal. Definitely convincing me to upgrade sooner rather than later. Once again, super friendly community here, it really is something special.",

And when I get home, I will have a package laying on my doorstep with Poraso white, a Fine slant, and a Frank Shaving 24mm ivory handle brush!

There isn't much out there that beats the comfort and post shave feel of a T+S & CL combination shave. The scent is fantastic, and since the temperature dropped from 17 degrees yesterday to -10 today (Celcius) and of course a light dusting of snow (it always snows on my birthday), this was the perfect shave to remind me that spring is almost here.

It really is a scent for the early fall. It's bright and damp, with a sour edge that hints at the coming decay of fall and winter. There's also some sharp woodiness that runs through it. Like all the Stirling soaps I've tried, it performed extremely well for me. For me it's easy to load and lather. It has very good cushion, glide and residual slickness, but with the shea butter and lanolin, it has an absolute top notch post-shave feel. Pairing this scent is a little tricky. The bright citrus and spicy florals on the Lalique are a nice compliment, but the Lalique Gold is not an easy wear, it's something that demands your attention to appreciate, and something I need to be in the mood for in order to wear. Another good choice for this one would be Guerlain's Habit Rouge.\n\n\n\nHave a good one!\n\n\n\n**Soaps**\n\n[<< Speick Men - Shaving Cream](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5wn0oc/tuesday_sotd_thread_feb_28_2017/debinkk/)\n\n[Stirling Soap Co. - Barbershop >>](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5x9drg/friday_sotd_thread_mar_03_2017/degh67p/)\n****\n\n**Tours**\n\n[Razor Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5lefc9/happy_new_year_sotd_thread_jan_01_2017/dbv6f4p/)\n\n[Brush Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5o322q/sunday_sotd_thread_jan_15_2017/dcgf5ud/)\n\n[Soap Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5q99m5/thursday_sotd_thread_jan_26_2017/dcxird1/)\n",

      "body": "**Mar 2: New Cream - Vitos Tabacco**\n\n**Lather:** Vitos (Susan Darnell) Tabacco Professional cream\n**Brush:** Vie-Long 13071M brown horse-hair (24mm/52mm)\n**Razor:** Schick Injector (Type E3 - Made in Canada)\n**Blade:** Personna Injector [7]\n**Post:** Lucky Tiger After Shave and Face Tonic\n**Splash:** RazoRock The Stallion\n\n**Tobacco and Brown Horse Thursday - It's the Law**\n\nFirst use with the Vitos Tabacco cream \"sample\" I received yesterday from Connaught Shaving. The \"sample\" comes in an actual 100ml tub that's full to the top for about $5. It's a soft cream, normally sold in a 500ml squeeze tube, so I grabbed a snurdle with my index finger and applied it directly to my face. Good stuff, very creamy thick lather that can take a lot of water and not fall apart. The smooth brush handle felt very slippery in the hand so the soap has slickness without a hint of greasiness (like most creams)\n\nScent-wise, calling this a tobacco scent is a bit of a stretch. Yes, I can definitely detect the tobacco, but it's in the background, with the overwhelming fragrance being just a clean \"creamy\" scent. I can't say anything negative about the soap, but it did not knock my socks off scent-wise like a tobacco soap should.\n\nSecond shave with the new razor, /u/Old_Hiker's favorite injector, the [Canadian Schick Type E3](http://i.imgur.com/FWuH8YT.jpg). I've been hunting for a cheap one for over a year and finally snagged one for about US$11, and it cleaned up nicely.\n\nI don't need to do a side-by-side shave to tell this razor is markedly smoother than any Type E2 or later injector I own. Now all this smoothness comes at a cost. This razor is waaaaaay milder and less efficient than any Type E, G, ~~or the Hydro-Magic~~\n\nLook at the [geometry compared to the Type E2](http://i.imgur.com/xBrmYhG.jpg), in particular, the location of the blade stops with respect to the safety bar. The blade on the Canadian E3 is so much farther away from the edge of the safety bar - less blade exposure means the razor is less aggressive/efficient.\n\nThe proof is in the shave. With a relatively new blade, it took me 4 passes to get were I usually get with the E2 in 2.5 to 3 passes. That said, this razor will earn a spot in the rotation purely because of it's smoothness since I usually do a 4 pass shave every day anyhow. The end result is the same ... it's all about the journey. I'm happy I got this razor.\n\nEdit: my brain thinks one thing but my fingers type something else.",

Put down the pitchforks everyone, just some light ribbing. I went CADE yesterday, so I thought I would go back-to-back with another cream and see the differences. These two creams are very close in quality of lather. I would give the slightest advantage to CADE. For the scent comparison: FORGETTABOUTIT! Castle Forbes win in spades. CADE is a nice, light scent that is mostly non-offensive to me. Castle Forbes *Lime* is the shit. Of course if you aren't a big citrus fan, you can certainly pick out the *Lavender* or *Cedarwood & Sandalwood* from them. For the post shave - this is where it gets to splitting hairs (pun intended) - I would have to go with CADE. That's my 2 cents worth. Great Thursday shaves to all.\nEDIT: Fixed formatting",

It didn't work very well and I was pretty unimpressed and haven't touched it since. On a whim, I tried putting some in a bowl like a sample and lathering it that way and it worked MUCH better. The smell completely changes when lathered vs in the jar, and is quite a nice scent. Rating definitely going up now that I know how to lather it and unlock it's true scent.\n\nedit: copy/paste fail\n\n",

I love his tallow base, though, so I was excited to try this one out, and I'm glad it came up in the bracket so early.\n\nFirst of, let's compare scents. Even though *Lav Sublime* and *Lemi Poni'ala* are both lavender plus a citrus note, they're radically different from one another. The first difference, of course, is the citrus note itself. *Lemi Poni'ala* uses lemon, whereas *Lav Sublime* uses lime. The citrus note is much more muted in *Lav Sublime,* and the lavender note is actually a bit smoother as well. The overall bouquet of *Lav Sublime* is very mellow, whereas that of *Lemi Poni'ala* is overall much brighter. I like both, but in different ways. The *Lav Sublime* bouquet would be excellent and relaxing for a night shave, but the brighter notes of *Lemi Poni'ala* make it more enjoyable for a morning shave to me.\n\nPerformance-wise, they're also very similar. I noticed that the lather I whipped up from *Lemi Poni'ala* yesterday was much...creamier? than the lather I got out of the *Lav Sublime* sample this morning. During my WTG pass, yesterday, I could barely feel my blade cutting at all, and I could definitely feel it cutting this morning. Overall effectiveness was the same, though, and this only affected that WTG pass. The slickness between the two soaps was about the same between the two, as was residual slickness (both not great but not bad either).\n\nThe other area in which they diverge is post-shave feel. Although not by much, *Lemi Poni'ala's* post-shave feel was noticeably better than *Lav Sublime.* I also noticed that *Lav Sublime's* post-shave is noticeably different from that of Wholly Kaw's tallow base, which is interesting.\n\nThese two are both very good soaps, and very close in every respect. That said, between my slight preference for its scent, and its slightly better post-shave feel, I have to give this one to the newcomer. *Lemi Poni'ala* advances to the quarter-finals, where it will go up against the winner of Stirling's *Lavender Bergamot* vs. Reef Point's *Tranquility,* which are two heavy hitters in their own right.\n\nEnjoy your day, everyone!\n\n-----\nPrevious | Next\n:-|-:\n[Citrus/Simple Blends, Game 1: Hawaiian Soap Co. *Lemi Poni'ala*](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5wui0p/wednesday_sotd_thread_mar_01_2017/ded9yub/) | [Citrus/Simple Blends, Game 2: Stirling *Bergamot Lavender*](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5x9drg/friday_sotd_thread_mar_03_2017/deglm42/)",

Ended up dehydrated with a massive headache (maybe from all the sake last night..?), and chose a number of products that don't quite work together. First time using Bespoke #1, which I'm not a fan of. It's a vetiver earthy blend that also contains amber, frankincense, myrrh, clove, pepper, bergamot, patchouli, cedar, vanilla, anise, and labdanum. Too much going on for my taste. B&M cool is great stuff, very similar to Floid Blue. Cape Heartache was a new one for me as well today - woody notes but also very forward with a sweet strawberry scent. Kind of a crazy mash up of scents.",

Looks about the size of a standard sample, so maybe 5-6 more shaves with it?\n\nThis shave was a little bit less comfortable than the last few, perhaps the blade finally starting to show a bit of wear, but I'll keep going with it and see if it smooths out again.\n\nMy verdict on Fine aftershaves is not decided. They definitely aren't as nice on my skin as other artisan splashes, but the scent strength is pretty nuts. I find my skin does decently well with them when immediately chased by a balm - like before the splash even finishes drying. Doing it that way also seems to let the scent of the splash come through a bit stronger.\n\nHope y'all have a good day!",

Heading into it, I had my money on the I2 being smoother and more efficient than the Supply Provision razor. My process was to use each razor to shave half of my face, rinse off, check stubble, relather and proceed.\n\n\nAfter the first pass, I felt that the SP had a slight advantage in efficiency due to less stubble feel but was slightly less smooth. Both razors seemed neck and neck after the second pass. After a third pass, the SP was slightly more efficient but definitely not as smooth as the I2. Really can't go wrong with either razor.\n\nOn a side note, the SP is definitely harder to hold when lather gets on the handle. The little 40033 had some lather slide down onto the handle and it squirted out of my hand at one point and went skydiving across the bathroom. I didn't notice the lather on my hand when I picked up the razor until I felt it slipping out, set it down and rinsed everything off. No issues after that.",

This shave is as good as it gets for me. I can't seem to put this brush down. I have a couple other brushes coming in soon but I absolutely love this one.\n\n[Declaration d'un Soir](http://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Cartier/Declaration-d-Un-Soir-15462.html) is rose, spice and a bit of woods. Definitely a cool weather Frag. Lasts quite a long time and at its affordable price it's a hell of a value. If you aren't sure about rose or think it's too feminine, give this stuff a try. About as masculine as a rose can smell.",

Gotta say, I see what all the hype is about--it's just a solid, solid product offering massive value. I was super excited to get my box of 8 soap samples, 4 aftershave samples, and some bath soap (which were all expertly packed, btw), but had some trouble sniffing them individually since all of the scents sort of melded together a bit right out of the box. Now that I've got a few on their own in their respective tins I'm really impressed by how well-crafted the scents are. Straightforward and strong and I really like that. The only question I have is...Piacenza or Ben Franklin tomorrow??\n\nHave a great day, peeps!",

It's a pretty attractive razor. It feels solid, and relatively heavy in the hand. It does show signs of the black coating flaking off (this evidently started before it arrived with me). The range of blade gap is huge. 1 is pretty small, 5 is enormous. I used it on 2.5 WTG, 3 XTG (I only do two passes). Overall, I found the razor quite comfortable in the hand. It also performed quite well, being both comfortable and efficient. I've got almost a weeks worth of shaves before I send it on to it's next user, and I'm looking forward to further experimentation. I think I'm going to gradually increase the blade gap. I want one shave at 5 before I send it on it's way. Hopefully my face will survive.\n\nOn another note, L'Occitane was a nice balm to go with the Lavender Pour Homme. Both aren't quite pure lavender scents, and they compliment each other nicely.",

So as of today, I'm on to try again with a new blade.\n\n\n\nToday's shave was with my favorite barbershop scent. Sweet vanilla and powdery musk. For pairing, I went with the Equus.

Then on to a generous sample of MdC. This soap has been a touch more drying than other soaps I have, but not near as drying as WMS or Arko. I'm curious how my skin will react to MdC.\n\nAnother good shave with a well used Polsilver and my SC. It's safe to say that the efficiency of the blade has fallen off, but I'm still not getting any irritation. I'll certainly go to 60, but probably not far beyond that. I'm getting bored with it.\n\nI don't talk about Lucky Tiger and Oil of Olay much. Even with a drying soap, these two products together work wonders for my ugly mug. Off to enjoy Friday.",

I like that the almond scent is only faintly there, since almond isn't my jam, and this one isn't as sweet, more creamy. As far as the performance goes, it's the shit. So good that I went all Terry-Crews-in-an-Old-Spice-commercial and punch a hole in my wall? Not necessarily, but it's still really great stuff. Glad I managed to snag some. It's nice to have a high-performing soap with a neutral scent for those times I'm tired and want to give my nose the morning off.",

We're starting off with Stirling's *Bergamot Lavender.* This soap's performance is awesome. It has everything: Slickness, protection, residual slickness, great post-shave, hell, even yer grampap. It even managed to prop up the dying Schick blade in my E2.\n\nIts scent is goddamn dynamite, too. Rod describes it as follows\n\n>If Lavender had a peel, this is what it would smell like. Spicy, sweet, floral, and most definitely unique. (Essential Oil)\n\nAnd I agree wholeheartedly. It manages to be sweet, tart, spicy and floral at the same time, and none of these qualities is overpowering; they're all nice and mellow. Out of the tub, that dark citrus punch goes hard, but when lathered it calms down and blends nicely with the lavender note. It's a fantastic pairing. It's actually exactly what I wanted when I first thought about what lavender + citrus would/could be.\n\n*Bergamot Lavender* is, at the time of this writing, a strong contender for the title, but a lot can happen during the next 27 shaves, not the least of which is that it's up against Reef Point, the defending champion, tomorrow.\n\n[Friday!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlyXNRrsk4A) Catch up with you tomorrow, all.\n\n-----\nPrevious | Next\n:-|-:\n[Citrus/Simple Blends, Game 1: Wholly Kaw *Lav Sublime*](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5x28d9/thursday_sotd_thread_mar_02_2017/deezokb/) | [Citrus/Simple Blends, Game 2: Reef Point *Tranquility*](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5xg4cd/saturday_sotd_thread_mar_04_2017/dehzs8q/)\n",

I really like the scent so that just adds to the disappointment. The aftershave didn't bother me.

I plan to use the Scale Polish in concert with splashes for the most part, but gave it a test all by itself today. My skin feels smooth but not oily - it's kind of weird actually, but not in a bad way.\n\nToday's shave was a little bit rough on my neck. I think I got a tad overzealous, and even gave myself a couple of nicks for the first time in a few weeks. Perhaps part of the issue was the blade - I think I'll give it one more try, and if it doesn't improve, I'll toss it.\n\nHave a good shave and good day, everybody.",

It wasn't very strong but was just a clean smell. My face did feel dry after the shave though, but the post shave balm seemed to help. For anyone that has used the arko stick, how do you load you brush? I just held it in my hand and loaded it while just exposing the top of the stick.",

I took the top cap of a Thick Cap OT and put it on my FaTip Piccolo base plate. While it did make it a tiny bit smoother than a stock FaTip, it still was a bit harsh. That lasted for precisely one pass. Since I already had all the pieces in front of me, I just reassembled the Thick Cap OT. This was better, but still not as comfortable as other razors that I tend to use more often. This lasted for the second pass. I wanted to finish my shave with a smooth, comfortable razor. I dropped the blade in my V3A and did the last two passes. I know you guys are sick of hearing it, but this razor just plain works exceptionally well for me.\n\nThis brush has quickly become my favorite badger. I don't own, and likely never will, any high end badgers, but this one suits me just fine. I loaded the hell out of it and even after four passes I ended up flushing two more passes worth of lather down the drain.\n\nMonday will be the day that I tie my personal best for blade uses. This thing just won't give it up.",

Problem with the Parker is that it's uncomfortable with the majority of blades I've tried. The Rapira was tuggy at points and irritated my skin a bit too, it didn't seem very efficient either. Astras are great and Wilkinson Sword blades are good but everything else I've tried is less than pleasant.\n\nThe Haslinger was very good. Once I started lathering it I was initially disappointed since it was very frothy and foamy. It was wayyy too messy and airy for me to want to work with so I just drained the brush and started lathering again. This time the lather exploded and it was very rich and thick. After about 15/20 seconds I started face lathering and it was very dense, I had to add a hell of a lot of water. I was a bit disappointed with the first pass in all honesty, I added way more water than I would have done with any other soap but it was still not as slick as I hoped. For the time I spent adding water and working it I expected a slicker soap. That was probably my fault though since I think I loaded too much. However, on the second and third passes the lather was pretty much perfect. Rich, creamy and slick at the same time. There was also a lot of lather left at the end, I'll have to load less next time. The scent was very light (to me) and I could barely smell it, pleasant scent but wish it was a bit stronger. Though bare in mind that I'm not very good with scents and such.\n\nHappy shaves, everyone.",

      "body": "#SOTD: 04 March 2017\n###March Madness of Wet Shaving Lavender Lunacy: Sweet Sixteen\n\n***Pre-Shave:*** *Hot water splashes, proto-lather.*\n***Lather:*** *Reef Point Soaps* Tranquility.\n***Brush:*** *24mm Stirling Finest fan in butterscotch handle.*\n***Razor:*** *Schick Injector E2 w/Chinese Schick blade (47).*\n***Post-Shave:*** *Extra lather, cold water splashes, Thayer's* Lavender *Witch Hazel, L'Occitane* L'Occitan *Post-Shave Balm.*\n***Soundtrack:*** Bachelor No. 2 (Or, the Last Remains of the Dodo) *by Aimee Mann.*\n\n\n\n#####*Citrus/Simple Blends Division, Game 2:* Bergamot Lavender *vs.* Tranquility\n\nRound 2 of our 2nd game features last year's champion soap maker, Reef Point Soaps. *Tranquility* doesn't exactly fit this category, because its lavender note isn't complemented by a citrus note, but it's the best possible fit given its profile.\n\n\n\n>*Quick aside: This is going to happen a few more times. At the end of the day, grouping these soaps was like seating guests at a wedding: You match up people the best you can based on your knowledge of their relationships and personalities, and then once the event happens 1% of them complain about their seating and you have that one frumpy aunt who gathers up those complaints and reports them to your mother because she wants everyone else to be as miserable as she is and knows it'll make your mom fret for no goddamn reason.*\n\n\n\nAnyway, *Tranquility* doesn't quite mesh because its 2nd note is peppermint rather than some form of citrus. Honestly I think it's aptly named: It *is* tranquil. It's also invigorating because of that peppermint. Off the puck, it's 100% peppermint. Overpoweringly so (unless you love peppermint, I suppose). I was a bit concerned that it would drown out the lavender in the lather, and at first I thought it had, because that note is still very strong in the lather.\n\nHowever, during the shave I started to notice that the peppermint scent wasn't really straight-up peppermint, but something a bit...softer, somehow. When lathered, the lavender note comes right through the bouquet and grounds the peppermint in an amazing and relaxing way, which is kind of lavender's shtick. This scent manages to be both invigorating and relaxing at the same time, which is magic.\n\nPerformance between both *Tranquility* and *Bergamot Lavender* was roughly equal. There are different nuances, but effectively they both provide the same slickness, protection and post-shave feel. I do like what *Tranquility's* scent profile does slightly more than *Bergamot Lavender's,* so in this game I'm giving the nod to *Tranquility* on basis of scent.\n\nLast year, Reef Point went up against Stirling in the semi-finals and won, also based on my preference for the scent. History repeats. Is this a sign of things to come? No idea, because I've still got 12 soaps to try out before we even get to the quarter-finals. Also last year, Reef Point got a bye into the semis, because it went up against *Ghost Town Barber* and I was just using that soap to fill a space in the bracket. This year, it earned its first progression. I can already tell that this is going to be an awesome month of shaves.\n\nOur first quarter-final match is slated to begin March 17th: Hawaiian Shave Co's *Lemi Poni'ala* vs. Reef Point Soaps' *Tranquility,* which means the next time I use this soap I'll likely be hungover af. Should be exciting.\n\nBut, that's way too far in the future to think about right now. Tomorrow, we start the *Creams* division with Speick, which is the dark horse contender in that division.\n\nHappy Saturday, all!\n\n-----\nPrevious | Next\n:-|-:\n[Citrus/Simple Blends, Game 2: Stirling *Bergamot Lavender*](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5x9drg/friday_sotd_thread_mar_03_2017/deglm42/) | [Creams, Game 1: Speick](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5xm0vz/sunday_sotd_thread_mar_05_2017/dejgoec/)",

Wow, the post-shave skinfeel is crazy moisturized. I feel like I could've gotten away with no aftershave. GTB is an awesome scent - some of the powdery floral notes I recognize from the only other Barsbershop scent I've tried, (Maggard's London Barbershop), but instead of the fresh and clean route that one took, GTB is a more of a warm scent. Very nice.\n\nThis blade gave me no reason to throw it away today, so still it remains.\n\nGreat feeling shave - the BR aftershave is awesome. Great scent (though doesn't last long, but that's fine, makes it easier to put on a fragrance), and amazing feeling.\n\nGood shaves, and good day all!",

Decided I would shave the head as well (like I used to do before I started wetshaving). To me it seemed okay, with a lot of weepers that I'm chalking up to not doing my head before, and the learning curve. I hopped back in to a cold shower to rinse my head, and pretty much used my styptic pencil like an alum block. I got out, and the wife mentioned that I got a mole on the back of my head pretty good, so I had her deal with that. I had planned on using CL Vide Pouche as my aftershave, but thought that alcohol and menthol would be two of the last things i would want on my head right now. Just have to do it more often to get better at it. **TL;DR** Shaved head for first time; used styptic pencil like alum block; have to do more often to get better at it.\n\nHave a good Saturday!",

I ordered several samples from Stirling to try out, and almost immediately ordered a full tub of this one. It's an intriguing scent, and one that's a bit tough to describe. Lightly sweet, fruity and floral, but with a musky undertone to ground it. To me, the Mountain Man actually smells better than it's inspiration, Creed Silver Mountain Water, but they still pair well. However, I've gotten to a point where I (almost) always pair this one with Cartier Declaration d'Un Soir. It's a great example of complimentary scent pairings. The scents from Mountain Man add a nice balance to the spicy rose and sandalwood in the Cartier, somewhat smoothing it's peppery opening. They don't really smell the same at all, they just blend together very well.\n\n\n\nHave a good one!\n\n\n\n**Soaps**\n\n[<< Stirling Soap Co. - Barbershop](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5x9drg/friday_sotd_thread_mar_03_2017/degh67p/)\n\n[Tallow + Steel - Yuzu/Rose/Patchouli >>](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5xm0vz/sunday_sotd_thread_mar_05_2017/dejdhtk/)\n****\n\n**Tours**\n\n[Razor Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5lefc9/happy_new_year_sotd_thread_jan_01_2017/dbv6f4p/)\n\n[Brush Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5o322q/sunday_sotd_thread_jan_15_2017/dcgf5ud/)\n\n[Soap Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5q99m5/thursday_sotd_thread_jan_26_2017/dcxird1/)\n",

Arctica falls in their Premium category, at $19 a tub. Very nice soap. It was super easy to get a creamy slick lather going. Residual slickness was great. Cushion was decent. Very good moisturizing, reminiscent of Nuavia (but not quite as good). I was hoping for a stronger scent and stronger menthol. The eucalyptus and menthol were mild, which probably works for most people. This is definitely one of the better artisan soaps that I've tried. Overall, great shave today!",

I'll try silicone next time, and try to be a little more thorough with it so I don't have the heart attack of a knot flying across the shower when I'm trying to flick water out of it. Luckily, this shave was a lot less eventful, the most exciting thing that happened was the ring of death finally formed on my Ogallala. Time to place an order, haha!",

Very resinous and balsamic and smoky, with tobacco flower on top. If you like tobacco scents this could be a favorite.\n- [Clementine California](http://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Atelier-Cologne/Cl-mentine-California-42249.html) - Citrus and vetiver, you've heard this before right? However, like with Orange Sanguine, Atelier manages to absolutely nail the scent of fresh peeled clementines in the opening. After the big hit of clementine wears off, you're left with a generic \"masculine\" blend of vetiver, sandalwood, and spices. What an opening though.",

I feel like I have technique down decently now, but I'm caught in a loop where I need to let my neck rest for a couple days in a row to let earlier irritation subside, but when I let the hairs grow in they get prickly and make my neck feel irritated again.\n\nThis blade may or may not have contributed to irritation on my neck, but as I'm going to try and give my neck a few days off, I might as well keep using this blade, as it's not causing any irritation on my face.\n\nDapper Dragon's Scale Polish is nice - makes my skin feel soft and healthy, but not greasy. It also seems to pack quite the punch in the menthol department. Might be interested in picking up a scented one or two - can anybody speak to the scent strength on those?\n\nHope everybody has a great shave and a great Sunday.",

It has enough backbone to make short work of even the hardest soap.\n\nOn the verge of tying a record for blade use. It won't go very far beyond it though. It has stopped cutting efficiently. It still isn't giving me any irritation, but I'm having to do more touch ups due to its lack of cutting efficiency.\n\nI'll finish up my tax returns today and then be a couch potato. Enjoy the day.",

Also my first go with B2 hair. Pillowy soft, good flow through, not as much backbone as B1. I'm not sure which I prefer at this point, but they're both goooooooood.\n\nI didn't know these were supposed to be complimentary scents until /u/BostonPhotoTourist pointed it out to me. Tried it, and it's an amazing scent combination. Definitely gives me a new appreciation for Cologne Russe.\n\nThe blade has settled down. It's like a new blade again. This blade longevity thing might be a good idea after all.\n\nSOTD Yesterday:\n\n* **Blade:** Gillette Platinum (16)\n* **Brush:** Declaration Brushworks Franklin #1\n* **Razor:** Wolfman WR1-SB 0.74mm on WRH7\n* **Lather:** Tallow + Steel vs. Chatillon Lux Yuzu/Rose/Patchouli\n* **Post:** Chatillon Lux Yuzu/Rose/Patchouli salve\n\nI think this might be one of my favourite fragrances, if not my favourite fragrance from /u/hawns. It's just so well done, the rose and patchouli are such a great, classic scent combination. I guess there's citrus in there somewhere too, but all I smell is rose and patchouli. Bravo.\n\nI've had the salve sample for a while and haven't ever used it, but I decided yesterday what the heck. It's good shit.\n\nSOTD Today:\n\n* **Blade:** Gillette Platinum (17)\n* **Razor:** Wolfman WR1-SB 0.74mm on WRH7\n* **Brush:** Wolf Whiskers THBS Cranberry Crush with TGN Grade A Silvertip\n* **Lather:** Castle & Forbes Cedarwood & Sandalwood cream\n* **Post:** Castle & Forbes Cedarwood & Sandalwood aftershave balm\n\nLooking forward to this shave. I'll report back later on how it went. This is the only cream I use, but it's the only cream I really think I need.",

If I could only have one software setup to use for the rest of my life, this one would be it. I almost completely missed out on this wonderful experience, as I didn't see the original group buy on this soap. In a very fortunate turn of events, there were some extras that were put up for sale, and I managed to get one. The Tallow + Steel soap base is nice and firm. It loads and lathers easily, and has excellent performance all the way around. What truly makes it all work for me though, is the Yuzu/Rose/Patchouli fragrance. It's sharp and bright from the yuzu, sweet and floral from the rose, and grounded by the herbal and lightly earthy patchouli. None of these really stand out as dominant though. Everything is well blended to create a unique and beautiful scent. I used this daily for my brush tour, and loved every shave with it, never tiring of the scent as I made my way through the brushes. Unfortunately I was unaware of exactly how much I would love this soap, and only bought one tub. So, this is the point where I beg /u/ryan_tallowandsteel and /u/hawns to get the band back together for another tour at some point in the future, so I can put a few tubs into long term storage. For pairing this one, I tend to focus on the rose element of the soap. To fully make it a desert island setup, I would probably switch my fragrance out for Amouage Lyric man. However I wore that last night and wanted to mix things up a little this morning, so I went with the other one I gravitate toward for this soap, which is the Santal Majuscule.\n\n\n\nHave a good one!\n\n\n\n**Soaps**\n\n[<< Stirling Soap Co. - Mountain Man](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5xg4cd/saturday_sotd_thread_mar_04_2017/dei1v3m/)\n\n[Taylor of Old Bond Street - Sandalwood >>](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5xsaix/monday_sotd_thread_mar_06_2017/dekm1gj/)\n****\n\n**Tours**\n\n[Razor Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5lefc9/happy_new_year_sotd_thread_jan_01_2017/dbv6f4p/)\n\n[Brush Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5o322q/sunday_sotd_thread_jan_15_2017/dcgf5ud/)\n\n[Soap Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5q99m5/thursday_sotd_thread_jan_26_2017/dcxird1/)\n",

We're expecting rain later so it was just messy storm swell. I went back home, made an awesome cup of coffee and had an enjoyable Sunday shave. I used a reduced gap Wolfman, which gives my skin a little break but is an awesome shaver. This CWSW soap is legit. Most artisan soap underperforms the big dogs, but this one hangs. I also think it's a pretty good value at $19 compared to $38+ for Castle Forbes, $71 for SMN V3, $62 for Nuavia, etc. I continue to be impressed by Soap Commander balms.\n\nHave a great Sunday everyone!",

Our first contestant is Speick. I've used (and love) Speick soap before, but never the cream, so I was keenly interested in seeing how its performance is compared to the soap.\n\nSpeick soap is an awesome, and in my opinion very underrated, product. Its performance is out of this world. it's as slick and protective as any other soap I've used, and has good if not outstanding post-shave feel. The cream has all of those same performance qualities and then some. It actually ups the ante in the residual slickness and post-shave feel aspects. It also has a bit of a cooling factor that I don't get from the soap. I'm not sure where that comes from, because there's no menthol or anything listed in the ingredients. At any rate, Speick cream is an all-around excellent performer, exceeding certain aspects of its soap form. Its performance is at least equal to the vaunted **CADE** Rich Cream.\n\nIts scent is identical to the soap in every respect. Directly from the tube, it's a deceptively simple lavender with just a hint of spiciness. When lathered, that beautiful, peppery speick extract comes in and gives the lavender excellent depth and warmth, and the citrus notes pop up to brighten the whole ensemble.\n\nSpeick is easily one of my favorite scents, and the performance of the cream is impressive. In this round it's up against Castle Forbes, a luxury cream and a juggernaut by reputation. I've never used Castle Forbes, but if it lives up to that reputation, this one is going to be an awesome match.\n\nEnjoy your Sunday, all.\n\n-----\nPrevious | Next\n:-|-:\n[Citrus/Simple Blends, Game 2: Reef Point *Tranquility*](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5xg4cd/saturday_sotd_thread_mar_04_2017/dehzs8q/) | [Creams, Game 1: Castle Forbes Lavender](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5xsaix/monday_sotd_thread_mar_06_2017/deko87b/)",

Less irritation today than yesterday, but I was still moving pretty quickly so I think it's me not the blade. The scent on this soap is really nice, but not very strong. Overall not a bad soap. Love the A/S milk wish I had it in pantie dropper. Also got my first fountain pen, this sub is just a hole to throw money in. Hope everyone's having a good Sunday. Just posted this in the wrong place glad to get my day back on track.",

It's called Wild Chilly and it's run by /u/katul_. Here's a link to the shop: http://wildchilly.com/ I very much suspect he's the only online shaving vendor of wet shaving products in Korea. Well, maybe there's another down in Busan, but I don't know for sure. Anyway, it's nice to see wet shaving products in Korea...somewhere outside of my home and /u/chevro1et's home.",

Today is definitely a far drop from yesterday's pinnacle. The TOBS sandalwood was the first real shaving cream I bought when I picked up my initial gear on Amazon. I loved the scent as soon as I smelled it. With no other point of refrence other than generic clean goo smell, the strong fragrancing on the TOBS sandalwood was mind blowing. Since then, after exploring the world of wet shaving soaps and fragrances, I now find it to smell like a sharp woody synthetic mess. Not terrible, but not my favorite. My real problem with the TOBS though, is not the scent. Nor is it the performance, which is also not terrible. My problem is that something in the TOBS melts my face off. No other soap or cream I've reacted to comes close to doing to me what the TOBS does. From the second it goes on, it's like a blow torch is being applied. Mix that with a feather blade that's on a seriously bad downward spiral, and today was one of the worst shaves I've had in quite some time. So, knowing this was all coming, and having been sitting on this bottle of Classic waiting for the right time to use it, I decided to give the old Barrister's Reserve a true test. Horrible shave, no balm, what can you do for me. The immediate application intensified the burn, it is alcohol based, but settled everything back down to tolerable after a couple of minutes. After about 30 minutes, everything seemed to be about a smoothed as can be expected after the chemical burn trauma (still burning a little). I don't feel as moisturized as when using a balm, but that's not unexpected. The good thing is, I haven't gone super dry, which is the normal reaction when only using a splash.\n\n\n\nHave a good one!\n\n\n\n**Soaps**\n\n[<< Tallow + Steel - Yuzu/Rose/Patchouli](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5xm0vz/sunday_sotd_thread_mar_05_2017/dejdhtk/)\n\n[Van der Hagen - Luxury >>](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5xzduc/tuesday_sotd_thread_mar_07_2017/dem8ozy/)\n****\n\n**Tours**\n\n[Razor Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5lefc9/happy_new_year_sotd_thread_jan_01_2017/dbv6f4p/)\n\n[Brush Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5o322q/sunday_sotd_thread_jan_15_2017/dcgf5ud/)\n\n[Soap Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5q99m5/thursday_sotd_thread_jan_26_2017/dcxird1/)\n",

Many find the Hawk to be aggressive but I've found it to be comfortable with many blades, though I experience the least tugging with the Proguard. Soap performed very well, still impressed with the lather release of the Stirling brush and the Nivea balms are great as always. I love the scent of the cooling balm especially.\n\nHappy shaves, everyone.\n\n",

This is one of the makers that's been getting some buzz lately, in discussions of suitable replacements for **CADE** Rich cream for those of us who are dissatisfied with L'Occitane's back-and-forth information about that cream's potential demise. During initial discussions about setting up this tournament, Castle Forbes was a favorite to win the *Creams* division. I shaved with it this morning.\n\nMuch like **CADE**, this is a very firm cream, and given an entire jar I would probably load directly from it. I may actually move my sample into a larger container and do just that. It's performance is nothing short of stellar. It's easy to lather, it provides top notch slickness, protection, residual slickness and post-shave feel. By my estimation, its performance is absolutely equal to **CADE** Rich cream.\n\nIts performance is also equal in every respect to that of Speick cream. I could discern no difference between the two. In fact, both yesterday and today I'd inadvertently missed spots, which I didn't notice until after I'd applied my extra lather, cleaned up and rinsed it off, and with both of these creams I was able to just give the spots a quick buff using only the residual slickness left by the extra lather application. I've seldom seen two products that perform so similarly (or maybe I'm just blind to some of the more nuanced aspects of them).\n\nCastle Forbes' scent is also top-notch. It's a simple, yet elegant lavender that has no sense of being synthetic or manufactured. It's just like smelling a lavender plant; soft, relaxing and generally soothing. If I were an evening shaver, I would love to go to bed smelling this. I really love smelling it now, in fact. However, I think that I prefer Speick's complexity to its simplicity. Everything else being equal, this round goes to Speick on the basis of scent preference.\n\nWhat an upset! Many of you will likely consider me crazy, and you probably aren't wrong. Castle Forbes is a 100% excellent product, and I can easily see why it's so highly regarded among its adherents. It dueled with grace and honor.\n\nSo far, this has been my favorite match-up in the tournament. I'm excited to see what happens in the next round, and also the next game. Starting tomorrow, we match up two more British creams who also have excellent reputations: St. James of London and Simpson's. Stay tuned!\n\n-----\nPrevious | Next\n:-|-:\n[Creams, Game 1: Speick](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5xm0vz/sunday_sotd_thread_mar_05_2017/dejgoec/) | [Creams, Game 2: St. James of London *Lavender & Geranium*](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5xzduc/tuesday_sotd_thread_mar_07_2017/demb7na/)",

The scent makes you feel like you are wearing a flight jacket about to take off in a F/A18 and the AS balm has enough bite to make you feel it for about 15 mins. The performance of it is top notch, and the only draw back that I can find is that it is a thirsty soap. So here I am asking the question...why don't more people use Reef Point Soaps?",

It was a sample from Stirling that I got as part of a set when I started with a DE a few weeks ago. I went with this today because I have been battling a head cold for a few days now and wanted to see if the menthol would help with the congestion. I'll say it helped mildly but as far as my shave went it was tremendous. I actually felt like the lather got colder each pass and I thought this was pretty cold. Can't wait to compare this to the CF Cryogen that should be delivered sometime this week.\n\nAlso used a bowl for the first time rather than palm lather as I had been. For me it was an improvement as it was neater and did allow me to shave with my other hand if needed.\n\nProbably the last shave with this blade. Only been three shaves but at 7 cents each I could easily change them out each shave if I wanted to.\n\nGotta say that each shave seems better than the last. To bad it's only a once a day event.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/Z2EXo",

      "body": "Forgot to post this yesterday\n\n[SOTN - 3/4/17](http://i.imgur.com/2DSremH.jpg) - Defiance Passaround from /u/BALD_and_BEARDLESS\n\n* **Prep:** Glycerin Soap\n\n* **Brush:** Simpson Chubby 2 Best\n\n* **Soap:** Dr. Jon's Defiance\n\n* **Razor:** 59 Fatboy set on 4\n\n* **Blade:** - Astra SP\n\n* **Post:** - Dr. Jon's Defiance\n\nReceived this soap from /u/BALD_and_BEARDLESS as a part of the passaround he proposed in his most recent video. I would say my feelings towards this soap are pretty similar to the ones Josh expressed in his video. The scent was not one I would necessarily be drawn to or one I would seek out, but it did remind me of my childhood. For me the scent memories it retrieved were those of my mother's potpourri. My mom had a very rustic design asthetic in our home as a kid and this involved a lot of potpourri. It was usually faint in my home, but she would also frequently take me on shopping trips, particularly to antique and/or craft stores that would have an overpowering potpourri scent in them. To me, that is the scent this most closely resembles. My sense of smell is not very refined, so I couldn't tell you what aspects of the soap remind me of potpourri, but that's the overall impression that I get. This is by no means a bad smell, it's just not a smell my wife wants to fuck...which is what I look for in a soap.\n\n\nThe soap performed very well. It's a fairly hard puck...maybe not as hard as Pre de Provence (the only hard soap I have) but certainly harder than the soft soaps I'm accustomed to. The soap loaded pretty quickly and lathered easily. The soap burned my skin a bit, but this is not uncommon for me with heavily fragranced soaps and it wasn't irritating enough to disrupt my shave. There was no lasting irritation, as soon as I removed the soap my face felt great. Good protection and post-shave feel.\n\n\nThe aftershave had a nearly identical scent to my nose. I didn't realize it was mentholated, so it was a bit of a surprise when I put it on. It stung a bit more than most aftershave I use, but was not uncomfortable or lasting by any means. The aftershave has a lot of nourishing ingredients in it and left my face feeling nice.\n\n\nI might not buy this particular set from Dr. Jon's, but the performance was good and I adore the artwork, so I will certainly be making a point to purchase a different set from Dr. Jon's in the future.\n\n\nDefiance will be in the mail today to it's next recipient. I look forward to hearing how the rest of the passround goes. Thanks /u/BALD_and_BEARDLESS!\n",

Did two passes, on settings 9 and 6 with the Slim. I swear I accidentally slid the blade horizontally at one point, but somehow didn't cut myself.\n\nDecided I'd pitch the blade after this and start with a fresh one tomorrow. Haven't decided yet if I'll keep playing with this Slim or go back to my RR Baby Smooth for a little while.\n\nHope everybody had a great day today.",

The softness of this knot is still unparalled in my opinion. The black wolf knot is very close but this one is just a tad bit softer.

Cloudy with rain showers throughout the day. High tide at 7:02 this evening.\n\nSkipped the head shave yesterday as it was a very busy morning. Decided to pull out the Maggard's V3 to see how that does on the dome. It performed very well. I took my time, and I like it better for doing my head than either of my injectors, but that might just be practice, and being more comfortable with it.\n\nGetting warmer, so the menthol in the Scale Polish is no longer the deciding factor for using it. My scalp and face feel fantastic. Dapper Dragon ain't nothing to mess with.\n\nHave a nice Tuesday!",

I ordered my soap tour in alpha by manufacturer, but all three of my tube creams came up together. Now my first two soaps from different manufacturers have come up in consecutive order. It doesn't mean anything, I just find things like that interesting. As I mentioned yesterday, my first soap, TOBS Sandalwood did not treat my face very well. I immediately ordered some Chiseled Face and Lather & Wood soaps, but rather than waiting for them to come in to shave again, I picked up this VdH from the local Walgreens to tide me over. I've seen more than one person say that this stuff is just as good if not better than any high end or artisan offering. I'm going to have to politely disagree. It's not terrible. The scent is a generic fresh but clean scent. Nothing interesting, but quite pleasant. It lathers up easily enough, and has decent cushion, but there is barely enough glide to work with. Residual slickness, and post shave feel are quite terrible. This stuff dries my skin out worse than any other soap I've used, and it's not even a close race. I can only think that the people who love this stuff, have oily skin. If you don't have that particular skin situation though, this is not going to do you any favors. The good thing though is that today at least, I could do a full, comfortable three pass shave, so unlike yesterday, today was a normal BBS shave. With the drying soap, today also felt like another good chance to see how the BR post shave could perform. By itself, in the current cooler weather, and with a drying soap, it doesn't feel like quite enough for my skin, but it definitely closed the gap. I see some extra moisturizer in my near future though. Scent pairing on this soap was fairly easy. Just like the VdH, the Gucci has a fresh soapy scent. It's never going to win creativity awards, but I actually enjoy this one from time to time, and its mild and inoffensive in just the right ways to be quite office friendly.\n\n\n\nHave a good one!\n\n\n\n**Soaps**\n\n[<< Taylor of Old Bond Street - Sandalwood](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5xsaix/monday_sotd_thread_mar_06_2017/dekm1gj/)\n\n[Wholly Kaw - Chypre Rose Concerto >>](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5y6xds/wednesday_sotd_thread_mar_08_2017/denrlo8/)\n****\n\n**Tours**\n\n[Razor Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5lefc9/happy_new_year_sotd_thread_jan_01_2017/dbv6f4p/)\n\n[Brush Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5o322q/sunday_sotd_thread_jan_15_2017/dcgf5ud/)\n\n[Soap Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5q99m5/thursday_sotd_thread_jan_26_2017/dcxird1/)\n",

      "body": "Last nights SOTE:\n**Razor**: Schick I2 Hydro-Magic Injector\n**Blade**: Pella\n**Brush**: Semogue 610\n**Soap & Post**: L&L Darkfall\n*****\n\nFirst shave with an injector style razor. I think I liked the 1912 better because it had more audible feedback and the blade seemed to cut easier. But I still liked the I2 more than my previous DEs for closeness of shave. The DEs are way smoother feeling, but I get more enjoyment so far out of the SEs for some reason. Also first time with the Darkfall, it's a nicely balanced smokey scent. Didn't remind me too much of falls in Georgia, but it's a good scent in its own right.",

Their description of *Lavender & Geranium* states that\n\n>This light and subtle combination of Lavender and Geranium carry on the British tradition of understated elegance.\n\nAnd I agree. Out of the tin, the scent of the cream is mostly a light lavender, but when lathered it blooms into a lovely combination of the two notes. Neither overpowers the other, and the lavender and geranium notes work harmoniously. It's a really elegant floral scent that I quite enjoyed.\n\nThe cream is very soft, much like Speick, Proraso and Nivea. It lathers easily, and can take a decent amount of water. I actually under-loaded, which is interesting; it's more product hungry than other creams I've used. It's performance is very good; the lather was slick and protective, although I noticed that it was fairly lacking in both residual slickness and post-shave feel. Neither was exactly bad, but they definitely weren't on par with a lot of the other products I've used. This is by no means a deal-breaker, but worth noting.\n\nStill, it was good enough to help my Tech provide an effortless, irritation-free BBS shave, and one can't ask for much more than that.\n\nHappy Tuesday, all. Up tomorrow is our last cream: Simpson's *Lavender & Vetivert.*\n\n-----\nPrevious | Next\n:-|-:\n[Creams, Game 1: Castle Forbes *Lavender*](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5xsaix/monday_sotd_thread_mar_06_2017/deko87b/) | [Creams, Game 2: Simpson's *Lavender & Vetivert*](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5y6xds/wednesday_sotd_thread_mar_08_2017/denyvgi/)",

So while I enjoyed yesterday's shave (with Stirling's Glacial Lemon Chill) I had no issue with today's shave missing some other scent in addition to just the menthol. Hell, I have a Vick's scented candle.\n\nI'll also say that my severe head cold continues to linger and the Cryogen did help with the congestion a bit more than the Stirling from yesterday.\n\nAs far as the shave soap itself, call me crazy but I think the Stirling was actually \"colder\". The Cryogen lathers beautifully and shaves great but I was a little underwhelmed by the coldness. I think that the effect of the high level of menthol in the Cryogen was hyped up and thus my expectations were too high. Honestly, I think the Lemon Chill from Stirling was just as cold, if not colder.\n\nNow the aftershave tho... this is where Cryogen takes it to another level. The aftershave did seriously induce watery/tearing eyes and added another level of cold that out did the Lemon Chill aftershave. And this was wonderful for the stuffed nasal passages. (Not quite to the effect of too much Chinese hot mustard at once, but close).\n\nThis was also my first time using the CF preshave gel. I had been using the Stirling preshave oil up to this point. I'll keep trying out the gel but I may end up preferring the oil when it's all said and done. Both I think help my shaves but more evaluation of the gel is needed.\n\nThe chill is real!\n\nEDIT: Want to update this about two hours post shave. While I didn't think I had the best shave earlier I have to say this is the absolute smoothest shave I've had yet. A lot of variables to consider though: used CF preshave gel for the first time instead of Stirling's preshave oil, first time using Cryogen or any CFG soap, used a new blade (same brand but new one), continually improving technique?, etc.",

I tried Castle Forbes Lime shaving cream which is really great stuff - great slickness, cushion, residual, and post shave feel. I used Stirling MITA which had a great scent of margaritas with some menthol, but irritated my skin. I washed it off and tried a sample of Trumper Limes Skin Food. Not great. It felt like glycerin and didn't absorb, so I washed that off. Then I went to an old favorite Dominica Bay Rum (with Limes) and Soap Commander Respect, which worked mo' better!",

Proraso white to my nose smells likes freshly cut grass, but that doesn't bother me. It's slick, easy to lather, performs very well and inexpensive. The post-shave feel has never bothered me, I always have good AS to fall back to. My shave doesn't feel complete without the nice aftershave balm.\n\n\nI love the Blackbird for it's efficiency but my skin feels well rested with the S1, while still performing with acceptable efficiency. I think I'll be sticking with this razor for a week or two. I'm getting pretty bored with the BlackBird (weird I know) and it's nice to rediscover forgotten goodies.",

Being a rose forward soap, in one of my favorite bases, Chypre Rose Concerto rises quite high on my list of favorite soaps. It's a very bright and fresh scent, perfect for spring time.

I still think it dries too fast and it's not setting the world on fire with its scent, but it does the job well and doesn't react badly to my skin. Lathers decently, too, although as I've mentioned, it dries much quicker than I'd like.\n\nDecided to try out Feather again. I haven't used the Hi Stainless since I first started a few months ago because they cut my face pretty badly. Realising that the cuts were likely due to poor technique and prep, I decided another go at them was a good idea. And it was. I now see why people like Feather blades so much. It's efficient; it doesn't cut me; and while it's not my most comfortable shave, it's not a waste of metal as I previously thought.\n\nThe Issey Miyake Nuit is a surprisingly good balm. While it's more alcoholic than I'd like, I prefer no alcohol at all frankly, it's not irritating and it adds to the fragrance of the EdT and body wash. While I can't afford his clothes, it's nice to at least smell like one of his models.\n\nEDIT: oh, about the interviews I mentioned last week. I got a job at the big four.",

The past few days I shaved with vintage SEs so I took a break and went back to DE today. It doesn't get the same first pass closeness as the SE, but it is smooth and fast and I like that. I was able to get a 2.5 pass DFS in next to no time with no nicks or irritation. The razor itself is quite a small little thing, along the same size as a 1912, and maneuvered well. The one weird thing about it is that the blade itself sticks out the sides of the razor (not the sharp edges, but middle wider part). Not a fan but I could live with it. It does give great audible feedback though and I quite like that. Not sure I would buy one given the vendor, but I wouldn't mind owning one I don't think. I'll definitely be giving this one more shaves. Thanks again drc!\nOh also this was my third spin with Night Music and I was on the fence before, but I think I'll keep it for now.",

First use of L&L and Tallow and Steel and my first use of a silvertip brush. I really enjoyed the Marshland soap; easy lather, slick, protective and with a great scent. The Tallow and Steel complemented the soap wonderfully and has great post shave feel. I really enjoyed using the brush; the handle has a nice feel, it's a perfect size for face lathering and lots of backbone. Very different from my synthetics but worth getting nailed down. All in all it was a great way to start the day. Have a great day folks!",

The vetiver gives the lavender an awesome, dirty, green quality that starts out a bit green in the tin, but really comes into its own in the lather. It smolders; I freaking love it. I don't really like it more than *Lavender & Geranium,* per se, but it definitely has its own thing going on.\n\nPerformance-wise, it seems to be a bit better than the St. James. The slickness and protection is about the same, but the Simpson cream felt like it had better residual slickness and post-shave feel.\n\nOr at least I thought it did, until I rinsed off at the end of my shave and my face promptly broke out in fucking hives! WTF! In a shocking turn of events, Simpson fouls out of the game! St. James of London advances to the quarter-finals, where it will face the breakout star Speick!\n\nFolks, in this tournament, anything can happen. Stay tuned tomorrow for the start of the Big 4 division, where we'll have a last-minute substitution to shake things up even further on Sunday!\n\n-----\nPrevious | Next\n:-|-:\n[Creams, Game 2: St. James of London *Lavender & Geranium*](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5xzduc/tuesday_sotd_thread_mar_07_2017/demb7na/) | [Big 4, Game 1: Barrister & Mann *Latha Lavanda*](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5ye2kp/thursday_sotd_thread_mar_09_2017/depg8t6/)",

I started with it on a 9 for the first pass, and boy did I feel the blade. Progressed down through 7 and 5 for the next two passes. The shave was not the most comfortable during it, and I expected the Alum to be a little brutal, but surprisingly I felt just the slightest tingle.\n\nStill resting my neck. The red bumps which have been present just about since my first wetshaving attempt ~2 months ago are almost done healing. I'm hoping that my technique has improved enough that once they're healed, I can prevent them from coming back. They've been there so long because I kept shaving with them there, not giving my neck enough time to heal.\n\nUnintentionally cold post-shave routine with three mentholated products in there - eyes are watering about 10-15 min after leaving the bathroom now lol.\n\nHope everybody has a good shave and a good day :)",

Fairly minimal scent to it but clean smelling. Don't presently have the matching AS so I opted for the CRUX since both it and the soap have a bergamot base. Love the CRUX scent. Recommend checking it out in person if you can.\n\nI shaved a bit quicker than usual but no immediate irritation issues. Hopefully that will be the same a few hours from now.\n\nEnjoy the day!",

I was going to use the S1, but changed my mind. The Timeless .68 reminds me of the performance of the ATT S1, maybe slightly more efficient. I have to use it for a week before I really get a handle on it. Revisiting has seldom failed me, that's for sure.\n\n\nThe cream was just fantastic. It's one of my most inexpensive, if not my most inexpensive, and yet it's one of the best if not my best cream.\n\n\nWashing my face after the end of the shave took more time because of the risidual slickness.\n\n\nScent is almost nonexistent but the performance and value of this cream never fails to surprise me.

You barely need any to get 3 passes of lather, the cushion level is quite good, and the scent is simple and clean.\n\nThis Atelier is interesting. Tea, spices, and citrus. Will append my thoughts after wearing for a few hours.\n\nPS - Happy Mug has the best logo:\n\n- http://imgur.com/KOBjgQv\n- http://imgur.com/1lZKPUD",

Today was the first go with the new razor. I find that the head has slightly more weight to it than my Wolfman. The efficiency of the razor is on par with that of the Wolfman though, it's really smooth. My recommendation would be that if anyone is ready to give up hope on snagging a Wolfman surf on over to Timeless and buy something that is readily available. Full disclosure, I did not buy a handle from Timeless, therefore I cannot comment on the differences.",

I forgot how ridiculous local anaesthetic makes your face feel. The receptionist was French, so I was trying my best to converse with her in that language, but my accent was a little too drooly to be understood with part of my face not responding. I guess I was going for the authentic Jean Chretien look.",

Excellent. It's easily in the top ring of soaps in performance. The soap is a little thirsty but the cushion, glide, and post shave felt excellent. It reminds me a lot of B&M White label. The base even looks like it too....\n\nT+S Classic is supposed to be Ryan's barbershop soap. Top notes to me are vetiver and lavender. Secondary notes to me are bergamot, more lavender, and rosemary. I'm not getting a lot of the anise or oakmoss and to be honest I don't think I would be ever able to pick out patchouli in a soap. The scent is very lavender and vetiver heavy to me. It's smokey. It's a great scent.",

This match is some clash of the titans stuff, between two of our beloved artisan soap makers: Barrister & Mann and Mickey Lee. This is going to be a hard won battle since these are two of my favorite soap bases. The good news is that since I've used both, I'll be able to make an informed decision about them.\n\nSo, *Latha Lavanda.* In Will's own words:\n\n>This is an honestly good lavender soap.\n\nAnd he ain't whistlin' Dixie. This soap is flat-out great. The *Latha* base is one of my all-around favorite no muss, no fuss soap bases, and its performance stacks up against anything else out there. To iterate:\n\n* Protectivity: *check.*\n* Slickness: *check.*\n* Residual slickness: *check.*\n* Post-shave feel: *check.*\n* Kitchen sink: *Nah...Latha doesn't need that fancy schmancy stuff.*\n\nThe scent is straight, unadulterated lavender. Honestly good lavender. It's soft, elegant, simple and just great. The scent opens up and blooms like a good scotch when it's lathered, but other than that doesn't change between the tub and the lather.\n\nNo shenanigans this morning, just a damn good shave with a damn good setup. Looking forward to seeing how *Jefferson Square* compares tomorrow, because I know it's going to be good, too. Tomorrow being Friday doesn't hurt, either.\n\n-----\nPrevious | Next\n:-|-:\n[Creams, Game 2: Simpson's *Lavender & Vetivert*](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5y6xds/wednesday_sotd_thread_mar_08_2017/denyvgi/) | [Big 4, Game 1: Mickey Lee Soapworks *Jefferson Square*](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5yl462/friday_sotd_thread_mar_10_2017/der0pkk/)",

I was pretty please when she picked US, and commented on how good it smelled. When I first had her smell it, she was unimpressed. I welcome this change, as I love the stuff.\n\nIt was my last shave with the Parker Variant before I pack it up to ship off to the next person in the passaround. Thanks again to /u/dendj55 for lending it out. Overall, the Variant is a very nice razor. Though I probably won't be buying one for myself, I would highly recommend this razor to someone in the earlier stages of wetshaving addicition. I can see the stainless and adjustable nature of the Variant making it a good competitor for razors like the Rockwell 6S. It's got great weight, and balance, and is a very smooth shaver, even on its aggressive settings. I never did crank it quite up to 5, but got pretty close. I also really like that the adjustability is continuous, not quantized like it is on vintage Gillettes.",

First time using a straight which I got courtesy of /u/goldragon it was a little intimidating. I got a pretty good shave not the closest due to my timid hands. I got a few little nicks but nothing major. Definitely enjoyed the shave and can see how awesome using a SR would be once perfected. Felt pretty awesome after using it I have to admit. Hope everyone's shaves were as exciting as mine.\n\n\nEdit: actually used a Thater 4125/0 as my brush",

I found it in almost pristine shape at a local antique mall for $7. I'll post a pic later; it is amazingly clean. There was some small irritation but less than I expected with a new razor a day after a very rough shave (I tried some foolish experimentation). I should've let it heal, but I lathered up my Lavanille for fun and just couldn't resist taking advantage of such a gorgeous lather. I think I actually prefer the old formula to the glissant base...\n\n",

The scent on this one is woody, not too dark, not too light, middle of the road niceness. The post shave face feel is great, no dryness at all. It's moderately priced at $19 a tub, so it's competitive with most of the current top artisans. I think I need to pick some of this up! It paired nicely IMO with Reunion too, yay vetiver!\n\nOverall a DFS, and a gorgeous day to boot...woohoo!!!\n\nTo add, I had a great time last night with /u/Tiglathpilesar and family, /u/chill31613 and family, /u/Eric--M , /u/Sammy_Lee /u/Mickey_Lee and family.

BB is still my favorite but this razor has a lot of potential with my skin. I'm no longer chasing the ultra BBS, so I'm pretty satisfied.\n\n\nThe soap is nice, it's perfect for those with sensitive skin or has sensitive nose cause the scent is almost nonexistent. The lather is \"almost\" as rich as Haslinger sheep but that one is just really special.\n\n\nBrush is excellent, if you love synthetics, give this knot a try, I think you can also get this knot with other artisans.\n\n\nCL's Catalan Prairie is probably his most pleasant scent. It's robust in it's own way, and yet pleasant enough for easily cloyed fellas like me to enjoy.\n\n\nVoskhod is starting to skip a bit but I'm OCD and stubborn, I think I'll change it on Monday.

Can't really figure out the smell. Maybe a sweet mint? Anyway doesn't really matter. This first one is very soft. Almost cream like. Lather was pretty impressive. Could handle water well enough. Overall a very good shave. A touch drying but that's easy enough to deal with.\n\nThe hardware is courtesy of /u/HMNbean the Lucite handle is awesome looking. Really surprised at how well the Timeless is made. Finishing is perfect. If it was a little smaller then I'd be all over it.\n\n[L'OCCITAN](http://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/L-Occitane-en-Provence/L-Occitan-Eau-de-Toilette-2226.html) is in my opinion the best spicy lavender scent. Perfect for any time of year. As with anything from L'Occitane it's quality stuff at a fair price. Just go by some. At least the Balm because it's the tits.",

Mickey Lee's work is among the best I've used, and their new base (which is over a year old at this point) is outstanding. It checks all the same boxes that *Latha* checks, and other than slickness & protection, each of those is slightly improved over Will's *Latha* line. I absolutely can't differentiate the slickness between the two. Mickey Lee does provide *slightly* more residual slickness and better post-shave feel. It also throws in the kitchen sink, because it *is* the fancy schmancy stuff.\n\nMuch like *Latha Lavanda's* scent, *Jefferson Square* is straight-up, unadulterated lavender. Where it differs is that it's a blend of four different lavender essential oils. Because of this, its bouquet has much more depth and effects a couple of different spicy notes. I'm a fan of more complex scents, so *Jefferson Square's* bouquet appeals to me a bit more than the simpler lavender of *Latha Lavanda,* which is also an excellent scent.\n\nAs I'm re-reading this write-up, it reads like the match is much more in *Jefferson Square's* favor than it actually was. This pretty much came down to scent preference. Every aspect of *Latha Lavanda* is 100% quality, and literally everything that one needs in a shave soap. *Jefferson Square* does deliver a little extra, but performance-wise I'd been perfectly content with either of these bases. Scent-wise, I definitely prefer *Jefferson Square,* and so it moves on to the quarter-finals.\n\nHappy Friday, all! Tomorrow's shave ain't going to be nothing to mess with.\n\n-----\nPrevious | Next\n:-|-:\n[Big 4, Game 1: Barrister & Mann *Latha Lavanda*](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5ye2kp/thursday_sotd_thread_mar_09_2017/depg8t6/) | [Big 4, Game 2: Dapper Dragon *Lavender Lizard*](http://reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5yruxs/saturday_sotd_thread_mar_11_2017/desvrqx)",

It's a beautiful razor, built nicely and feels very good in the hand. Cut myself twice and experienced a hell of a lot of tugging and pulling. At many points the razor wouldn't cut unless I applied pressure I wasn't comfortable with. I did have four day's growth though. Near the end I managed to reduce the tugging by experimenting with angle but I wasn't consistent. Pretty smooth shave but experienced irritation and missed some spots on my neck and below my jaw. I used my right hand to shave both sides and this worked fine most of the time but I had trouble with some spots, hopefully I'll settle in soon. I'd say it went ok since the result is fine, the process leaves a lot to be desired though.\n\n",

It's on the milder side, but perfect for pairing up with any vetiver fragrances. Today I decided to go with the classic Vetiver from Guerlain.\n\nThis was the last soap in the originally scheduled soap tour, however tomorrow it will continue with an epilogue consisting of the LE and discontinued soaps I've acquired since the first of the year, in the order I received them. First up will be B & M Night Music.\n\n\n\nHave a good one!\n\n\n\n**Soaps**\n\n[<< Wholly Kaw - Cuero Oscuro](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5ye2kp/thursday_sotd_thread_mar_09_2017/depg9rl/)\n\n[Barrister & Mann - Night Music >>](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5yruxs/saturday_sotd_thread_mar_11_2017/deskf2t/)\n****\n\n**Tours**\n\n[Razor Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5lefc9/happy_new_year_sotd_thread_jan_01_2017/dbv6f4p/)\n\n[Brush Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5o322q/sunday_sotd_thread_jan_15_2017/dcgf5ud/)\n\n[Soap Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5q99m5/thursday_sotd_thread_jan_26_2017/dcxird1/)\n",

It is the third one I got when I started. My first soap was Proraso white which I got at SDM, before I knew about this community and the wet shaving stores like ME, etc. My second was a TOBS cream, followed by Lavanille which I heard about when I was a lurker in the old wetshaving sub. It has become my favorite soap, and I have now started to see the bottom of the tub. Some time in 2017, I'll need to get another tub of Lavanille.",

The menthol felt like it had a bit of a burning sensation initially and then quickly went to a cooling sensation. The feather was pretty agressive, I nicked myself once but overall it was a solid performer. The nick was entirely my fault and maybe shaving with a feather will force me to get better technique.\n\n\nDoes anyone else experience a bit of a burning sensation with the menthol initially? Or is it more likely an allergic reaction?",

I went with some mild scents, pleasant and comforting. Cade cream great lather, doesn't have the post shave feel I love, although I'll probably stuff a bunch into a squeeze tube for travel and get the balm in l'occitane because smoky lavender is the dope. Whatever that greenness in the LQV is right up my alley, anybody have some fragrance recommendations for pairing? Talked with the department Supervisor about my interview, he's saying the manager was impressed and I have a good shot. The other guy is company which complicates back filling his position, not a ton of talent in the Oklahoma panhandle. It's a precarious position and I'm not betting the farm on it, but so far, so good.",

Still going strong, and smooth. The SIM stick is normally stored in my dopp kit, but when I saw Penhaligon's EF I thought that might be a nice pairing. And nice it is indeed -- my face feels like a million bucks (or Deutsche Marks, or Stirling Pounds).\n\nThis morning I'm taking my girls out for breakfast. There's that busy, retro diner they love not far from the house, with pictures and frames of movies from the 70s and 80s that my wife and I watched as a kid. Breakfast Club, Back to the Future, Weekend at Bernies, The Goonies, E.T., Risky Business,... Last time we went it convinced them they needed to watch the entire Back to the Future franchise. Bonus points for daddy: their bacon is amazing, and two of the staff members are two sisters - both younger and hotter clones of Catherine Zeta-Jones, showing up for work in their Lululemon yoga outfit.\n\nHappy Saturday everyone.",

With all the talk about it over the last year, I knew there was no way I was going to miss my opportunity to pick up Night Music when it showed up on the release schedule for this year. Even though I hadn't sampled it, I picked up it up blind; soap, splash and two bottles of the EdT. While I haven't had the chance to use the soap until now, I've been getting regular use out of the EdT. I love the fragrance from the EdT. I also like the extra musk scent that comes off the soap. No questions about pairings for today. Full stack all the way, and it was absolutely fabulous.\n\n\n\nHave a good one!\n\n\n\n**Soaps**\n\n[<< Wholly Kaw - Vetivertal](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5yl462/friday_sotd_thread_mar_10_2017/der2255/)\n\n[Barrister & Mann - Latha >>](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5yxvth/sunday_sotd_thread_mar_12_2017/detxqj8/)\n****\n\n**Tours**\n\n[Razor Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5lefc9/happy_new_year_sotd_thread_jan_01_2017/dbv6f4p/)\n\n[Brush Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5o322q/sunday_sotd_thread_jan_15_2017/dcgf5ud/)\n\n[Soap Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5q99m5/thursday_sotd_thread_jan_26_2017/dcxird1/)\n",

I'm fairly new to wet shaving so I thought I'd check out /u/dendj55 's face lathering tutorial and boy did it make a difference! I usually make a decent lather, but for whatever reason, this one was just the step above. Many thanks Ruds!\n\nHave a good one folks, it's a long weekend for me!",

Irritation free, no hassle BBS shave in 3 passes. The brush is a beauty matches perfectly with the razor, but I still need work on using a 30mm but it was pretty good today. The Blade is back to being smooth as ever so I think this one will at least push 20. Now I got 3 mystery samples from /u/praise_the_fireborn and after smelling all 3 I only could tell what one was and it's cause I asked to try it. I believe this sample was Vide Poche and it smelled amazing. If I'm correct it is my first time using a T+S soap and I'm definitely impressed very slick and great post shave feel, even more excited for Shag. Hope everyone has a great weekend and some great shaves.",

Being the 3rd of the \"known quantity\" soap bases, I already knew that this would perform excellently (and it did).\n\nI hadn't previously used this scent, though. Out of the tub, *Lavender Lizard* is a mildly sweet lavender with a faint tinge of vanilla. It's pleasant enough, but it really comes into its own when lathered. Upon lathering, both the lavender and vanilla notes soften and expand into a lovely, soothing blend. I also detect a powdery note in there somewhere.\n\nThis is a great scent. It's definitely on the more relaxing end of the lavender spectrum. The powdery note gives it a sort of elegance as well. *Lavender Lizard* goes up against our last minute substitution, Martin de Candre *Original,* tomorrow. That should be an interesting match.\n\n-----\nPrevious | Next\n:-|-:\n[Big 4, Game 1: Mickey Lee *Jefferson Square*](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5yl462/friday_sotd_thread_mar_10_2017/der0pkk) | [Big 4, Game 2: Martin de Candre *Original*](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5yxvth/sunday_sotd_thread_mar_12_2017/detz2iy)",

The color is unusual, I'm assuming due to the activated charcoal but it hits all the requirements for a good soap; easy to lather, protective and slick. The mild scent is also a plus for me.\n\n\nIt's been a week Voskhod, time to say good bye, but you surprised me. Fresh one coming on Monday.\n\n\nBrush is great, and for the price, it's surprisingly well made. It has a good backbone, soft tips but the brush over all at $11-12 bucks, is not off kilter, no bald spot on the middle, no chips on the handle, the logo has held up. It's great.\n\n\nHope everyone is having a great weekend.",

During the Barrister & Mann AMA, it was mentioned that the original Latha was not coming back into production, so I decided to pick up a tub while it was still available. Anyone else curious to get one before they are all gone, can still pick one up from either Amazon or Merchant & Rhoades. The scent on this one is billed as a form of barbershop. Lavender, oakmoss and heliotrope are the scent notes. While I think the lack of tonka/coumarin means it's not technically a fougère, it is definitely leans toward that fougère area of the barbershop spectrum, but at the same time the vanilla and almond aspects of the heliotrope pull in almost an Italian barbershop direction. Two worlds of barbershop colliding so to speak. Lavender heavy fragrances, especially fougères will probably be good candidates for pairing. Pour un Homme de Caron would probably be nice as well. Today though, I was in the mood for the aromatic and woody elements from Grey Flannel. While it has no lavender, it has the tonka bean to complete the fougère motif, creating a nice complement.\n\n\n\nHave a good one!\n\n\n\n**Soaps**\n\n[<< Barrister & Mann - Night Music](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5yruxs/saturday_sotd_thread_mar_11_2017/deskf2t/)\n\n[Coate's Shaving Cream - Original Almond >>](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5z40pe/monday_sotd_thread_mar_13_2017/dev7dco/)\n****\n\n**Tours**\n\n[Razor Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5lefc9/happy_new_year_sotd_thread_jan_01_2017/dbv6f4p/)\n\n[Brush Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5o322q/sunday_sotd_thread_jan_15_2017/dcgf5ud/)\n\n[Soap Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5q99m5/thursday_sotd_thread_jan_26_2017/dcxird1/)\n",

[*Conquest*](https://www.drjonshandcraftedsoapco.com/collections/dr-jons-natural-vegan-shaving-soap/products/dr-jons-conquest-natural-vegan-shaving-soap-vol-2) is a sandalwood/blackberry based scent.

I get mainly the lavender and not much mint. It's Thayers, so it's good for you. Great shave this morning with the Perma-Sharp on shave seven. Very smooth. Great Sunday shaves to all.

Single Edge (#3 Plate) w/Chinese Schick blade (10).*\n***Post-Shave:*** *Extra lather, cold water splashes, Thayer's* Lavender *Witch Hazel, L'Occitane* L'Occitan *Post-Shave Balm.*\n***Soundtrack:*** Radio Music Society *by Esperanza Spalding.*\n\n\n\n#####*Big 4, Game 2:* Dapper Dragon Lavender Lizard *vs.* Martin de Candre Original\n\nDue to generosity, we had a last minute substitution in the Big 4 division. Therefore, Martin de Candre *Original* is competing in place of Sapone di Paolo *Piccante.* Thanks to /u/whiskyey for the sample!\n\nMdC *Original* is a lovely scent. Out of the tub the lavender note is definitely strongest, though there's also a hint of rosemary in there. When lathered, the rosemary mellows a bit and lends the lavender a nice herbal quality rather than standing out on its own. I can't detect any mint at all, though it's supposed to be one of the scent notes. I'm a little stuffy this mouthing, so that could be the reason.\n\nSpeaking of lather, this soap is excellent in that respect as well. It loads so quickly that it reminded me of its countryman, **CADE** Rich Cream. 15 seconds of loading provided enough lather for two or three shaves. It also performs comparably to **CADE**.\n\nIn terms of slickness and protection, it also matches *Lavender Lizard.* It may even be slightly slicker than the Dapper Dragon base. It doesn't seem to have the same level of residual slickness as Dapper Dragon, however. MdC's post-shave feel doesn't seem to be quite as good as Dapper Dragon, either.\n\nMartin de Candre is an excellent soap, and based on today's first impression, is worthy of a permanent spot in my den (though I'll likely buy the fougère since I'm up to my ears in lavender soaps right now). I feel that *Lavender Lizard* edges it out in the supporting aspects of performance. I also like its scent a bit more than MdC's.\n\nAfter a very close match, Dapper Dragon proves that it still ain't nothing to mess with. We'll see *Lavender Lizard* face off against *Jefferson Square* for the Big 4 division title in 9 days.\n\n-----\nPrevious | Next\n:-|-:\n[Big 4, Game 2: Dapper Dragon *Lavender Lizard*](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5yruxs/saturday_sotd_thread_mar_11_2017/desvrqx) | [Complex Blends, Game 1: Soap Smooth *Riez*](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5z40pe/monday_sotd_thread_mar_13_2017/devcgsi/)",

This Van Yulay stuff is pretty nice - good slickness and post-shave feel. It comes in a weird little muffin shape, so it was a bit annoying to squish it into a tin for loading. The scent is very citrusy, but not sweet - I mostly get grapefruit with maybe a bit of bergamot.\n\nPicked up a bottle of Thayer's recently and definitely like how it performs - may pick up some scented ones in the future. Much nicer than the drug store witch hazel, which I find quite drying and unpleasant smelling.",

Sudsy Soapery were really awesome for the Seattle Shave Con last year and threw in a fairly large sample tin container as part of the grab bag. Scooped out a few dabs and smashed them on the bottom on my bowl and went to town. Lathered up really easily to a nice yogurt consistency and the peppermint wasn't too overwhelming, kind of left a nice mild coolness to my face as I shaved. Overall some really great shaving soap, I've been looking at picking up some of the White Sage and Lime. Nice day of relaxing with some lavender smells from Vide Poche.",

Not today. This morning, everything came together and I *really* experienced what Glissant is all about. It absolutely excelled in every conceivable manner. I hope that I will be able to replicate this on a more consistent basis. A very nice way to start the work week.\n\nEnjoy your shave, and your day.",

I picked up all six scent options for less than $13 shipped. They are definitely smaller tubes, 1.7 oz (50 ml) tubes. Perfect for sampling this long discontinued product. After using it, I can see why this particular cream had a devoted following. Performance was very good. The properties on the lather were very similar to Castle Forbes. The scent though, was basically non-existent. I'm not sure how much that has to do with being 10+ years old, or just minimal almond scenting, or some combination, but I could actually smell the badger hair on my brush more than the soap. It made pairing easy enough, since nothing will pair with anything. I've been wanting another wear of this Prada, which is a fascinating beast. It opens as a spicy warm amber and transforms in dry down to a patchouli, soapy almost barbershop scent. Very good stuff.\n\n\n\nHave a good one!\n\n\n\n**Soaps**\n\n[<< Barrister & Mann - Latha](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5yxvth/sunday_sotd_thread_mar_12_2017/detxqj8/)\n\n[Coate's Shaving Cream - Original Lavender >>](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5zb2zf/tuesday_sotd_thread_mar_14_2017/dewsx87/)\n****\n\n**Tours**\n\n[Razor Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5lefc9/happy_new_year_sotd_thread_jan_01_2017/dbv6f4p/)\n\n[Brush Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5o322q/sunday_sotd_thread_jan_15_2017/dcgf5ud/)\n\n[Soap Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5q99m5/thursday_sotd_thread_jan_26_2017/dcxird1/)\n",

I'm looking at a timeless or maybe complete my collection of Semogue brushes.\n\nI originally wrote off Derby blades because they didn't work for me in the 34c. I popped one in my Rockwell and man what a difference. So smooth i had to check if the blade was cutting. Extremely happy with the fact these blades are one of the cheaper ones.

I just prefer the feel of natural hair, I'm not overly fond of the springiness, the caties bubbles is a warm scent that really mellows you out and clears your head. I wish great a shaves to all, and hope you have a good start to your weeks.... it's time for mine to begin.",

Either way, it is a fantastic scent. I do pick out some grass in there. Why my mind went right to *Summer Storm* as a good match. We are under a WINTER ADVISORY for NE Ohio. Last night it stated 5-9 inches of snow. This morning that has been reduced to 4-7. Just lovely. Must be Monday. Great shaves to all.",

It would be unfair for me to judge this soap after only one use, but I did get a very nice shave. It wasn't as drying as I feared it might be either. Ther residual slickness isn't as much as other soaps I have, both artisanal and commercial, but it is extremely easy to lather. And it makes a very nice lather. Given this soap's reputation for longevity, I suspect I'll get ar least a dozen shaves from this sample.\n\nI hit 65 shaves on the Polsilver today. This is crazy. I've never gotten this far with a blade before. Now my boredom has been overtaken by my curiosity. How far can it possibly go? I hate Mondays.",

Realize it's probably a cooler/cold seasonal scent, but we've had another cold few days in GA, so I figured it wouldn't hurt. Performance was the usual MLS performance, very nice. The scent is definitely in-your-face. It's pleasant, but I bet it could come off a little alcohol heavy for some people. I don't think my gf will like it very much.",

Cashmere in a G_Huck stonewood burl beehive handle.*\n***Razor:*** *Star DE w/Gillette 7 O'Clock SharpEdge blade (5).*\n***Post-Shave:*** *Extra lather, cold water splashes, Thayer's* Lavender *Witch Hazel, L'Occitane* L'Occitan *Post-Shave Balm.*\n***Soundtrack:*** *Early Morning Silence.*\n\n\n\n#####*Complex/Woody Blends, Game 1:* Soap Smooth Riez *vs.* Czech & Speake Oxford & Cambridge\nWe're firmly back into unknown territory with this morning's shave. Soap Smooth is an artisan that I'd never used before today, which always makes it exciting. *Riez* is a vegan soap whose scent profile is comprised of the same notes as Martin de Candre *Original:* Lavender, rosemary and mint. It would have been interesting to see these two compete against one another, but oh well; I didn't want to muck about with the bracket to that extent when I added MdC to it.\n\nThough the profile is the same, the scents themselves are quite different. I couldn't detect any mint in MdC, but it's prevalent in *Riez.* So much, in fact, that it nearly overpowers the rest of the bouquet. Out of the tub, all I can detect is the mint. Once the soap is lathered, the lavender and rosemary come into it, but they're definitely more of a muted lavender with vague herbal qualities and a lot of peppermint.\n\nBecause of the peppermint's boldness, the lather is also quite invigorating. The soap also performs quite well, being very slick and easy to load/lather. It lacks somewhat in residual slickness, but does have a nice post-shave feel. It goes up against Czech & Speake tomorrow, and if Valobra's reputation is deserved it should be a good match. Happy Monday, all!\n\n-----\nPrevious | Next\n:-|-:\n[Big 4, Game 2: Martin de Candre *Original*](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5yxvth/sunday_sotd_thread_mar_12_2017/detz2iy/) | [Complex Blends, Game 1: Czech & Speake *Oxford & Cambridge*](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5zb2zf/tuesday_sotd_thread_mar_14_2017/dewvtjx/)\n",

(Sorry) my girlfriend bought me this shaving cream from AoS. It smells greats! It's my first Oud scent, but I have read this one is very popular. I know that AoS gets a lot of flak, but this cream is actually really good! The cream built into a very thick and slick lather with minimal effort.\n\nI was able to get a great BBS shave. The Classic splash complemented the scent well. But this scent is so good I think I might pick up the matching balm.\n\nOn another note, Im going to disneyland today! But in the mean time I am stuck at the Ford Dealership for a check engine light Have a great day guys!",

Great slickness and post-shave feel, but yea essentially an unscented cream at this point.\n\nI must have had some weird lapse of technique on the right side of my face, as it stung a little bit even just splashing water on it between passes 1 and 2, and I nicked myself on my face (vs. my neck) for the first time. Not a lot of blood or anything, just weird. Almost hit it with the Alum, but decided that would burn too much lol.\n\nMy shave felt great otherwise - I don't think the blade is to blame or anything, though if I have more problems tomorrow, I'll probably toss it.\n\nHope everybody has a good shave and a good day!

I guess considering their age, I didn't expect their performance to be so good. The Lavender today had the same good performance as yesterday, but with a bonus today of actual scent. It's a nice crisp lavender, slightly on the camphorous side. Milder on the scent than a lot of the artisan offerings, but perfect if you don't want to interfere with a fragrance. Pair it up with pretty much anything lavender based, and you're good to go. Today I felt like some F by Ferragamo Black, so that's where I went.\n\n\n\nHave a good one!\n\n\n\n**Soaps**\n\n[<< Coate's Shaving Cream - Original Almond](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5z40pe/monday_sotd_thread_mar_13_2017/dev7dco/)\n\n[Coate's Shaving Cream - Superior Lime >>](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5zi4e9/wednesday_sotd_thread_mar_15_2017/deyhdb4/)\n****\n\n**Tours**\n\n[Razor Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5lefc9/happy_new_year_sotd_thread_jan_01_2017/dbv6f4p/)\n\n[Brush Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5o322q/sunday_sotd_thread_jan_15_2017/dcgf5ud/)\n\n[Soap Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5q99m5/thursday_sotd_thread_jan_26_2017/dcxird1/)\n",

It has that loud blade resonance typical of unsupported blade razors (Wardonia, Rapira, pre-War Tech) but for some reason, it's not as efficient. Like the NEW SC, it's probably due to the blade though.",

It loaded light, lathered like a champ, held water like a camel, and was so slick it nearly fell off of my face.\n\nI also don't think I had it dialed in quite properly. I feel like it could have used even more water than I added to it, and that may have helped its residual slickness (which was good but not great) a bit. It had good post-shave feel as well.\n\nThe scent is a nice, soft lavender blend which contains mint, rosemary, bergamot and oakmoss. I can only really detect the lavender and oakmoss. Maybe a hint of citrus, but it's very well blended with the rest. I think I need to spend more time with it.\n\nWhich I'll do, because based on its scent and performance today, it handily defeated Soap Smooth, and so it moves on to the quarter-finals/division championships.\n\nWe'll see it going up against the winner of our next match, First Canadian's *Hot Summer Lavender* vs. LASSCo's *Woody Lavender,* which starts tomorrow.\n\n-----\nPrevious | Next\n:-|-:\n[Complex Blends, Game 1: Soap Smooth *Riez*](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5z40pe/monday_sotd_thread_mar_13_2017/devcgsi/) | [Complex Blends, Game 2: First Canadian Shave Soap Co. *Hot Summer Lavender*](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5zi4e9/wednesday_sotd_thread_mar_15_2017/deylqjp/)",

I finally got around to changing my rotation. I have been shaving with the heavier and warmer scents since October and I feel more drawn to brighter or cologne based soaps now.\n\nThe Astra was new on Saturday but it just didn't feel right today so and it only had two shaves on it, Saturday and Monday. The Personna felt a little better so I can only assume yesterdays shave wasn't as good and I am working with some irritation on my face.\n\nI do need to get a \"sacrificial\" badger for Night Music and Lavanille simply because I don't want to stain my only badger now. I have been eyeing the Stirling badger but just haven't pulled the trigger yet.\n\nEdit: I want to take a moment to make sure Stirling Soaps doesn't interpret my words as \"I think poorly of their hardware\". I have heard great praise of their badger and I look forward to getting one.",

Simply superb.\n\nNow, the Ti BBS-1. My first go with a titanium razor. I typically do better with heavier, stainless steel razors. But this baby is so well balanced you hardly feel the weight difference. I'd need my SS BBS-1 to do a side by side comparison (part of the passaround) but either way you can't go wrong with any BBS-1 razor.\n\nSchools are closed (at least for the day, and I expect tomorrow as well) so I'm home with my princesses.

I was caught by surprise by just how cold this is, and without the actual smell of menthol. To me it smells like mint, with the slightest hint of peppermint, and no menthol. Going by smell I figured it would be *cool*, not *cold*...I was wrong. It's not Cryogen or Arctique cold, but is NOT far behind. The sensation was nice, and performance was once again top notch. I'll be buying some of these soon. Very good stuff IMO!!!",

My Feather blade started tugging badly Sunday (after 3 shaves), so I replaced it with a blade that deserves its omnipresence. Nice smooth shave.\n\nThe balm however, is horrible. Irritates my skin something horrible for about twenty minutes. It's fine after that, but it doesn't half hurt until then.\n\nThe sun is finally out here, so I'm moving into a nice spring fragrance with the original Eau D'Issey. Nice citrusy hit.",

Almost a styptic in a gel form. It's, well, odd. Sort of numbs the spot a little, certainty gets rid of the red and bleeding right quick. Not sure I'd use it again.",

It's incredibly head heavy and has a very thin handle. The blade is held totally flat which would have you believe it's going to be very aggressive, however, on the contrary, it's actually very mild. Too mild in fact (for me at least). Hence the shim. With the slightest extra blade gap this razor excels for me. As an added bonus it's beautiful. The top cap, which covers the ends of the blade, is as aesthetically pleasing as they are innovative.\n\nThe Thäter is a brush I lusted over for a long while before having the opportunity to purchase it. It is surprisingly good at face lathering despite its size and the backbone is pleasant considering it's a 3 band.\n\nAdagio continues to be one of my favourite B&M soaps. Sweet and refreshing in perfect proportions.\n\nAnyhow, have a good day everybody :)",

The loading method for the blade was pretty cool, though I was nervous about messing up the blade as I did it. I was very surprised at how smooth it was, and it gives great feedback. Thanks /u/Fahrenheit915 !\n\nWe are dogsitting this week which was great timing with the snowstorm. It ended up not being nearly as bad as the estimates were for our area but it was still way more snow than we've seen in a while, and especially for March. The dog hasn't been letting me sleep much so I have been needing to double down on the Yirgacheffe this week.\n\nAlso just got the shipping notification for my M&F brush. Been a long wait and I don't even think Declaration was launched at that point when I ordered. Contemplating whether it'll stay in my den or not.",

Totally understand what all the fuss is about, and also feel even more lucky that I was able to snag one when I did. Truly stellar soap base and I have to say, North York is a really well-crafted scent. At times I get coffee, at times heaps of vanilla, at times buttery caramel popcorn, at times a stout beer. Really interesting evolving scent.\n\nUnfortunately, I have nothing in my collection at the moment to pair with it. I was thinking of picking up maybe Drunken Goat or Stirling Vanilla Bean Espresso for aftershave pairings, any thoughts from any of you fine folks here?",

High tide at 2:04 this afternoon.\n\nNeeded something to wake me up after being up since 4 and digging out after yesterday's blizzard (15 inches). Decided to shave the head as well. Ooo Boy is Adagio bracing, definitely woke me up. Okay shave today, got rid of a bump on the back of my head that I didn't know was there. Had to go back to the tub after I did the head so I would have enough to do the face, and had to change out the blade halfway through the first face pass. Hoping today goes better than the shave did.\n\nHave a nice Wednesday!",

The additional weight of the SS vs Ti was most welcome when going ATG. I'd say it helped the cutting power, making it just a touch smoother. The polished finish is damn sexy.\n\nShout out to /u/theholyblack for hooking me up with a bottle of Creep outside of the main release. The scent is a fantastic upgrade from the beta batch with the same creeper chill factor. My face loves it.",

Cashmere in a G_Huck stonewood burl beehive handle.*\n***Razor:*** *Schick Injector I2* Hydro-Magic *w/Chinese Schick blade (17).*\n***Post-Shave:*** *Extra lather, cold water splashes, Thayer's* Lavender *Witch Hazel, L'Occitane* L'Occitan *Post-Shave Balm.*\n***Soundtrack:*** Born To Die *by Lana Del Rey.*\n\n\n\n#####*Complex/Woody Blends, Game 2:* First Canadian Shave Soap Co. Hot Summer Lavender *vs.* LA Shaving Soap Co. Woody Lavender\n\nThe final match of our Sweet Sixteen round pits two artisans who are often referred to by goofy acronyms, First Canadian Shave Soap Co. (FCSSCo) and Los Angeles Shaving Soap Co. (LASSCo). I'm going to try to avoid that because I hate acronyms, but I'm also lazy so we'll see how that goes.\n\nToday was my first go with a First Canadian soap, and I was very impressed by its performance. Silk fibres are listed as one of its ingredients, which I don't recall ever having seen before. I don't know what exactly that does for the soap, but it has great residual slickness and post-shave feel, much better than either of the soaps in the previous game. It's easy to lather, and can take a ton of water. It must all be hiding in the silk fibers.\n\nWith notes of lavender, sandalwood, ylang ylang, cedarwood, vetiver, grapefruit, and bergamot it's the most complex blend I have in the competition, and the overall scent of the soap is a nice, woody, slightly smoky lavender. I really enjoyed it even though it's rather a non-traditional lavender scent.\n\nTomorrow, it goes up against La Shaving Soap's *Woody Lavender.* I'm excited to see how it performs, especially after today's impressive showing.\n\n-----\nPrevious | Next\n:-|-:\n[Complex Blends, Game 1: Czech & Speake *Oxford & Cambridge*](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5zb2zf/tuesday_sotd_thread_mar_14_2017/dewvtjx/) | [Complex Blends, Game 2: LA Shaving Soap Co. *Woody Lavender*](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5zpcec/thursday_sotd_thread_mar_16_2017/df0bcrs/)",

First I had a hard time getting a good lather with the C&F, amazing lather with the vegan *Sandalwood & Amber* but this tallow *Fresh Start* for whatever reason was a struggle. I think I may have used too much water or it doesn't like my hard water, I don't know but I went with it anyway and was my first mistake and may have led to the chaos that was about to unfold.\n\nSecond, I got this new vintage straight wedge and I've never used a wedge before, only full hollow grinds. So I had a hard time getting the right angle and it's tough to tell without the audible feedback I'm used to. The side of the blade wanted to stick to my face instead of glide because the wedge is so thick and heavy. And when I would tilt it more so that it didn't stick it would start to dig and once it finally bit me I was done with it. Was it shave ready? I don't know but I stropped it and went for it anyway, mistake number 2 I suppose.\n\nI eventually gave up and switched to the Baby Smooth in frustration and somehow managed to take a chunk out of my left ring finger with it. I don't even know how I managed that with a Baby Smooth but it was a bleeder. So bleeding from the face because of the wedge and from the hand because of the Baby Smooth I decided to quit now for fear of my life and splash on the Lucky Tiger and dig out the Neosporin and bandages.

Decided to go back to the Baby Smooth for the first time in around three weeks on a whim. Still had a blade in it, so that made it easy. I forgot how much bite this razor can have when you screw up the angle, so going to have a bit of irritation on my jawline on the left side, no blood though.\n\nI was weak yesterday. Pre-ordered the Blackberry Blossom Bay Soap/Aftershave combo from CL/L&L after resisting until the last possible day. I also made an order at Maggard to get a bottle of BR Classic and one of their slant heads. Shockingly, the order showed up today! Less than 24 hours from checkout to delivery. Nothing like living 40 min away. Classic feels just as nice as Cool, though I do slightly miss the menthol, but the fragrance is excellent. Some would probably consider it old-man smelling, but I think it's really great.",

This scent from Chatillon Lux is another fantastic offering.\n- u/landlgrooming makes, imho, the finest soap base currently on the market. This soap is stellar.

Decided I'd give my new Maggard Slant a try, and it did not disappoint. Smooth, easy and efficient. No irritation at all after a nice three pass shave. Seemed much more intuitive and comfortable than my Stirling Slant. Thanks /u/Cadinsor for convincing me to give it a try with your last video.\n\nThis is the end of my sample of Ghost Town Barber. I really like how the soap performs, and the scent is great. I have a few more CF samples, so I'll need to try them before deciding which scent(s) to pick up.\n\nHope everybody has a good shave and a good day!",

I tried face lathering which was nice and I feel like my technique is finally starting to develop. I've shortened my strokes, got the angle better, started down my neck further, and am getting better lather. I still had a small amount of blood, but I wasn't patchy like I usually am. It's finally coming along. I'm trying to stay with the same soap and blade to consistently work on my technique.\n\nIm still having a blast playing Destiny and am hoping to be able to run Nightfalls shortly. I reached he city of Junon in Final Fantasy VII and have to do that silly marching mini game.\n\nHave a great day!",

I've been shaving with a DE razor for several months now and have gotten a handle on basic technique, so I decided that I was ready to try Feather Hi-Stainless blades. On top of that, after picking up some techniques and tips from /u/dendj55's tips and tricks video, I decided to leave the bowl in the kitchen and give face lathering a shot.\n\nWhat a great shave! I achieved what is easily the best lather that I've built yet, and combined with the brand new Feather blade, made for one of the smoothest shaves I have ever had. I still have lots of work on the finer points in my technique - my shave didn't come out quite as close as I would like. I'm not sure if I was being cautious with a notoriously sharp blade or there's something else I'm missing, but it was an all around fantastic shave nonetheless!",

I'm thinking not enough water though I did read in yesterday's thread(?) that it doesn't produce the type of lather that say a B&M soap does. On the other hand, Uncle Dubya seems to have generated quite the lather. Thankfully I have an entire tub of it to figure out the lathering. I only hope I figure it out before I run out of soap :/\n\nThe DD post was because I've been wanting to try it for a while but didn't have the soap. Then somebody recommended it for a coffee pairing and I thought I'd give it a shot. And no, I didn't get any coffee scent either. All in all, not the best shave. Gotta take the bad with the good.",

At first it seemed there was not as much boar as I had hoped, but this turned out to be more of an illusion because it's a much more dense knot than the Mistura. Upon face lathering, I got a great amount of scrub, plus the backbone was great, yet it still splayed well. Got a lot of scrub out of it, similar to the Mistura, but a more luxurious face feel due to the density. At the same time, the flow-through was still surprising considering the density.\n\nOverall a great shave despite the fact that this blade is getting tuggy. Wholly Kaw performed outstanding as always, plus this is a great fresh scent without being cloying or sweet. My kind of fresh. Tonight is my girlfriend's birthday, so I'm surprising her with a great night full of surprises. Of course, a great night is built upon the foundation of a great shave and sexy frags...and now I can check that off the list.",

Cashmere in a G_Huck stonewood burl beehive handle.*\n***Razor:*** *Schick Injector I2* Hydro-Magic *w/Chinese Schick blade (18).*\n***Post-Shave:*** *Extra lather, cold water splashes, Thayer's* Lavender *Witch Hazel, L'Occitane* L'Occitan *Post-Shave Balm.*\n***Soundtrack:*** *Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood (the 'Blue Button' one).*\n\n\n\n#####*Complex/Woody Blends, Game 2:* First Canadian Shave Soap Co. Hot Summer Lavender *vs.* LA Shaving Soap Co. Woody Lavender\n\nLA Shaving Soap's *Woody Lavender* marks the last shave in our opening round. It's super easy to lather and a great performer. I would say its slickness is equal to First Canadian's, as is its residual slickness. Its post-shave feel, while good, isn't quite up to par with what I got from the First Canadian soap.\n\nThe scent of this soap is also very interesting. Most of what I get out of it, both in the tub and lathered, is either the Ho Wood or the Amyris note, or maybe a combination of the two. I feel like it's actually more \"woody\" than \"lavender.\" It's a very pleasant scent, which kind of reminds me of cedar, but it's not what I would reach for if I were in the mood for a lavender scent. I'm going to give this one to First Canadian's *Hot Summer Lavender.*\n\nThis has been a lot of fun, so far, and it's given me a chance to try out a lot of soaps that I otherwise would have just ignored. Tomorrow begins our \"division championships,\" which is to say that the winners of the first round in each division go against one another to clinch spots in the Final Four!\n\n-----\nPrevious | Next\n:-|-:\n[Complex Blends, Game 2: First Canadian Shave Soap Co. *Hot Summer Lavender*](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5zi4e9/wednesday_sotd_thread_mar_15_2017/deylqjp/) | [Simple Blends, Division Championship: Hawaiian Shave Co. *Lemi Poni'ala*](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5zwdom/friday_sotd_thread_mar_17_2017/df1w1q5/)",

I must have gotten a good tub because it produced a decent lather. Nothing spectacular but acceptable. Coming off two days of using Saponificio Varesino Stella Alpina, a fantastic soap, it would be really hard to go for this versus many of the better options out there. It was fun to try! :) The Wiz blade is still going strong. I usually change blades every week but may try to push this one further for fun.\nI also decided to try a new frag today, Imaginary Authors \"A City on Fire.\" NOTES: Cade oil, Spikenard, Cardamom, Clearwood, Dark Berries, Labdanum & Burnt Match. It opens with a burnt match scent and is drying down into a dark, smoky finish with other notes now appearing. Should be interesting to see how it develops during the day.\nHave a great day everyone!",

It's a shame B&M discontinued Solarion. It's a complex beauty, as per B&M tradition. Adding in another complex beauty with the Bon Vivant and I may be a bit confused. I have no idea if these two scents match, but I could honestly care less. All I can smell is the toner and it's a sweetie.\n\nSpeaking of complex scents. I know there's at least one cranky old fart around here who believes large soap/cream collections disallows the enjoyment of particular scent offerings. I disagree with this notion. I rotate between many soaps and I am continually surprised at how I pick up different aspects of many soaps each time I use them. 100 soaps/creams may be on the severe side, but 40? 60? The artisans, with complex scents are absolutely killing it.\n\nEnjoy the day and the shaves......\n",

Interesting... Smooth shave this morning. First time using Jurate and I'm digging the scent & performance on this soap. As for the razor & blade, always a winning combination. Purchased the Omega 40033 after a recommendation from /u/airbornesimian and his followers of the cult. For $7, it punches WAY above its price point. Currently, I still love the boar knot on my zenith boar but once this bad boy is broken in more, I could see this brush fitting for the top spot (boar knot wise).",

When you tell a person what their problem is and they say \"I know\" and restate the problem, and then you tell them how to fix it, it's frustrating when they say \"well can you help me?\"\n\nMotherfucker, I just told you what your problem is and how to solve it.",

Probably still have at least 7 or 8 shaves with Black Ice, if not like 15. I decided to spice things up a bit today by adding a few drops of my Snakebite aftershave to the lather. At first it hissed and bubbled, so I was afraid I'd created a dangerous chemical reaction that I was planning to brush onto my face. Turned out fine and gave it a bit of extra chill.\n\nAnother nice shave with the slant. No stinging or burning from the aftershave at all. Have a good Friday, everybody :)",

I was very disappointed because I really liked it the few times I used it. I have a ton of it too. I guess I have to sell/trade it since I can't use it. Also if anyone was setting up a PIF that could use some additional soap/samples, I would be interested in donating some or all of it. About 7 oz total.",

Saw that /u/enormoshob had paired it with The Kraken, and it pairs very nicely with it. I added a ton of water to it, and it gobbled it all up with no issues. To me, the post shave is awesome, as is slickness and cushion. Sounds like he is reformulating, and I sort of can't wait to see how it improves.",

Another day to go full rose. The Coate's held up well to two days of growth. Still plenty slick and protective. The scent on this one was roughly the same strength as the lavender. Still on the milder side, but plenty noticable. Unlike some rose scents that can be sharper and some that almost have a woody character, this one is very soft and floral. It flowed well into the other choices I made for the day, and I'll take any chance I get to go with the Lyric Man.

The brush was not bad at all out of the box. I would compare it much more toward badger than boar. Pretty damn soft. Thanks to the banter on horse hair brushes, I took the plunge and I'm glad I did. Didn't hurt that I received an email from Bullgoose for 30% off all Vie-Ling items! Shave itself was terrific (how can it not be when L&L is involved?) I like *After the Rain*, but I wish my nose could pick up more the wet pine and cedar. It is a really nice smelling soap, don't get me wrong. Great St. Patrick's Day/Friday shaves to all.",

Lemi Poni'ala *vs.* Reef Point Soaps Tranquility\n\nDivision championships! I think, for this round, I'm going to use the same brush all the way through, but switch razors between each game, just for kicks.\n\nOK first up is our Simple Blends division, and the first soap in this match is Hawaiian Shave Co's *Lemi Poni'ala.* This is a seriously good performing soap. I noticed that it felt a bit thirstier this morning than I remembered from last time, so I added a lot more water and found that not only can the soap take it, it improved its already good performance dramatically. The residual slickness and post-shave feel really stood out this morning. Color me impressed.\n\nThe scent is maybe a li'l lighter than I prefer, but it's definitely a nice, even blend of lavender and citrus, and quite enjoyable for that. Even as in *steady* rather than *equal;* the citrus note is a bit muted, but it brings a nice gentle brightness to the lavender note.\n\nIt's up against some stiff competition in last year's winner, but I'm not anywhere close to writing it off. This newcomer is a serious contender.\n\nPerformances this good from the first soap in a match make me doubly excited for the 2nd. I hope I'm not too bleary-eyed and palsied to really appreciate tomorrow's shave with *Tranquility.*\n\nErin go Bragh, everyone!

When I first started shaving, I bought a DE89 and a Standard Razor. I tried the Standard a couple times, but I got terrible shaves from it. It turned out on one side the guard bar was bent quite a bit. The people at Standard sent me a new one (although they made me pay for shipping), but by the time it arrived I had already picked up a Fatboy, a New LC, and a Gillette Rocket, so the Standard was pushed to the back of the shelf. Tonight I decided to give it another try after watching it collect dust for so long.\n\nIt was terrible, again. I actually checked to make sure I didn't use the bent plate by accident. I thought maybe way back there was a mix of the bad plate and inexperience, but now I can generally get a good shave with most razors. I have used a V3A, a Fatboy on 9, and a Rockwell with the R6 setting with great results. The Standard has defeated me so far though.\n\nThe Fine Platinum seems like it could have been awesome under other circumstances, so I'm excited to give it another shot once my face heals up a bit. The Standard, I'm sure I'll give it another go, but the leash is short before it gets PIF'd.",

It smells amazing.\n\nVoskhod blade felt really good in the Wolfman, this razor is starting to become my daily driver, a RAD killer for sure! Haha.\n\nThird day using the Vie-Long. I got some minor brush burn on my face. It is still a not prickly. But my one complaint? No one told me that horse hair brushes smelled like ass.\n\nHave a great Friday guys!",

Upon first sniff it comes of as very heavy anise/licorice smell from the fennel, but upon lathering, it quickly mellows out to a very pleasant woodsy slightly anise scented soap. Its really nice and is certainly a keeper. Great all around shave today and I just continue to be enthralled at the perfection that is Reserve Cool. That shit is straight-up heaven in a bottle and I can hardly wait for the soap to drop.\n\nHappy Saturday gents! :)",

The knot is scrubbier than I expected, but is definitely nice. I was expecting some lather hogging due to density and since it is so new, but it really didn't at all.. Indicates great things to come once it breaks in. Really impressed and glad I got this setup.\n\nThe OC Blackbird feels familiar if you have experience with the SB version. However, it is more efficient and feels a bit more aggressive. I was practically BBS after a WTG and XTG, which is unheard of with any other razor I have used. No irritation, but it has that slight feel of being almost too aggressive - we'll see if it is an every day kind of razor, but it is definitely nice.",

It's way cleaner and golder than the picture shows.\n\nThis is a bitey aggressive little bastard, maybe a bit more than the Gillette Old Type thin cap on which it was based. Still a nice shaver. The thin dainty handle will take some getting used to though. It might be sacrilege to use a thick cap on it, but I probably will at some point.",

Decided to bust out the boar brush that I haven't used in a long ass time. Continuing to work my way through this Black Ice. It matches at least decently with this splash from CL, because to me Black Ice comes off as more herbal/earthy anise than candy-ish black licorice. I continue to be impressed by my shaves with the Maggard Slant.\n\nI noticed that Stirling released some new scents in the past couple days, so I went and picked up MORE samples. I got Glastonbury, Port Au Prince, Pearberry, Plumeria, Sunflower Fields (I know it says it's a women's scent, but it sounded interesting, shut up), and then a couple of older ones I haven't tried but sound nice - Gin & Tonic, Margaritas in the Arctic, Sharp Dressed Man, and Mountain Man. I did the math a bit, and once these new samples show up, I will have the equivalent of about 5 full Stirling tubs just in samples. Variety is fun!\n\nHope everybody has a good day and good shave.",

Lemi Poni'ala *vs.* Reef Point Soaps Tranquility\n\nMan, I'm really starting to love this soap. *Tranquility's* scent is so lovely and invigorating it seems to be getting even more enjoyable on subsequent uses. The peppermint note lends exactly the right energy to the lavender to make for an excellent morning shave.\n\nThough I don't use it often enough, Reef Point always seems to be like visiting an old friend when I do. It's among the best performers in my den. It has great residual slickness and post-shave feel.\n\nHappily, *Lemi Poni'ala* was able to hang in with it, performance-wise. Hawaiian Shave Co. really did a great job on that soap, and I highly recommend it to anyone who's looking for a good lavender/citrus scent.\n\nThat said, just like *Tranquility's* last, this match has come down to scent preference, and again I find that I prefer its scent to that of its competitor. I guess I just like lavender/peppermint more than lavender/citrus.\n\nReef Point's *Tranquility* is the champion of the Simple Blends division, and it moves on to the Final Four, where it will compete against the champion of the Creams division. That champion will be decided on Monday.\n\nHappy Saturday, all! Tomorrow: Speick!\n\n-----\nPrevious | Next\n:-|-:\n[Simple Blends, Division Championship: Hawaiian Shave Co. *Lemi Poni'ala*](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5zwdom/friday_sotd_thread_mar_17_2017/df1w1q5/) | [Creams, Division Championship: Speick](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/60941h/sunday_sotd_thread_mar_19_2017/df4snxh/)",

The brush is smaller than I was expecting but also better looking; I think Brad has better Jade stock than Paladin or something because there isn't an excessive amount of brown in it.\nThe soap sample was supposed to be evaluated for performance but the scent was also nice. Light and minty. Performance was also very good - easy to whip up a beautiful lather and it seemed to take water pretty well (though I didn't try to break it) and it left my face pretty moisturized post shave. It definitely is above the threshold for quality soaps, so it's hard for me to differentiate its sickness and stuff from others since I can get good shaves from all the other good artisans.",

This is only my third use of it, and I love it more every time I use it! For as dense and large as it is, it's easier to rinse than I imagined it would be too. Hell yeah!!!\n\nWhen I first got this S2 a few years ago, I used it about 4 times and put it away for about 6 months...when I got back to it I enjoyed using it much more, technique had improved, I found blades that worked better for me, and I realized blades just don't last as long in the S2 as in other razors for whatever reason. Moving forward, after finding my wonder blade, and realizing just how many shaves I can really pull out of a blade, I think I need to reassess longevity in the S2. That said, I'm going to keep rocking the S2 rig until the blade starts to suck.\n\nHope everyone is having a great weekend!",

It's a decently warm day and I was going to be working outside for a little bit, so for some reason Trismegistus stood out to me.\n\nThe goatee also got mowed down today. I couldn't take it any more. Probably should have used a fresh blade with that much growth, but the Voskhod that already had 6 shaves on it did well enough. A little tugging in the heavy-growth areas.",

I'm in Florence right now and found out my hotel is just a stone's throw from Officina Profumo-Farmaceutica di Santa Maria Novella. This is the oldest pharmacy in Europe, founded by Dominican Friars in 1612. They make their products using traditional methods, with plethora of fragrances with beautiful presentations. [The shop itself is beautiful](https://imgur.com/a/V7pj7) all marble, with soaring ceilings, ancient windows, and displays of antique pharmaceutical objects.\n\nI could have spent a lot of money here, let's put it that way. But I decided to limit myself to their crema da barba and one aftershave.\n\nThe best way to describe their shaving cream is to say, imagine if Proraso Green was very, very, very good. Similar scent, but better, with a subtle hint of tobacco. The performance was incredible. The lather exploded off of my brush and left my face feeling soft and wonderful.\n\nThe aftershave was my favorite part, though. Scents are where this place really shines, and this tobacco scent feels classic and masculine without being too overbearing. The aftershave felt wonderful on my face as well, leaving me with a slight scent of tobacco and a great face feel.\n\nIf you're ever in Florence, check this place out! It really is an experience not to be missed.",

It's excellent. The performance is good ol reliable B&M but the scent is more robust than usual. Lavanille was robust but this one is different, there is so much going on and true to it's name, it really is grand. I'm glad LGC is going to be permanent in the line up. I will wait for this soap's release.\n\n\nTo top it off, Floid Blue just on the neck. I miss it's mild, cooling barbershop scent.\n\n\nI'm still recovering from a horrid gout attack but I feel like a million bucks. Enjoy your weekend, mates.",

Odd as this sounds, I'm glad I did. This soap is more difficult to lather when it's dried out. I bloomed it while I showered. The only soap I bloom. Even with a 5 minute soak, the puck was still not hydrated enough. I worked it until there was a big mound of fluffy lather in the mug. I dumped that out and continued working the puck. A smaller mound of fluffy lather formed. I dumped that off too. Now the puck was adequately hydrated and I was able to work up some nice creamy lather suitable for shaving with. It's hard to believe that this was my only soap before I discovered shaving forums. But since I used it every day, the puck stayed well hydrated. After a really nice shave I discovered the ring of death in my puck. It's been a while since I've seen one of those. Enjoy your Sunday.",

The shave I paired the head up with the handle of my standard razor and man is that actually really nice! The shave might be the best/easiest of any new razor I have tried yet. The Mickey Lee is spot on a very nice scent.\n\n**SOTD**\n•**Prep:** Warm water splashes and coffee\n•**Soap:** Mickey Lee Paradise Frost\n•**Brush:** Stirling Kong\n•**Razor:** The General\n•**Blade:** Feather Pro(2)\n•**Post:** B&M Rhapsody\n\nSo same razor and blade setup as my first shave to make sure it's not a fluke. The razor is an outstanding performer for me, makes for an easy shave. This morning when I took the bully puppy out I noticed it was warming up so the menthol in this soap wasn't a deal breaker. This soap is my thing grapefruit and menthol can't beat that! Enjoy your shaves everyone I know I certainly have been!",

It's been a nice side tour, and they perform very well, but I'm glad to be returning to modern artisan soaps. While fragrance is the backbone of scent longevity, and soap scent isn't something that really stays with you, it's still very nice to have those rich smells during the shave, and their soft radiance for a few moments after. The Coate's, if from age or formulation or some combination of both, lack the ability to really deliver that. They will be taking over an important role for me though. They are perfect little tubes for a travel cream. The scent on the Tea Tree was somewhere in the middle of the Coate's pack. Not as strong as a couple of the better ones, but not non-existant like some. It's a straight sharp camphorous/medicinal tea tree scent. For me it wanted a sharp fougère, and the Aramis Tuscany is a nice woody aromatic, with some herbal and medicinal tones, so it layered on nicely. This was one I didn't appreciate at first, but have come to really respect. If you like Azzaro Pour Homme, this one will also suit you.\n\n\n\nHave a good one!\n\n\n\n**Soaps**\n\n[<< Coate's Shaving Cream - Superior Sandalwood](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/6033rc/saturday_sotd_thread_mar_18_2017/df3d2e5/)\n\n[L & L Grooming - Harmony >>](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/60fanu/monday_sotd_thread_mar_20_2017/df61hjy/)\n****\n\n**Tours**\n\n[Razor Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5lefc9/happy_new_year_sotd_thread_jan_01_2017/dbv6f4p/)\n\n[Brush Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5o322q/sunday_sotd_thread_jan_15_2017/dcgf5ud/)\n\n[Soap Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5q99m5/thursday_sotd_thread_jan_26_2017/dcxird1/)\n",

I can see the bottom of the tin with my Black Ice sample, so that's good news.\n\nLa Quatrieme Ville is very nice. The main note that my nose picks up on is vetiver, but it's a very nice woody scent to me. Yesterday I was getting slight whiffs of it something like 6 hours after putting it on.",

I'm so impressed by how this cream performs, I'm actually having trouble finding words for it. Its performance, today, was exactly like the previous round: Phenomenal. Slick AF. Thick & protective without clogging the razor. Residual slickness and post-shave feel for days.\n\nThe bouquet has just the right amount of citrus to give it a bit of brightness before that peppery note from the speick extract comes in and dials the whole thing up to 11. It's delicious.\n\nI don't know how/why it works this way, but the scent of the cream seems to have much more nuance than the soap stick. The cream also outperforms the soap. I think the soap stick is likely a better overall value because it tends to be less expensive an will probably last longer than the tube of cream, but then the cream is by no means a bad value in its own right. /u/old_hiker, if you're still looking for a suitable replacement for **CADE** Rich cream, don't overlook Speick. Even though its price is much lower than the \"luxury\" creams, it goes to bat with all of them from what I've seen so far.\n\nSt. James of London is slated for tomorrow, and I'm excited to see how it performs. My first impression of it was quite favorable, though I found it to be a bit product-hungry. I'll have to keep that in mind for tomorrow's shave.\n\nEnjoy your Sunday, all.\n\n-----\nPrevious | Next\n:-|-:\n[Simple Blends, Division Championship: Reef Point Soaps *Tranquility*](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/6033rc/saturday_sotd_thread_mar_18_2017/df3huev/) | [Creams, Championship: St. James of London *Lavender & Geranium*](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/60fanu/monday_sotd_thread_mar_20_2017/df68rdu/)",

Gotta get it into my head that I won't feel the blade at all and hair will disappear like magic.\n\nBlackberry Blossom Bay continues to be a top contender for my favorite post scent. It's lovely, I catch whiffs over 12 hours after application (some rubbed off my face onto my jacket once and I'd catch whiffs past 24 hours), receive a lot of compliments on it and it's amazing for the skin.

I went shimless as I just keep getting good shaves from this blade.\n\nThis razor felt absolutely foreign at first. I haven't shaved with anything other than my '47 Aristocrat since I got it (which was 27 shaves ago) and this thing is the exact opposite of the Aristocrat. It's super light and aggressive, I imagine this is what you guys mean when you say the razor feels like an extension of your hand.\n\nOverall it was a good shave. It was very easy to find and keep the proper angle on account of the blade exposure and I'm looking forward to trying it out with and shim and a fresh blade.",

AlumiWolf is still too light but it does shave nice.\n\n[Dirty English](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Juicy-Couture/Dirty-English-for-Men-2701.html) is a bit disappointing. Smells really nice. Dry woods scent but it doesn't last very long. I guess they reformulated it. Oh well. Montana Graphite is the much better choice in this scent family and price range.\n\n",

To my mind it's a soft soap, I probably could have been more liberal.\n\n\nNext time I'll make sure to load more than enough. With that said, the performance was good, I'm just missing a little more residual slickness towards the end, but other than that, the shave was smooth sailing.\n\n\nI'll use my HB more to dial it in.",

As advertised, it's a heavy incense scent. While not something I care for all the time, I can easily be in the mood for it, especially on the weekends. I find it to be a very relaxing scent. Not a bad way to start the week out either. At first I was going to pair this with Bon Vivant, and its smoldering smoky essence. I think that would be a fantastic pairing, however I happened to glance at the Sunshine man, and its spicy bubblegum and sunshine vibe seemed to call out to go with the Harmony.

On the one hand, I'm smelling old-school lecherous. On the other hand, I'm warm, spicy, and of the open sea.\n\nIt's a bare knuckles brawl between early 80s Christopher Cross (think \"Sailing\") and mid-70s Conway Twitty (\"I See the Want to in Your Eyes\"). It's a fair fight, but don't ever bet against Clubman. Like Conway, Clubman will overpower you with its boldness and strength and greasy allure. But keep your senses about you, and your head on a swivel, because ol' dude's got a shiv in his boot for if things get dicey, and also a 3-pack of ribbed and lubed rubbers in the glove box of the El Camino for when he's chosen tonight's lover, and it's time to lay a towel down.\n\nI love Christopher Cross, don't get me wrong. But he isn't going home with your girl. Well, maybe he would, but the morning after when she sees that crumpled Warren Moon 3XL replica jersey on the floor, she'll be running back to you. Not so with Conway. Conway keeps what he takes.",

I also like Thayers (I picked it up from a friend's shelf), but for myself I'd probably get the aftershave instead - I feel like without the slight burn of the alcohol, I was a little itchy later.",

I didn't notice that the last time I shaved with it. It actually made the whole thing feel a bit more complete, which was nice.\n\nLast time, I felt like my lather needed more product, so today I used more. Good choice. The performance of the cream increased twofold. The residual slickness and post-shave feel, which I felt were lacking last time, came out in full force this time. It's really a fantastic cream, whose performance is probably about equal to Speick's.\n\nIn a way, I'm glad I had that reaction to the Simpson cream in the first round, because it allowed me a 2nd chance with the St. James, and I was able to dial it in much better on that subsequent use, which also happened with Hawaiian Shaving Co's *Lemi Poni'ala* in the 2nd round. It makes me think that perhaps that initial round should be double-elimination or something. I'll have to consider that for next year.\n\nAt any rate, St. James really stepped up to the plate, today, and performed excellently against Speick, which is awesome; it's exactly what I wanted to see in this tournament. Two tough contenders giving it their all (provided that I can figure out how to dial in lathers easily). I think Speick maybe has a slightly better post-shave? But honestly I don't know if I could tell the difference. This one's probably going to come down to scent preference, in which case I'm giving it to Speick. *Lavender & Geranium* is an excellent scent, and I could definitely see myself owning a tub of it. However, I think I definitely like the peppery note and the light citrus in Speick a bit more.\n\nAnother upset. Tomorrow, Big 4 Division championship begins with the triumphant return of Mickey Lee!\n\n-----\nPrevious | Next\n:-|-:\n[Creams, Division Championship: Speick](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/60941h/sunday_sotd_thread_mar_19_2017/df4snxh/) | [Big 4, Division Championship: Mickey Lee Soapworks *Jefferson Square*](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/60md4n/tuesday_sotd_thread_mar_21_2017/df7t7hm/)",

They don't seem to get a whole lot of love around here, so I wasn't sure what to expect. Thus I was surprised with a very nice shave. It took a bit of time to lather, but the slickness was good and it boasted a nice post-shave skinfeel as well. I'm not in love with the Bay Rum scent - it's very clean and bay forward, but not as interesting as the Stirling Bay Rum I last used. If I ever whittle down the crazy number of samples i have, I might try out some other Captain's Choice soaps to see how those scents stack up.\n\nStill a huge fan of the Maggard Slant. It's so smooth. Hope everybody has a good day and good shave!",

The entire blend works together as more notes unfold to become a sweet smokey and musky smell. I prefer the musk note to night musics musk by quite a bit, it's a more refined musk, and, not quite the smell of the wild.\n\n10/10 will shave again.\n\nMy face is still tingly from the snake bite.",

Nice scent but not sure it's for me. I'm going to try and use it a couple more times this week.\n\n[Bvlgari Black](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Bvlgari/Black-154.html) Figured this would compliment the soap very well with its vanilla, leather, rubber smell. It's great stuff. Totally unique and very affordable. Be nice if it had some more strength and longevity but if you spray it on your shirt it will last long enough.\n\n",

Performance was pretty decent. Adequate slickness and post shave feel. The scent was pleasant but light - sort of a colonia scent toned down by a number of magnitudes. I was a bit disappointed by the menthol content - I was pretty convinced it didn't actually have any until I felt the slightest cooling sensation while rinsing off after my first pass.\n\nI hit up /u/landlgrooming this morning and picked up a tub of Bandwagon and TSM Fougere. I already have a tub of Marshlands on the way from the Groomatorium, but slightly bummed that I paid $18 for it there only to find out L&L has it on sale for $13. It was so hard to decide which scent to pick up aside from Bandwagon (had to get that free shipping, yo) - almost went with Trismegistus, but decided on TSM Fougere at the last minute.\n\nHope everybody has a good shave and good day.",

So regarding Rhino, when I first opened the tub yesterday morning, I was pleased with the scent and scent strength (8 to 9). After a few more sniffs, I started to feel like the scent might not be for me. Decided to put some in a bowl since I didn't want to lather in such a beautiful piece of art. Once, I lathered up the soap, the scent strength dropped quite a bit and more pleasing to my nose. I feel like this scent is going to grow on me. Performance was top notch as always with CF soaps.\n\n\n\nHaven't used my Gillette slim for quite some time, so I decided I would use this whole week. Not really sure why I haven't. Always gives me great shaves.\n\n\n\n\n**Have a great shave everyone!**",

The only issue I had was I felt a *slight* tingle after my first pass was complete. Subsequent passes didn't get any worse, thank goodness. I am certainly happy I put this in my cart with my *Rhino* order. I think there will be a ton of CFG/Zoologist *Rhinoceros* shaves today. I couldn't decide what to pair with it, so I deferred to *Sherlock* LOL\nGreat Tuesday shaves to all.",

Just a really great soap. Started off with the General, but I had forgotten to change the blade out, so I subbed in the SC. This had been in my dopp kit for a while, but after using it the other day in a hotel, I realized I had been criminally neglecting such a great razor. Cue that shitty Santana/Rob Thomas song, because that shit was smooth.",

An anecdote:\n\nThis morning, my son woke up early, while I was lathering for my shave. I finished building my lather, and then took a 5 minute break to put him down in front of *Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood* and hunt down an episode that he would accept, so that I could finish my shave. Then I got back to my bathroom and did my first pass to no degradation whatsoever in the performance of that lather. Then, after my first pass, he came into the bathroom and told me he was hungry, so I took another 5 to peel and section an orange for him to eat. Then I got back to my bathroom and was able to finish my shave. The soap didn't miss a beat the entire time. It soldiered on, zero fucks given. End result: 100% smooth, no irritation, nicks or weepers. That's a good performing soap.\n\nThe scent is just fantastic. It's 24/7 lavender in one of the more elegant blends I've seen. I tend to prefer lavender when it's mixed with other scent notes, but *Jefferson Square's* blend is just outta this world.\n\nToday was yet another excellent performance by a top notch soap. I'm totally looking forward to Dapper Dragon bringing its 'A' game tomorrow. I have a feeling this is going to be one of the tougher matches to call in this tournament, since these artisans are two of my all-time faves, and I've really enjoyed both of these scents in different ways. Should be exciting!\n\nHappy Tuesday, everyone!\n\n-----\nPrevious | Next\n:-|-:\n[Creams, Championship: St. James of London *Lavender & Geranium*](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/60fanu/monday_sotd_thread_mar_20_2017/df68rdu/) | [Big 4, Division Championship: Dapper Dragon *Lavender Lizard*](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/60tcvm/wednesday_sotd_thread_mar_22_2017/df983lb/)",

This beauty is extremely smooth while not sacrificing any efficiency. Two passes with some slight buffering in my trouble spots (mustache, Adams apple, and jawline) got me a BBS finish without any irritation. I'm very happy with this acquisition. I would recommend trying one if you're in the market for a high end razor.\n\nRhino is Rum boozey off the puck but it bloomed into something dark that that kind of reminded me of Stag. I'm glad they released this as I doubt I would have explored this scent as on my own.",

      "body": "Rhino test shave last night\n\n* **Prep:** Warm splash of water\n* **Soap:** Chiseled Face Groomatorium - Rhinoceros\n* **Brush:** Maggard Razors - 22mm Synthetic\n* **Razor:** Standard Razor\n* **Blade:** Gillette - Silver Blue (2)\n* **Post:** Cold Water & Alum Block\n* **Aftershave:** Shave Ship - Armada Blossom\n\nLike many, I received my tub of Chiseled Face Groomatorium - Rhinoceros yesterday. I excitedly opened it up and took a huge whiff with my nose directly in the tub. Big Mistake. This scent is strong, and that's the #1 way to get turned off by any scent.\n\nThe scent hit me hard, and I had to pull away face. Honestly, I did not like it. I could get a \"cologne\" impression, but there was a biting sharp scent up front. My assumption is that is the \"rum\" topnote.\n\nI took some more whiffs from a distance, and tried to keep an open mind. When my wife came home, I handed it to her without giving her any of my initial impressions, and she had an average-to-decently-good take on it.\n\nThat's better than some of the stuff I've brought to her attention, so I figured I'd give it a shot.\n\nAnother redditor gave a review that the power of the scent is cut tremendously during the lather, and I'd agree. That's not to say it goes away though. The scent strength on this soap is one of the the stronger ones of any soap I've tried. I have a large master bathroom, and my wife said she could smell it from the door across the room. But in saying that, it's nice that my nose isn't being overpowered by the scent during the shave.\n\nThe lather was up to the quality of my previous experiences with Chiseled Face, which is on par with the other top artisan soap makers. Honestly, I was shaving about half a day before my normal every-other-day routine, and I was worried about my skin's chances of surviving unscathed. Well, I don't know if it was the soap, or me being extra careful with this Standard Razor I received as a gift and have been enjoying, but overall, it was a really good shave with only one nick on a spot that has been giving me trouble lately (Probably just re-cut the same nick from last time.)\n\nI finished off with Shave Ship - Armada Blossom since it's the only thing I have that could even remotely pair (and I like it a lot already), and I think the pairing was fine.\n\nMy impression of the Rhinoceros is still up in the air. Like I said, the shave was good, but I'm not sold on the scent just yet. I'll give it one or two more shaves, but I may have to put this one up on the bazaar in the end. There are too many good products out there with a bunch that I already love to have one sit unused because I'm so-so on it. Someone else can love it.",

I can remember liking the Super Platinums but they're a little pricier. Still need to give the Stainless a try. The third shave on this blade was excellent; not one bit of irritation. Recently picked up this Tech as a backup for my other gold one. The finish isn't the nicest but I love how these razors shave.

I haven't worn this in quite some time, but I'm glad I decided to pair it with YRP. It's like sunshine in a bottle to me, big and bright, and [edit: Lemony and] herbal. It is definitely one for the warmer months, so there is reason it's been a while since I've rocked it. I think I remember reading it compared to Chanel Egoiste Platinum, but aside from the aromatic aspect, I don't really make the connection, and I don't like CEP, so there's that.

Chimera/Supply Provision Custom 3 dot head\nBlade: Chick\nBrush: That Darn Rob silvertip\nSoap: B&M Hallows\nPost Care: Thayers Witch Hazel\nAlum\nAftershave: B&M Hallows\n\nAnother couple of firsts tonight; first try of the Hallows and Chimera. First, the Hallows, something drew me towards using this soap tonight, maybe it was a sense of dread. I don't care what it was, I love this scent. Very dark, I got a lot of chocolate of the soap and a little dark Vetiver. The aftershave is slightly different, I'm getting a predominately wet forest scent with some more Vetiver thrown in. Awesome!\n\nSpeaking of awesome, the Chimera was a pleasure to use, awkward, but still a pleasure. Since I can count on one hand my number of straight shaves I stuck with only using it for the sides of my face and neck. It's loud, balanced and easy to maneuver. I only did WTG passes but I did 3 then cleaned up everything with the Supply. Not BBS but close and zero blood or irritation. Excellent shave tonight. Have a great day folks!",

Had to use it when it came in the mail. Really smooth shaver. It was a rainy day today, so I wanted to go with a warm , earthy scent, Arkadia fit the bill nicely.\n\nFirst time using a badger, thanks to /u/Vigilantesd for recommending the Elite Manchurian, he also convinced to buy the Starscape handle. The Elite Manchurian is a pleasure to use, super soft, as soft as my synthetics! It bloomed really nicely, and I look forward to using it again.\n\nStarscape handle, is just stunning to look at in person. Happy I bought it. It's such a unique look and design.\n\nI hope you all have a great Wednesday.",

This soap just does not quit. I would put its performance at least on par with its competitor in this round. Maybe, ***maybe*** *Lavender Lizard* came away with a slightly better post-shave feel than *Jefferson Square,* but I'm not really sure if that's just an effect of the fact that I'm still feeling my face now and can't remember exactly how it felt yesterday.\n\nThis one definitely comes down to scent, and jeez, this is a tough one to call. *Lavender Lizard* has that amazing powdery thing going on at the back end, and it's actually pulling a *Ghost Town Barber* right now and lending itself to *Champs de Lavande* in a manner that's simply exquisite. On the other hand, *Jefferson Square* is a blend of different lavenders that ends up being simply intoxicating in a way that I can't quite explain. They're both amazing in completely different ways.\n\nOK, since I can't shave half of my face with each of the two soaps in the next round, it's time to call this one. I'm tipping it toward *Jefferson Square,* because that *je ne sais quoi* in its bouquet has me captivated. It's the division champion of the Big 4, and will face off against the winner of the next match.\n\n-----\nPrevious | Next\n:-|-:\n[Big 4, Division Championship: Mickey Lee Soapworks *Jefferson Square*](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/60md4n/tuesday_sotd_thread_mar_21_2017/df7t7hm/) | [Complex Blends, Division Championship: Czech & Speake *Oxford & Cambridge*](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/610l9q/thursday_sotd_thread_mar_23_2017/dfawms7/)",

Only switched up the aftershave to keep things a little interesting. My face was screaming during the shave and I'm going to blame the blade. It's only the 3rd shave on that blade so I'm disappointed it won't last any longer.",

Now I know first hand why Valobra is so well regarded. It was super easy to load up plenty of soap, and it created that perfectly slick fluid lather. Is better than the best artisan offerings out there? Hard to say after just one shave, but I would say it's on par with the best ones, not really out in front. It's a subtley different experience, neither better nor worse, but very, very good. The scent is phenomenal. As soon as I started lathering the scent bloomed tremendously. A quick peppery blast, almost a black pepper scent with that subtle citrus edge that black pepper can have. That, doesn't last long as it is almost immediately pulled under by this wave of billowy, creamy sandalwood. It's a beautiful smooth sandalwood, and the best sandalwood soap I have ever smelled. It smelled good on the puck, but once lathered, it just exploded in intensity. It provided an excellent platform for the Lutens, which is also sandalwood heavy. It's going to be a good day for smells.\n\n\n\nHave a good one!\n\n\n\n**Soaps**\n\n[<< L & L Grooming - Unconditional Surrender](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/60md4n/tuesday_sotd_thread_mar_21_2017/df7mgyk/)\n\n[The Holy Black - Lavender Creeper >>](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/610l9q/thursday_sotd_thread_mar_23_2017/dfaxahj/)\n****\n\n**Tours**\n\n[Razor Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5lefc9/happy_new_year_sotd_thread_jan_01_2017/dbv6f4p/)\n\n[Brush Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5o322q/sunday_sotd_thread_jan_15_2017/dcgf5ud/)\n\n[Soap Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5q99m5/thursday_sotd_thread_jan_26_2017/dcxird1/)\n",

Also have samples of Seville and Cheshire so I can get an idea for how their other bases perform. Scent is nice - I get mostly currant at first whiff, but I can also smell some kinda creamy sweet depth from the Sandalwood and Amber. Super easy to load and lather, and the slickness was pretty great.\n\nI think Santal Absolut pairs very well with this soap - they are both sandalwood, but more interesting than straight sandalwood.\n\nThis blade was a little bit tuggy on the first pass today, but performed like a champ otherwise and didn't seem to leave any irritation in its wake.\n\nHope everybody has a good shave and good day!",

Cutting out of work early to see Pierre Bensusan at Eddie's Attic tonight. Can't wait. Additionally, the Stirling Finest is my first foray into badger knots. I gotta say, after using it for a solid three months, I vastly prefer boar knots. Can anyone comment on whether this brush is decent enough to form an opinion regarding all badger knots? Or is this one truly a \"budget\" feeling knot, and therefore it might still be worth trying something a little more premium?\n\nHappy Thursday gents (and ladies).",

If my lather were not so good, I don't think I'd be into that, but after 5 consecutive shaves with this base, I'm really impressed with the performance. The Jr will make an awesome travel/loaner razor.\n\nDiffering opinions welcome😀",

Hot Summer Lavender\n\nCzech & Speak, with its Valobra-made soap base, is a damn good performer. I noted last time that it was ridiculously slick even though I think my lather needed more water, and so I made a point to add more water this time. It got even slicker, and I still think it could have used more water. After all this is over, I'm going to need to take a week or so and really dial this stuff in.\n\nThat said, its performance was excellent in every respect even without a properly dialed-in lather. It has a nice, wide range of hydration at which it will perform, which is a great thing for a soap to have.\n\nI got a bit more out of its scent this time, as well, but not much. The lavender and citrus notes are definitely still there, but the mint came out a bit as well, both in scent and face feel. I also *think* I was able to detect a hint of an herbal note which must have been the rosemary, but it was sort of muted by the oakmoss. I wasn't really sold on the scent initially; it was pleasant enough, but last time I felt that performance is where this soap lives. I still think that, but the scent is starting to grow on me, now.\n\nTomorrow, we finish up the division championships with First Canadian's *Hot Summer Lavender,* which really impressed me last time. I'm excited to see how it holds up against Czech & Speake.\n\n-----\nPrevious | Next\n:-|-:\n[Big 4, Division Championship: Dapper Dragon *Lavender Lizard*](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/60tcvm/wednesday_sotd_thread_mar_22_2017/df983lb/) | [Complex Blends, Division Championship: First Canadian *Hot Summer Lavender*](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/617p0d/friday_sotd_thread_mar_24_2017/dfcobk0/)",

Off the puck, it's very rum heavy. I think the other notes seemed to come out more the more I lathered it. Having used the frag before probably also helps identify the other notes in the soap. I'll probably only use this one rarely for special occasions, as I'll pair it with the frag, and that ain't cheap. But it's damn good stuff. And god damn is the packaging spectacular.",

As someone who's skin can't tolerate menthol, but desperately wants the post shave cool down, this was something of a unique niche in the marketplace that no one else has stepped into. I'd been watching for this ever since the menthol-x test run from last fall. It seemed to get good feedback, so even though it was on the pricier side, I went ahead and ordered a set. Very nice packaging on this one. Ceramic tub, well labeled, and a large 8 oz. volume of aftershave splash in a unique presentation. The scent on the soap is very nice. Well rounded lavender, with hints of eucalyptus and black pepper. As someone who loves lavender, this one suits me quite well, though there is nothing about it that screams unique, aside from the fact that it doesn't smell mentholated. The great news for me is, that I got absolutely no irritation from it. Unlike menthol, which burns my face up, and leaves it red and puffy, this stuff just went on cool, and kept getting colder. Re-applying lather between passes was like rubbing an ice cube across my face. It was fantastic. This is the soap I want for our brutally hot summer days. The soap performed very well. It was thirsty, and I think I stopped just short of the perfect ratio, but it was still slick and protective, and the post shave was good. My biggest complaint is that the usability of the product was compromised for the presentation aspects of the packaging. The ceramic tubs are very nice, but also about the size of a Latha tub, so not the easiest for loading a larger brush. Also, the splash bottle has just a large corked opening with no restrictor. That means either using a pipette, carefully free pouring or decanting into another dispenser. None of those are great options. It's not unusable, but in general, I've never been a fan of form over function, even if it is really good form. Otherwise the splash smells great and just piles on the coldness.\n\n\n\nHave a good one!\n\n\n\n**Soaps**\n\n[<< Art of Shaving - Sandalwood (NOS Valobra Tallow)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/60tcvm/wednesday_sotd_thread_mar_22_2017/df99xpr/)\n\n[Bufflehead - North York >>](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/617p0d/friday_sotd_thread_mar_24_2017/dfck9f6/)\n****\n\n**Tours**\n\n[Razor Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5lefc9/happy_new_year_sotd_thread_jan_01_2017/dbv6f4p/)\n\n[Brush Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5o322q/sunday_sotd_thread_jan_15_2017/dcgf5ud/)\n\n[Soap Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5q99m5/thursday_sotd_thread_jan_26_2017/dcxird1/)\n",

I couldn't wait to finish this shave :/ there was a strong musk smell to it right off the puck that I was not sure about. As a soap, it performs just as well as you'd expect a B&M soap to - good lather, slick, and a very smooth feeling post shaved. As for the fragrance, there are other fragrances that come through as you shave but for me it felt that the musk overpowers it. Somebody recommended that you try the A/S before making up your mind as well as give it a little time and it'll grow on you. Unfortunately, the A/S didn't appeal to me either and as such, this is simply not the soap for me. Next up - MLS Jurate\n\nI think the Gillette Super Stainless is about ready to be binned. I'm somewhere in the early teens on this blade which is remarkable as I don't think I've ever gone that long. Coincidentally (or not?) I've also almost exclusively been using tallow soaps (B&M, MLS, Bufflehead)",

Off the puck it's strong alcohol, almost rubbing alcohol with some leather behind it. Once lathered up everything else comes out and it smells just like the juice. Freaking wonderful. The lather quality is fantastic. Not sure if it's a different base than normal or if I've just forgotten how great CFG's base is. Either way really great. Still feel like lukewarm shit but getting off my ass and taking the time to shave and all that helps.",

It certainly wouldn't have been my first pick out of their scents, but it was all they had left and I wanted to try out their soap base which I've heard such good things about. The base is definitely awesome. The scent surprised me. Out of the tub, I was pretty sure I would be throwing this up on the bazaar after one use - it smelled like a really sweet peppermint mocha. As I lathered it, the sweetness was cut quite a bit though and more of the coffee started coming through. I couldn't really pick out the peppermint on its own during the shave, but I think it lent a bit of a coolness to the overall aroma. Most importantly, about halfway through the shave, I really started to notice the vetiver coming through. I'm learning that I really love vetiver. So it turns out I might very well be keeping this soap after all.\n",

I'm so excited the Chiseled face is making banana soap again I just had to use it. I'll definitely be picking up some when it comes out. The semogue got me excited for the custom brush, can't wait to have little brushbutt in my hands. /u/_drc kept speaking praises of this razor so I went out and bought one, finally got to use it and he wasn't lying, it's super smooth and super efficient. The razor is great and makes me remember by I love SEs. This was my first shave of spring because a lot has been going on, so I had to make sure it was a good one so I got a little lime, some bananas, and topped it off with some orange. Hope everyone has great shaves.",

I attribute this almost solely to the \"lavender\" scented doggy bags somebody gave us once upon a time, which made me associate that smell with dogcrap.\n\nWetshaving made me realize that *real* lavender smells nothing like that faux, synthetic lavender that's in so many household products.

It's still a bit cold in the Northeast so I needed some woods. All of this stuff just smells amazing.\n\nEdit: This was a brand new PolSilver blade and fuck it sucked. Not smooth and tuggy. I've only had a single dud before but that was a Feather and one side just wasn't sharp. Weird.\n\n\n\n\n",

Great scent! I also want to publicly than /u/Sammy_Lee at MLS for amazing customer service. She proactively reached out to me after noticing my shipping info hadn't changed in over a week, and offered to ship a replacement set. Mine arrived just after the offer, so it wasn't necessary, but still, that's just fantastic service!\n\n(For those on TSM, I apologize for the copy pasta, but her awesomeness needed as much recognition as possible)",

It took a couple of tries, but I finally managed to snag some Bufflehead. Performance was very good. Slighly less residual slickness than others, but it was my first time using a Bufflehead soap, so my water ratios could certainly be off. Direct slickness and post-shave were both excellent. Easy to load and build the lather with. From a soap base perspective, the one in reminded me of the most was Chiseled Face. Pairing was interesting. Mocha, carmel is what I got from the tub, but lathered up a more direct coffee scent bloomed. I don't really have any coffee forward fragrances, so I just opened up the tub, then started going through frags smelling it side by side trying to find something that worked. Surprisingly (or maybe not) the two best matches I had were both from Chatillon Lux. Bon Vivant wasn't a bad pairing, but Unconditional Surrender goes very well with it. They smell nothing alike, and it's not something I would have come to through intellectual analysis, but sniff one, then the other, and it's just a pleasant combination.\n\n\n\nHave a good one!\n\n\n\n**Soaps**\n\n[<< The Holy Black - Lavender Creeper](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/610l9q/thursday_sotd_thread_mar_23_2017/dfaxahj/)\n\n[Chiseled Face Groomatorium - Rhinoceros >>](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/61ekkq/saturday_sotd_thread_mar_25_2017/dfe1vuc/)\n****\n\n**Tours**\n\n[Razor Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5lefc9/happy_new_year_sotd_thread_jan_01_2017/dbv6f4p/)\n\n[Brush Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5o322q/sunday_sotd_thread_jan_15_2017/dcgf5ud/)\n\n[Soap Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5q99m5/thursday_sotd_thread_jan_26_2017/dcxird1/)\n",

Hot Summer Lavender\n\nI really like the woody notes in *Hot Summer Lavender.* The overall blend of smoky, woody lavender makes for an interesting, enticing scent profile. If pressed, I'd probably say that I enjoy this scent a bit more than *Oxford & Cambridge,* though it's really not what I think of when I think 'lavender scent'. It is really nicely put together, though.\n\nFirst Canadian makes a great soap. It's nice and slick, thirsty af, and has really good residual slickness and post-shave feel. The thing is, Czech & Speak is all of those same things, but just a bit better in each respect. Its residual slickness seems to be quite a bit better, though. Czech & Speake wins this round rather handily, but First Canadian fought a hell of a battle. Today's shave was spectacular.\n\n*Oxford & Cambridge* is the Complex/Woody Blends division champion. Tomorrow begins the Final Four round, with Reef Point's *Tranquility* facing off against Speick!\n\nHappy Friday, all!\n\n-----\nPrevious | Next\n:-|-:\n[Complex Blends, Division Championship: Czech & Speake *Oxford & Cambridge*](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/610l9q/thursday_sotd_thread_mar_23_2017/dfawms7/) | Final Four, Game 1: Reef Point Soaps *Tranquility*",

I only have samples of both Stirling Blu and Polo Blue, but figured I might as well match em while I have em.\n\nShave was a little rough today as I sort of struggled to find the right angle and stuff with the NEW. It was kinda uncomfortable during the shave, but doesn't seem to have caused much of a problem post-shave.\n\nI really love the post-shave feeling of Stirling. It's a good thing I like them considering how many samples I have from them lmao.\n\nHope everybody has a good shave and a good day!",

Yesterday used Margaritas in the arctic and I loved it. Today was executive man and, not gonna lie, I really enjoyed it as well. These soaps lather really easily and the scents are at a pleasant medium strength. The post shave balm feels great, although I wish the scent had a little more sillage. But hey, it's not a splash and the moisturizing qualities make up for it.\n\nThis is about my 6th use with the GSB and I can never get past about that amount with them. While shaving they feel fine, but afterwards my skin feels somewhat irritated. To push another use is the big question. I'll see how I feel about it tomorrow.",

It still feels great, still super smooth but no tugging whatsoever. I'm not sure what happened with Rhapsody but, when I first got it, I picked up a ton of thyme and jasmine, but now I get much more of the orange and apple, and it's incredible. This, so far, has been the only sweet scent I've attempted and loved.",

Once again, the packaging on this was just stellar quality. Just like my other Chiseled Face soaps, this one performed extremely well. I may have made a mistake trying to load the monster sized brush in the slightly smaller jar opening. Next time I'll be reaching for something a little smaller. The scent on this one is beautiful. Chiseled Face did a good job of translating the EdP to the soap, which of course was my pairing choice. The boozy caramel like notes are slightly muted from the soap base, a lightly floral element is slightly exagerated, and you don't get as much of that underlying musk and leather, which really starts coming out on the fragrance more as it begins to dry down. This was my first chance to try out a Zooligist fragrance, and I'm very glad I picked up the full sample set. I'm guessing some of these will turn into full bottles in the future.\n\n\n\nHave a good one!\n\n\n\n**Soaps**\n\n[<< Bufflehead - North York](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/617p0d/friday_sotd_thread_mar_24_2017/dfck9f6/)\n****\n\n**Tours**\n\n[Razor Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5lefc9/happy_new_year_sotd_thread_jan_01_2017/dbv6f4p/)\n\n[Brush Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5o322q/sunday_sotd_thread_jan_15_2017/dcgf5ud/)\n\n[Soap Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5q99m5/thursday_sotd_thread_jan_26_2017/dcxird1/)\n",

The other 50% of the reason Reef Point won last year was that *Classic Barbershop's* scent blend was just right for me, and I suspect that *Tranquility* has that quality as well.\n\nThat said, tomorrow it's going up against perhaps the most surprising competitor in the tournament so far: Speick. Speick has been so over-the-top amazing in this tournament that literally anything can still happen.\n\nHappy Saturday, everyone! Tomorrow we'll meet this year's first finalist.

Brush splays like heaven - I think I fell in love with face lathering. Soap smells like the water that is left in the vase once you take out the flowers and I like it. The cooling effect - I almost forgot how pleasure it is. I might have got a bit too excited because of mail call, as there were some cuts (still working on my technique).\n\nOne problem: as I swirl my brush while loading, the whole puck starts to swirl, so the whole procedure takes ages.

Spicy, sweet, refreshing. I didn't get any cucumber or aquatic notes off the soap really - maybe I'd notice them in the aftershave.\n\nStirling Spice seems to burn a bit more than other aftershaves I'm used to.

They were pretty scarce on eBay for a while but when a handful popped up during the same week, I managed to get one. I haven't had the time to do a direct comparison to my other E 2, E 3 and E 4 but this one is on par, if not better than any of them.\n\nI've heard of others just doing an ATG pass on their heads and I tried it with excellent results. A few touchups were necessary but it's as smooth as a good three pass up there.\n\nChatillon Lux's BBB makes for an excellent compliment to the wonderful T+S's Grog. It's light, slightly sweet and smells like heaven to me. Add in the fact that I can still smell it on my hands 12+ hours later despite having washed them dozens of times and I'm loving it.",

High tide at 11:02 tonight.\n\nDecided to pull a page out of /u/airbornesimian book and try out Jefferson Square once I finished off Lavendar Lizard. Both are great performers, I can see why airbornesimian had to go by smell alone. DD's Lavender Lizard takes a darker note on, not as floral as Jefferson Square. Lavender Lizard makes me think it would be what you would smell if you came upon a patch of lavender in the wilderness. While Jefferson Square, to me, is what you would smell if you were walking through a cultivated garden of lavender. Both are great scents, and both pair remarkably well with Champs de Lavande. If i was to pick up a tub of either I think the deciding factor would be: \"Which company's soaps do I have less of? Going to have to even that out.\"\n\nHave a nice Sunday!",

Where did this stuff come from? (It came from Germany, I know. It was a rhetorical question, jeez)\n\nThe performance of this cream is as good as I've seen. And that scent! The citrus, speick and lavender notes blend absolutely perfectly. This sucker just roflstomped last year's champion.\n\nActually, that's a gross exaggeration. Inasmuch as these things can be measured, I'd say that performance between these two competitors was pretty much equal. I really couldn't say whether one was notably better than the other.\n\nHowever, Speick's scent resonates with me like few other scents have, so it wins this round. On Thursday, it competes for all the marbles.\n\n-----\nPrevious | Next\n:-|-:\n[Final Four, Game 1: Reef Point Soaps *Tranquility*](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/61ekkq/saturday_sotd_thread_mar_25_2017/dfe39rh) | [Final Four, Game 2: Mickey Lee Soapworks *Jefferson Square*](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/61qwzi/monday_sotd_thread_mar_27_2017/dfgtaes/)",

Now that the soap tour is done, I'm going to finally get to spend some time getting to know the MdC soap. I've always heard nothing but great things, and am particularly pleased to be able to get to use the special Rose release to get to know it. The scent, which really opens up when lathered, is a pretty straight forward rose, with just a small peppery hint and the slight vegetal aspect of a rose plant. It's a very soft, natural smelling rose and quite pleasant. I have the sample pressed into my shave bowl, and a fairly dry brush loaded it quite easily. Add a little water, and it quickly blossoms into a very nice creamy protective lather. The glide, was great, but residual slickness wasn't quite there, and it felt a little drying. Neither of these were bad by any means, but they were just about average to me, not enough I think to justify the high price tag, at least not based on my initial impression. Initial impressions are often misleading though, and I did get a great shave, so tomorrow I think I'm going to push the water a little further to see how it reacts. I tend to under-water when I'm in unfamiliar territory, so we'll see what happens tomorrow.\n\n\n\nHave a good one!",

Feels good to be back at it. This was my first go with MWF and it was a very weird shave. Took a long time to load which I expected. I could not seem to get the lather where I wanted it. Just never got the creaminess I am used to. Decided to start a pass and see how it was, and it actually had wonderful slickness. Cushion was not amazing but it was satisfactory. Ended up getting a great shave and post shave, despite the fact that the lather almost seemed foamy rather than creamy. The end result is what matters so I have no complaints. Have a great Sunday everyone.",

I'm only using the straight for the sides of my face and neck, still don't feel comfortable enough to use it around my mouth. First pass was with the Supply to cut down several days of growth. Then I used the baseball pattern for lathering and took my time with the Clauss. The L&L was great for this, very slick and didn't break down even with the extra time taken. Still only going with the grain but I got nice results. Three passes with the straight and a follow up cleanup pass with the Supply and I'm BBS. I thought for sure the alum would burn like crazy but it only tickled in a few spots. Followed up with the Fine Green Vetiver for a great start to my Sunday. Have a great day folks!",

The lather was a bit heavier than others I'm used to, but the slickness was out of this world. Marshlands also smells amazing - pretty bummed it's discontinued, but glad I got a tub of this vetiver goodness. Excited to try the other ones I've got on the way!\n\nHope everybody has a good shave and a good day!",

Just a dusty window. This shave wasn't super great. I'm not sure what it is about that Maggard soap, but I just can't get it very slick. This particular scent is pretty odd, it reminds me very much of the smell when you slice up those baby bella mushrooms. It's certainly not a bad smell, there's a bit of something citrusy in it, my nose tells me orange but the description says grapefruit.\n\nAnyway, that soap is almost used up. I'm trying to use up the aftershave, too, as I'm not a big fan of it, but even those sample sizes last a long time!",

Holy shit I have been missing out. The sample smelled kind of lightly powdery, not very strong but pleasant, like an older lady's perfume mixed with the smell of a paperback. Then I lathered and it was amazing, the scent got much stronger and more complex, a little flowery. Lathering was so easy it was laughable, I didnt have to try at all, unlike my trader joes soap. I then proceeded to have the best shave of my life so far. The lather was so slick, and my razor just glided over my face like it was nothing. The best part is that my face felt moisturized afterwards, not a sad, dry place.\n\nIs this what all the nice soaps are like? Because if so I'm mad I've been wasting time with lesser products.",

I've been dying to shave with it since I got it, which is more than can be said for the set he received from me.\nThat said, curse all ye who are selling/trading me soaps. I've gotten serious SAD and literally have changed my shaving pattern because i was so eager to try out the soap. I don't shave on a Sunday preferring instead to shave on Monday in preparation for the work-week yet here we are - clean-shaved and less hobo-like than is appropriate for Sunday.\n\nThe shave itself was mixed today - too many new things - the Kong is a monster sized brush when compared to my regular Maggard 22mm, I usually shave with #3 on the Rockwell but went with 4 today and the Derby - a blade i'm trying after well over a year reminded me why I haven't touched it for so long. And there's MLS Jurate. I love the scent - it's exotic, it's got layers, it's making my nose do things I didn't think it could do. and i can still smell the A/S 5 hours later. Sadly, I again got that slightly tingling sensation, like bad razor-burn, that I got with the Drunken Goat. My initial experience with MLS made me think something about it doesn't agree with my face but that time I attributed it to a dying blade not the soap itself. I'll be heartbroken if that is the case because Drunken Goat is one of my favorite scents. What makes it worse is that today I don't know if it was the blade, the #4 or MLS that caused the problem.\n\nIn sum - next shave it's back to #3, with my favorite blade (Gillette platinum black from India) and another round with the MLS.",

It's not as splay-proof as I remember, but it certainly has a LOT of backbone. It did the job just fine with a fair amount of scrubbiness and a tiny bit of scritch when I applied a bit more pressure. I don't dislike this brush at all, but it's temperamental. [Edit: The handle has something to be desired. It doesn't seem as small in the pictures as it really is, leaving it a bit uncomfortable. If I had paid for a 2 band Badger and discovered this I would probably be more bothered by it than I am. ]\n\nHad to go to the Reunion today...so good!!!\n\nHope everyone is having a great weekend =)",

Not a negative by any means. I do like a lot of variation.\n\nThe Baby Smooth is a great travel razor. Not only is it light, it's also effortless. The feel on the face is similar to the Alumigoose. Almost as if the blade is creating a suction effect on the skin - the blade can't get any closer.\n\nThe Paladin is breaking in nicely. It's still holding lather a little but the face feel in combination with the backbone is fantastic.\n\nThe transition from the DD lemon meringue to the Cedrat is perfect. A break in the L'Occitane rotation to match the scent to the soap. It's too good to miss out.\n\nHave a great day people :D",

It lingers around me for hours, it smells up the bathroom even though I only let it sit for a few minutes after my shave before putting it back in the cupboard.\n\nI can't even say that it's a pleasant scent - it's not light citrus or a field of wildflowers, it's not a nice clean barbershop or a a rich gourmet.\n\nIt's a punch square in the face and if you don't like it, screw you because it's not going anywhere.\n\nPersonally, I love it. Results may vary.\n\nThe mongoose is straight up the best thing that exists. We can fight about it, but I'm right so you'll just be fighting yourself and won't that look stupid?\n\nI've been cutting Rhino with something light and chill like Nivea or Hardy Shave balm, but neither of those are animals, are they?\n\nHave a great Monday, everyone!",

Gtb and kraken were some of my first soaps and they're still some of my favorites.\n\nI got this brush last week to see how the synthetic knot has evolved since plisson style knots were the \"best.\" The tuxedo has a little more backbone than my maggard synthetic which I like, and the tips are just as soft. They're both great and I see no reason to not use either. The \"machine\" handle from turtleship shave co. Is awesome too, both in terms of looks and how it feels in hand. Definitely one of a kind.\n\nFirst time using the Rockwell and a Rockwell blade. I had some irritation around my chin/neck post shave. First instinct is to blame the blade since it's new to me, but it may just as well have been a slightly dry lather or me not being used to the heft of this razor. I'll give it a few more tries and see what happens. I really like the 6s so far. Aside from the merkur 23c I gave to my brother, it's my only currently-produced de. It feels substantial and I hope with the right blade it'll give me comfortable and close shaves in the near future.",

Was it possible? Yes. Was it pleasant? Not really. I got some irritation. Also, the after shave burned really bad lol.\n\nSpeaking of aftershave, all these old spice scents I have come from india, they all smell nice out of the bottle, but on the face they smell like really cheap colognes, or body spray. Post shave is nice though.\n\n6th use of Horse hair brush, the tips are getting much softer, but the brush still has that funk.\n\nHave a great day guys :)",

Your inability to lay down rich, creamy, yogurty lather on my prepped skin has been an ongoing problem. It's not me. It's you. And you've got to go.\n\nI gave my father-in-law my prized Maggard Razors 24mm purple handle brush. Along with a barely used tub of T+S Grog and a moderately used tub of Reef Point Soaps Admiralty. Neither soap was going to see much action in my den, so it was time for them to be sold or given away. My FIL has been using a variety of safety razors that I have gifted to him starting in 2008, but I never got him to consider adding a brush and soap to his regimen. Well, thankfully, something changed. He seemed genuinely intrigued this weekend and seemed to be very happy when I handed over the goods to him. Time will tell if he's really into it or if he was just being nice.",

Still performed quite effeciently, but it felt tame, like a little baby kitten. I pushed this MdC further with the water today and it improved slightly, particularly the residual slickness. Still not the best, but better than yesterday. Post-shave is still rather drying to my skin though. I'll also take back my comment on not being worth the higher price. The density and effeciency of this soap is quite impressive. The price is higher, but you're going to get a lot of milage out of a tub of MdC. It may take a while to get through this sample.\n\nWith the floral soap, it seemed like a good time to try out one of the more floral fragrances from zoologist. I know there are quite a few, heavy woody and animalic manly scents in the zoologist line up, but honestly this was the one I was most interested in trying. I've developed quite a soft spot for the florals since I started wet shaving, and something floral seemed appropriate for pairing with the MdC Rose. This one is a beautiful scent for the spring time. The opening top notes, with the plum and florals, are almost reminiscent of sweet tarts. Sweet, but not cloyingly so, and a bit powdery. Underneath that, a resinous musky scent starts to develop for the dry down, which helps to ground it. It certainly leans into what would traditionally be called feminine, but don't let that stop you from giving it a sample, especially if you enjoy anything floral. I'm sitting here swimming in it. I actually prefer this one by quite a bit over the Rhinoceros.\n\n\n\nHave a good one!",

I got a great lather with the soap and it felt significantly different than I remember. Overall super pleased with the performance (I always did like the scent). So thanks you /u/jdubba you got me to try a soap that was just sitting in my cabinet for a while, I'll probably start using it more often now.",

This won't be the last Chiseled Face soap purchase for sure. I'm really eyeing Ghost Town Barber now.\n\nI am still trying different a/s combinations with Rhino and so far Bon Vivant seems to be my favorite. I went with La Quatrieme Ville on this one and was not a fan right out of the bottle, but after about 30 minutes this scent seemed to morph into something that was quite enjoyable. I'm thinking the vetiver was more up front upon application, but settled down after a few minutes. I'm not a huge fan of vetiver, but give this one 30 minutes and it's really singing. My wife seemed to like it too, and since she rarely comments on aftershaves that's a very good sign.\n\nSo far with Rhino I've tried 3 aftershaves, all of those being CL. I'd rank them in this order:\n\n1. Bon Vivant\n2. Gratiot League Square\n3. La Quatrieme Ville\n\nThat said, I really liked GLS a few hours after application (seems a bit too \"boozy\" at first), so I'm definitely going to revisit that one with Rhino in the near future. Another thing I have to remember is the scent strength with CL. I tend to get a little heavy handed with aftershaves and I need to remember that you don't need a ton of CL product to get good results. That might have been my issue with GLS. I had that same problem with Bon Vivant, but once I figured out how much product to use, it's been great.",

I was in a hell of a rush, this morning, and my kiddo needed me a lot while I was trying to shower, shave and get us ready to go. As a result, I severely under-loaded my brush and made a relatively weak lather, but as I didn't have time to monkey around re-loading and such I just rolled with it. *Jefferson Square* looked me in the face and said, \"Imperfect lather? [Look at all the fucks I give](http://i.imgur.com/FAQDh0f.jpg).\"\n\nThen it proceeded to hold up through a 7-minute, 3-pass BBS shave, the 3rd pass which was done on residual slickness alone. What little extra lather I was able to squeeze out of my brush was more like proto-lather, but I put it on anyway because ***dat lavender blend***.\n\nIt seems as though Mickey Lee has been getting the short end of the stick when it comes to stuff messing with my shave, and it's taken all of the flak, laughed and marched right along, delivering a few of the best shaves I could hope for. That's pretty fucking impressive.\n\nCzech & Speake really needs to bring its A-game tomorrow, because this one is gonna be tough to beat.\n\n-----\nPrevious | Next\n:-|-:\n[Final Four, Game 1: Speick](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/61kkwj/sunday_sotd_thread_mar_26_2017/dffdivl) | [Final Four, Game 2: Czech & Speake *Oxford & Cambridge*](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/61y2ua/tuesday_sotd_thread_mar_28_2017/dfihl81/)",

Wasn't planning on buying anything, but I couldn't resist after getting a sniff of Through the Woods. That leads me to this morning's SOTD:\n\n- Soap: Mickey Lee Soapworks - Through the Woods\n- Aftershave: MLS - Through the Woods\n- Razor: Rockwell 6s\n- Blade: Rapira Platinum Lux\n- Brush: Stirling 24mm finest fan in butterscotch\n\nI've got a few MLS soaps in my den already, with Drunken Goat being in my top 5, but even so, I was surprised and amazed at Though the Woods. It seemed like the moment the brush hit the soap that I had enough lather for my shave. I kept going anyways, just to make sure and I think I whipped up one of the best lathers I've ever seen.\nThe Rockwell and Rapira performed great as always giving me a BBS shave with no irritation. 3 hours after I shaved I can still smell the aftershave, though it's mild, and very relaxing. It's great for a Monday morning in the office. The post shave feel is great as expected from MLS soaps and aftershaves.",

On Saturday I received the pass-around tub of T&S Dark. This was the first time I'd had the opportunity to use a T&S soap and it performed wonderfully. The lather was top notch: creamy, slick and certainly in the top tier of the soaps that I've tried. I found the scent pleasing with the coffee, cocoa, and peppermint coming to the forefront to my sniffer. Great post shave face feel.\n\nWithout any Dark AS to finish the shave, it seemed Leviathan would be the no-brainer to bring it all together. The Leviathan AS paired wonderfully with the Dark soap. Great shave.\n\nSpecial thanks to /u/MrAdamLerner for organizing this great pass-around.",

Using up one of the Proraso samples I picked up from Maggard early on in my shave journey. Works pretty well and the Blue at least seems to deliver pretty good post-shave feel. Haven't tried the red or green just yet.\n\nRefocused on applying little to no pressure with the NEW and got a better shave. I think switching between different razors while still being a relative newbie at this is slightly problematic. I ought to pick one and use it for a while to get really practiced with it and just remove one variable from my shaves at least until I have a bit more experience. The only problem is choosing which of my razors that would be - Maggard Slant, Gillette Slim, Gillette NEW, Razorock Baby Smooth. Tough choice, but I'll try to make it in the coming days.\n\nMy Bandwagon and TSM Fougere from /u/landlgrooming came in the mail just after I got done shaving! These new labels look super snazzy. I'm having trouble getting much of a read on Bandwagon right off the puck - I smell a bit of sweetness, almost like some kind of pastry, but...not really that sweet...I dunno. That's probably the one I'll use tomorrow to satisfy my curiosity. TSM Fougere also smells incredible - I'll probably pick up a bottle of the aftershave from /u/hawns when I inevitably order Colonia Balsamica.",

We are still trying to identify it and are without gas (no hot water, no stove, etc)\n**High**: Using Cade with cold water gave me the best post-shave feel ever, even better than SdM.

I need a fantastic shave for tomorrow (today? whenever I wake up around noon) to block out what just happened. This is the lineup to do it. I got home from work and when I went to throw my car into reverse (2009 Jetta w/5-speed manual transmission and 2.5L 5-cylinder engine) it just shifted into first. I took my car around the block and the 5th gear was being finicky. Well, I started digging around the engine bay for an hour and played with the linkage. After fingering the linkage (giggity) for some time I started my car up and I was able to shift into all gears. My guess is that the cables are loose. I'll have to mess with it more when it is actually light out (so not at 3:30 am when I get home from work) and I am not tired.",

It's the only soap that doesn't perform well enough for me, and I keep ending up with razor burn when I use it. There are too many great soaps out there to spend time on one that doesn't work for me, I know many people love it, but it's not for me.\n\nToday is tabac Tuesday, no more should need to be said, incredible lather, awesome slickness, and I love the scent. It's my first day with the supply injector so I will get a few more days out of it before I make any claims about the razor.\n\nHave a great day everyone, enjoy your shaves, and I hope you use tabac.\n",

This fought a hard battle against Reunion for top spot among my MLS soaps and it remains the champion. I'm always amazed at how much of an impact a lather can make on a shave with an over-the-hill blade. I mixed it a little thicker today for the first pass and there was almost no tugging. For the subsequent passes I added my usual amount of water. I might be able to go past 80 on this blade if I adopted this practice. Nah...80 is the limit. Not. One. More. Gotta get out into Tuesday.",

Bandwagon definitely smells better/more interesting once lathered, but I wasn't really able to pay it the attention it deserves with this shave, so I'll have to go back to it in the next few days. Performs amazingly of course. Super slick and awesome post shave feeling.\n\nAs I get more comfortable with the NEW, I'm finding it a very smooth shaver.\n\nExcited about a couple things I picked up from the bazaar yesterday. Got a Stirling Badger brush and an almost full set of Leviathan coming probably this week :)\n\nHave a good day and good shaves, everybody!",

As such, my lather game was about as weak as yesterday's, and I thought, *this would be an interesting test given yesterday's lather,* so I went with it anyway.\n\nYesterday, when I had ill prepared my lather, *Jefferson Square* just held my face in its hands and said, \"No worries; I got you, bae.\" Today, *Oxford & Cambridge* said, \"Well, this'll just have to do, then.\" I still got a smooth, irritation-free shave, but the shave wasn't quite as comfortable as yesterday's, and that lack of relative comfort definitely wasn't on the blade.\n\nJust for kicks, I let the soap's residual slickness handle my touch-ups, and it still performed well. It just wasn't quite as good at handling everything in that state as I'd have liked. From what I've seen so far, Czech & Speake is a soap that really needs time and attention. If you're able/willing to make the capital investment, it will reward you with an exceptional shave. This isn't to say that today's shave wasn't good, but it definitely wasn't exceptional. Sometimes you just have a need for speed, and a soap that lathers super fast and well has its place at those times.\n\nSo, there you have it. Mickey Lee's *Jefferson Square* wins pretty handily in this match, and will face Speick, tomorrow, for the title!\n\n-----\nPrevious | Next\n:-|-:\n[Final Four, Game 2: Mickey Lee Soapworks *Jefferson Square*](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/61qwzi/monday_sotd_thread_mar_27_2017/dfgtaes/) | [Championship Match: Speick](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/625ci0/wednesday_sotd_thread_mar_29_2017/dfk0h5i/)",

I enjoyed my first use of Bandwagon. It's definitely not one of those more citrusy \"barbershops\" like Seville or Tonsorial Parlour for me, I get a lot of the sandalwood and powdery-musk base. For some reason it's really reminding me of Brut Original.. Maybe because of some shared notes (sandalwood, lavender, bergamot, anise)? I don't know.. But it's nice either way and I don't even like Brut hah.\n\nThis is also Scott's first alcohol splash and I like it. I don't really like the bite of alcohol and thus doesn't, probably due to there being more botanicals. For me, it has a good amount of menthol - enough to feel, but not face freezing. Now I can't wait for Mayflower, whatever the hell is happening in June, and that sweet mentholated Southern Paradise.",

Sorry guys. It's good but not THAAT good. Even TTS was telling me that I'd like it. And I do, but I'm not about to go *Roamosexual* or anything.\n\nMaybe it's the Petrichor. I don't think I like Petrichor as much as TTS thinks I do. B&M Petrichor is supposed to be 4.5 score for me. Does it have any scent notes other than Damp Earth?\n\nDemeter Thunderstorm is pretty boring. It does one job though and it does it well. It smells of Petrichor.\n\nAlright - been nice knowing you.

The Nacet is always a good blade for me, and I get some of the most consistently smooth and close shaves from it.\n\nFor the soap, I see a ton of people who get a very woodsy scent from Hallows. Noses are kinda strange I guess, cause I've only really smelled a somewhat smoky cocoa all the way through. Not complaining though, I love dark chocolate...",

Loving the Rockwell and the 26mm badger brush. I like the scent of Ozark Mountain, but not sure I want to smell like it for hours after my shave. About to buy some blades in bulk, but stuck on the fence if I want Polsilvers or Gillette Silver Blues. Maybe I'll get both...\n\nGreat shave! Need to try a few passes with the Rockwell on plate 3, then do the clean up with plate 1 or 2. I'd like to try that and see if it helps with the tiny bit of irritation I get.",

They must have returned it because it did show up...\n\nThe AV balm is interesting. I find the consistency to be more watery than most balms. It absorbs in a few minutes and while it does a good job of moisturizing, it pales in comparison to Dapper Dragon and Chatillon Lux, my favorites. It also doesn't seem to leave my skin feeling soft and hydrated for long either. The scent is fantastic but short lived. Every time I would smell it, it would remind me of Stirling Sandpiper and after applying both, it's pretty damn similar to my nose. I just wish the balm's scent would last more than an hour.\n\nHave a great day!",

A lot of twists, turns, surprises and upsets have happened on the way here. First up is Speick, and it definitely brought its A-game this morning. A moderate amount of the cream drank so much water and generated so much lather than I could have wallpapered my bathroom with it. I decided to shave, instead.\n\nThat shave was utterly effortless. So much so that there really isn't much to comment on. The razor zipped through two passes and then I was BBS. It was the kind of performance that you just watch in silence, and then clap appreciatively afterward.\n\nMickey Lee has its work cut out, but I'm sure it'll be up to the task. This is going to be a match worthy of the championship.\n\n-----\nPrevious | Next\n:-|-:\n[Final Four, Game 2: Czech & Speake *Oxford & Cambridge*](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/61y2ua/tuesday_sotd_thread_mar_28_2017/dfihl81/) | [Championship Match: Mickey Lee Soapworks *Jefferson Square*](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/62cmwt/thursday_sotd_thread_mar_30_2017/dfllqws/)",

Seemed to dial in the angle a little better, still missed some areas but that's okay.\n\n\n\nTonsorial Parlor is an interesting \"barbershop\" scent to say the least. Super sharp citrus with a slight hint of floral and powder is what I get from this soap. Not your standard barbershop or citrus scented soap. Always get great performance from CB's soap base, definitely my top performing vegan base.\n\n\n\nAs for B&M RC, the longevity for this A/S is what kills it for me. Currently, its been about an hour after I shaved and I can already tell the scent is fading. Personally, I prefer to have the scent stay with me all throughout work. We'll see what today brings.\n\n\n\n**Have a great shave everyone!**",

I've been really looking forward to this since the first mention I heard of it. Wholly Kaw took his already fantastic tallow base, and improved and tweaked with the addition of ass milk. Initial impressions from others seemed to indicate that indeed the formula was even better than the standard tallow. Indeed they were right. Today was arguably one the best shaves I've ever had. After a couple of days I had my technique with the V3A dialed back in. Fresh 7 O'Clock Black locked and loaded, then the magic happened: Monaco Royale. Simply amazing stuff. Somehow, this took it to another level. Pretty much everything great about the original tallow base, plus better texture, with an unreal post-shave feel. Go hit up /u/Huckleberryking's initial impressions post for more details, but this is some fantastic stuff. How's the scent? This is how my brain put it to me when I was lathering. If Brut and Old Spice (the original good stuff) had a baby, it would be Monaco Royale. It was quite pleasant. I took /u/hawns lead and followed up with the TSM Fougère, which was a great complement.\n\n\n\nHave a good one!",

I literally said \"what the fuck\" out loud during my first pass - I guess it paid off to hydrate it more than I originally planned to. I don't remember my other WK soap being like this so I'm guessing the donkey milk had a lot to do with it. Props to /u/whollykaw for this release because (based on first impressions), this is probably one of the best (if not the best) performing soaps I own now. Unlike /u/hawns I've been an ass man and this just puts icing on the cake :)",

This is a handle that I chased for well over a year before I finally found one. Such a beauty, and it provides more grip than you'd expect with the finish. But man is it heavy!! LoL Rhino performed very well today. This soap is so easy to lather, it's ridiculous. The scent is still as amazing as ever and today I'm wearing its matching frag. So nice! Probably a little too bold for the office but NO GUTS, NO GLORY!!\n\nHave a great day everyone!",

Haven't used the Semogue 620 in a while. Had a bear of a time breaking it in, but it's finally hitting it's stride. Always forget I need to load more soap than my synthetic or my badger though, but once loaded adequately, it's a real pleasure to use!\n\nMike's has been great for me. It's a newcomer to my den. It's quite thirsty though. I start with a dry brush and add water as needed. Great glide, cushion, and post shave feel. Dare I say, it's slicker than Stirling for me.\n\nRockwell 6S with plate 3 and a GSB is nice and efficient. Plate 2 tames it a bit and allows for more buffing and what not. Not a bad combo.\n\nReally enjoy the L'Orange Noir. Great scent, and the fragrance oils seems to moisture my face? I think that's what I'm feeling.\n\nAnyway, ready for another day with a good shave!",

I think I could get rid of all my other razors and use this one exclusively, it's that good. It's supposed to be 60 and sunny today so I thought citrus was appropriate I let my wife pick and this is what we got. She loves YRP so I'm not surprised with that. All in all a great shave on a beautiful day. Hope everyone has good shaves.",

I have been craving it since yesterday evening. I think because the last couple days here have been pretty warm for the season, I was wanting something bright and fresh. Seville did not disappoint today. The lather was tremendous and the scent really hit the spot. I knew that Cologne Russe paired well with it, so I went that route. I have a backup bottle of Russe a/s, so I don't feel guilty using it with other soaps.\n\nI decided to break out the straight today as well. My straights haven't gotten much love lately and since I'm off work this week I've got the time to devote to that kind of shave. I did my first pass with the Heljestrand and then a second pass with my Slim and one final touch up pass after that.\n\nSlim was dialed into \"3\" with a brand new Feather loaded. I usually set my slim on \"7\" or above, but I know fresh Feathers can be harsh. Set on \"3\" it was incredibly comfortable. I'm thinking I might just leave it there for tomorrow's shave just to see how it does.",

I get a little less blade feel from it than the E models (the B and C models, I have to visually check for a blade since I don't feel it at all) but it's still quite efficient.\n\nWound up with some irritation at the base of my skull from the head shave where I think I'm inadvertently applying pressure because of how I hold the razor there. The Chatillon Lux salve calmed the irritation right down and within the hour, no more redness or heat. That stuff is pure magic and if you've never tried it, you NEED to.\n\nHave a great day!",

Although I have moved on to better artisan soaps, but deep down Arko will always occupy a special position in my heart.\n\nAs for the razor, ATT Calypso is just legit good stuff. It is like a level up of standard razor. Honestly, i think my personal preference is light razors so aluminium razors give me the best results. Maybe i should adjust my grail razor to an aluminium wolf man.\n\nLast of all, enjoy your shave and enjoy your day people ! Weekend is around the corner.",

Tune in tomorrow and see.\n\n-----\nPrevious | Next\n:-|-:\n[Championship Match: Speick](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/625ci0/wednesday_sotd_thread_mar_29_2017/dfk0h5i/) | [Lavender Lunacy Awards Ceremony](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/62jxxj/friday_sotd_thread_mar_31_2017/dfnhxzg/)",

Thus, I got to spend all day inside at the hospital. Such is life. He's alright thankfully - nothing too major, took him in more to be on the safe side.\n\nI was really impressed by how the NEW hacked through 48 hours' worth of growth. I only needed two passes with a slight bit of cleanup around the jawline. The more I get accustomed to this razor, the more I see why lots of people really dig them.\n\nHope everybody has a good day and good shave!",

The scent reminds me of one of Chatillon Lux salves I used to own, but for the life of me, I can't remember which one. (DAMN YOU, BRAIN!) Anyhow, it isn't my favorite scent (an earthy, warm spice cake) but it's not bad. The performance is what I was really interested in and it came through in spades. Really great soap base. Checks all the boxes for a top-tier soap. Excellent post shave feel as well. Great Thursday shaves to all.",

Lathered up each using a different brush and then shaved. Here are a few quick takeaways: Scent on the MR is definitely better than the SdM but not great; I actually the clean/fresh scent of SdM but not enough that it inspires me to shave with it if not for the stellar performance. They lather up a little differently, the SdM was foamy and kind of thin while the MR was much thicker but not voluminous. The blade glided on the SdM side like it was on an oil slick; the MR side was more of a standard feel, incredibly less slick than SdM. This could have been due to lather consistency and I will be testing further. After the first pass, I wiped both sides of my face; again the SdM had much more residual slickness but the MR had a noticeable amount that I would be happy with.\nSo SdM won this round pretty hands down, MR only really winning in the scent category. Normally, scent would be the determining factor for in a soap, especially since MR performed very well. However, ass milk is about one thing and one thing only: performance. Due to the deficiencies in scent, I wouldn't keep either of these soaps around unless they outperformed my assless soaps by a decent margin - and they do. I'll continue to test them against each other to see which one stays in the den for when I want extra pampered. Next test I will perform a full shave with the same setup on each on back to back days, trying to take notes.\n\nRound 2 | Round 3\n----------- | ------------\n[Monaco Royale](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/63cu5s/tuesday_sotd_thread_apr_04_2017/dft6jkz/) | [La Savonniere du Moulin](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/63k84h/wednesday_sotd_thread_apr_05_2017/dfuwphx/)",

If you haven't tried Dapper Dragon, in particular the scale polish, I would highly recommend them.\n\n",

I looked in the guest bath cabinet and found a travel size can of Barbasol. Turned out to be a great shave. I attribute that to technique. When I used to use canned foam or gel I think I just kind of slathered it on and shave. The last two days I took a little time massaging it in and had great results. Not as enjoyable as my usual routine but still damn fine shaves.",

Not sure if it's not broken in yet, or what, but it kills lather dead! It's probably got about 30 shaves total on it, but man, it's miserable to use. So I broke out my Razorock Plissoft. I'll continue to work on breaking this brush in. Can't be any worse than my Semogue 620, which I've come to really like (after it was broken in, of course).\n\nShave itself was great! First 2 passes were on plate 3, then switched to plate 1 for the final pass and clean up. It was too mild, I believe. Maybe I'll do a 3-2-1 shave tomorrow. Plate 3 for 2 passes, plate 2 for the 3rd pass, then plate 1 for cleanup. Either way, it's fun to play around with the Rockwell 6S and see what works best!",

Finally got some downtime and decided to work on a sample I've had laying around. I love the scent of Piacenza, not a sweet orange, more like the zest. As always the performance is wonderful. I was, however, a little disappointed with the Stirling synthetic, it doesn't seem to have much backbone and is harsh against my face when I try to splay it. Oh well, it will make a nice travel brush!\n\nHave a good one folks, tomorrow's Friday!",

Wanted to give it a try but seeing as I hadn't shaved since Sunday I felt like using something nicer than the matching Red cream. MLS Unforgiven is a fantastic smoky, woody, western themed scent and it went nicely with the sweeter sandalwood scent of the Red splash. It's a shame Unforgiven didn't get much love.\n\n\nAvvagoodweekend!",

Cade exploded like it always does and performed wonderfully, the whole experience was relaxing and enjoyable. Now it's off to work for what I'm sure will be a lovely Friday.\n\nHave a great day everyone",

As soon as I open the tub that wonderful scent hits me and I can't get enough of it. Using this big (to me) brush produced way too much lather for four passes. Oh well. I can think of worse things.\n\nOkay, so I hit 80 on the Polsilver today. I vowed to pitch it today. (Sighs) I think I'm going to keep it for a little while longer. I mean, what the hell? It's still not causing irritation and I can still get a close shave with it...so why not? I've gotten 3 people at work to use DE and have given them blades to get started with. None of them follow forums and two of them still use canned shit for lather. All of them use their blades way longer than 90% of the people on the forums. That inspired me to keep going with this blade. Sooooo glad it's Friday.",

I didn't feel like I wanted any post shave of any kind, but I just added it anyways. Smelling off the puck I didn't really love it, but it smelt pleasant (I have no expert nose). Once I lathered up though I loved the scent, I got notes of citrus, cinnamon, tobacco, and sandalwood (I think).\n\n\n\nWeirdly enough last night my body must have been telling me something because I fell asleep at 6:30pm right after getting home from work.

I'm going to go out on a limb and say that Sammy's new formula is my favorite soap base. It's super easy to use, has a wide range of usable hydration, and always just wraps me in the warm embrace of a familiar lover.\n\n*Jefferson Square* is a great lavender scent. It's pure lavender, although it's a blend of four different types. That gives it a nice, purely lavender scent that also has a lot of depth, which makes it incredibly interesting given that I tend to gravitate toward more complex bouquets.\n\nThe previous two shaves were fucking fantastic. Speick showed up and owned every aspect of its performance. I adore its scent, and the cream's performance has been nothing short of astounding to me all the way through the tournament. That shave was just effortless and flawless from head to toe. Literally all I could do while shaving was marvel at just how good that stuff was.\n\nI'll admit, after that shave, I was ready to just hand over the crown. I seriously couldn't imagine how anything would outperform it.\n\nThen *Jefferson Square* showed up yesterday, and really did exactly the same thing: effortlessly annihilated my stubble while caressing my face and whispering sweet nothings into my ear. That lavender blend is seriously teh s3x.\n\nOn paper, it looks like that last match came down to a scent preference, but after this morning's shave with *Jefferson Square* again, it feels like a bit more than that. This is a soap that does for me what *Night Music, Green Dragon, Lavanille* and *Ghost Town Barber* do; it really draws me into the shaving experience and keeps me there for the duration. I really like the scent blend, but I think the combination of that and the base is really what seals it for me.\n\nThis was a well-deserved victory that was 100% earned.\n\nI have a ton of thoughts whirling 'round in my head about the tournament at large, but those are not yet coherent, so they'll wait for their own post. That'll probably happen tomorrow or Sunday. For now, I'm just going to bask in this elegant fucking shave and try to get some work done so I don't keep watching the clock tick away the minutes until my date tonight.\n\nEnjoy your Friday, everyone.\n\n-----\nPrevious | Next\n:-|-:\n[Championship Match: Mickey Lee Soapworks *Jefferson Square*](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/62cmwt/thursday_sotd_thread_mar_30_2017/dfllqws/) | Lavender Lunacy: Recap",

I like the scent of the Sharply Dressed man more, but it's less strong. Good lather; I'm working on using a light touch with the brush when face lathering. Air seems to work into the lather more easily with light pressure on the brush's tips.\n\nThe slant is nice, but I'm still getting used to it. Mostly a good shave, but a couple of irritated areas at the bottom of the chin (announced by the alum). Might take tomorrow off and concentrate on my technique for Sunday.",
