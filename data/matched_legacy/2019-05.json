I let TTS pick my soap for the day, so Chocolate Bourbon was the choice. All PAA jokes and self-made drama aside, I like this base better than the CK-6 samples I have tried and feel like it's just a notch under Southern Witchcrafts as far as vegan bases go. Chocolate Bourbon is one of my favorite scents, but the aftershave definitely leaves a bit of a burn on my face. I usually add balm after, so that takes away most of it, but I think the Rose Water doesn't like my face.\n\nWhat a great cover of a tremendous song!

I wanted a vegan soap with menthol, and thanks to trythatsoap I found Fern Concerto. I'd seen a lot of positive sentiment about WK, albeit mostly for their tallow base. So I decided to give it a try and it showed up yesterday.\n\nMy first impressions are very positive. I like the scent a lot. It's fresh and green with plenty of citrus, particularly from the toner. The performance is splendid. I messed up on the first pass by not adding enough water, leading to a rather thin lather. I added more for the second pass and it bloomed into a wonderfully thick and slick lather.\n\nThe synthetic menthol is lovely. It's not as face melting as a Cryogen or even a Margaritas in the Arctic, but it's wonderfully cooling and soothing, particularly on the second pass onwards. All in all I'm very happy with my purchase and can see Fern Concerto being in heavy rotation for me as the weather heats up.\n\nI saw Avengers yesterday. My big problem with it? Captain America uses a cartridge razor. The dude grew up before WWII - surely he'd have a vintage Gillette, right?!",

The brush makes a great lather really easily, the tips are really soft but the backbone is slightly too soft.\n\nTried the sample of Blenheim Bouquet I brought and it's interesting. It took me a while to place where I'd smelt the scent before, eventually I realised it was the moist towelette you get in an Indian Restaurant after your meal. It has a great lemon kick to it with a slightly floral hint at the end. Whilst it's a bit disappointing to have a high end fragrance smell like I've just eaten a Lamb Dhansak the other way of looking at it is that the moist towelette business has a great fragrance department. If money was no object I'd definitely look for a whole bottle of the splash or EdP, but for the price it might have to be a grudging pass.",

Tomorrow I think I'll dig into my samples (I've had them since I bought the NO starter kit) and practice loading them.\n\nStill trying to figure out lather games participation. Honestly all my gear is JUST from NO. Might be low enough on my pick to justify some samples before we start (I've stuck to frugal route so far and only have one puck at a time). That or I'll be the chump with one point at the end :p. Either way will be fun to participate how I can!",

I'm on the fence for now. But star was the brush. This Omega finally got enough uses/soak time under it's belt to get into the \"comfortable\" zone.\n\n#### ❧ Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Gillette - Sheraton 1938 ::: Gillette - Nacet ‹148 uses›)*\n\nChugging along. Nice close shave. Minimal tugging, even on this 1.5 day growth. No irritation.\n\n#### ❧ Soap Notes\n*^(Henri et Victoria Vegan - Fougere)*\n\nThis one is more floral smelling off the dry puck than it is while shaving. The scent has some woodiness and maybe some green to it that softens the florals, so I'm going to keep this one around for a few more shaves. Besides, it's good to expand your horizons every once in a while. I can see some thinking it's too floral, though.\n\nScent: floral component for sure, but enough other stuff to keep me from passing it on... for now.\n\nScent Strength: 5/10, nicely present during shaving.\n\nThis lather was thin right before it was hydrated correctly. Almost fooled me. But once on my face, I knew it needed a bit more water. Slick feel and great glide for razor. Nice face feel after the shave too.\n\n1/4- tsp soap + lightly-wet boar brush + 3.25 tsp water = 6 passes of lather.\n\nBowl - I used the XL version of this bowl:\nhttps://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3392930\n\n#### ❧ Brush Notes\n*^(Omega - 10098 Boar‹13 uses›)*\n\nmuch more comfy that used to be. Still a few prickles coming through. so a bit more splitting of the tips will be nice. 40 min soak before this shave.\n\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Cut flush to where I just see the tips (above average for me)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm)\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

Very legal, very cool.\n\n\nThe blade didn't exceed my average expectations. The hunt continues. I wonder if I'm hoping for too much.\n\n\n*The Song:* I'm not crazy about it, but I really like the long list of guests. They're all awesome.",

(To tell the truth, my soundtrack song was finished before I ever got a razor to my face tonight.) Finally got enough slickness on my face to get some decent glide with my razor but my face feels friggin sore post-shave, even after applying balm. I spent all this effort just to get mediocre results when I get better results with Stirling and Cella on days where I'm lazy with my lather. Time to put Noble Otter away until it's needed again for the Lather Games.\n\nThird time using this scent and I still really only get pine and frankincense out of it. I don't get the heavy \"dirt\" note that /u/K1986 gets, which is interesting because our samples are both from the same tub.\n\nThe Lord Platinum did a good job though. Sharper and smoother than any other Lord blades I've tried so far. At least as good as Astra Superior Platinum for a first shave.",

This scent deserves much more attention. It sort of reminds me of Brut with its powdery vanilla note, but it's way more sophisticated and appealing. It's the perfect scent for spring and summer. I waited a while to get this, and I'm so glad I finally did. It's definitely become a favorite.",

The lime in it is not too bright and just the right amount of freshness. I worked in the lather better this time - it seems that even though the lather looks shiny and ready on my brush, I painted a tad more water on my face. The razor glide was pretty damn good. Post-shave was okay - no dryness felt.\n\nEnded the shave with Contemplation AS which makes my skin feel great! The scent was a bit more floral than I expected sniffing the bottle but it didn't last that long either. I seem to be coming down with a cold so maybe that had something to do with it.\n\nNacet still performing excellent.\n\nDreary May day weather here today - cold, windy and rain - definitely doesn't help with the cold. This is bad set up for a vacation week next week. GF and I still haven't booked anything but looking at Punta Cana and Riviera Maya for an all-inclusive. Gotta look up which place has more activities going on... (I just wanna do nothing though!)\n\nHappy hump day!",

The new base is really good and the post shave is fantastic.\n\nFleur d'Oranger is a Citrus and floral fragrance with a orange and musk base. The lavender and jasmine notes make me feel like it's spring.\n\nI'm doing some prep work for the games and even though life is busy, I'm looking forward to the fun. I'm in need of a shaves worth of Mammoth Soaps if anyone cares to share or trade. I don't believe there's a drop between now and the games?",

I went for 3 full passes for the first time today and may have substitute the ATG pass for another XTG pass. Not a ton irritation but much more noticeable than when I was skipping the ATG pass.\n\nThe NO base is fantastic and I love the scent on Barrbarr. Loaded my brush for around 20 seconds and had plenty for 3 full passes. Have a couple more blades to try a 2nd time but they're going to have to be good for me not to buy Voskhods in bulk.",

(I am becoming a synth fiber difference agnostic...) Loads and dispenses product superlatively well, great face feel with useful backbone and readily induced splay, plus solid construction that holds up over use and an aesthetically pleasing color and pattern on an ergonomic handle.\n* Soap: Back before WK added donkey milk, hops, buffalo whey, amino acids, adamantium, vibranium, etc to its tallow bases, this was \"patient zero\", offering tallow with triple butters, lanolin, and castor oil. It still holds up well in 2019, offering a great shave with quite good protection and post shave. The most recent iteration of the WK base, with all the fancy stuff, offers noticeably better post shave and protection, but the core of an excellent base can be seen in the earlier product.\n* Frag: One of the most versatile scents for men, Caron's blend of lavender, vanilla, and amber can be worn in most seasons and settings and can be found pretty cheaply at most times.",

I think I may have overloaded a tad so I had to keep adding water to stop it from drying out on my face within a few seconds. Post shave feels very good for not using my usual DG unscented liniment and opting for just witch hazel and DG's fantastic aftershave instead. Speaking of which, I just got this Mayflower in yesterday and I forgot how damn good this scent is. I love it. Now Scott needs to make an EdT of it. I doubt that will happen, but one can dream.",

I feel really spoiled by all the good gear. 2.5 days growth, the WR2 even at 0.85 is plenty efficient for me. First time using a voskhod in a long while and it felt really smooth despite feeling a lot more dull than my usual daily drivers: Polsilver SI or Perma-Sharp. Can't ever go wrong with a B6 knot, one of my absolute favs. Bufala is an incredible base and I really don't know if there's a better post shave out there. I feel like due to only being the seasonal scents everyone's really skipped over this or maybe I'm just late to the party but this stuff is legit. Combine that with DG aftershave and the WK balm and my face is incredibly soft and irritation free.\n\nGreat start to a Wednesday.",

The scent opens with a green neroli kind of citrus and has a well blended, hard to describe cologn-y scent in the background, a little musky to my nose as well. Off the puck it's a fairy light scent, and remains so when lathered. I got a better sense of the scent from the splash for sure.\n\nIt's my first go with the Buffala base, and it performed really well, it's the density and post shave of this lather that really stood out. That's a first impression, will need to spend a bit more time with it.\n\nThis brush, even though I've used it a lot, still has a little funk to it....will need to figure out how to rid it of that because it's becoming an annoyance to use it! Very dense with a good amount of scrubbiness (no scratchiness at all, the tips are quite soft).\n\nMan, I feel lucky to be able to shave with such good gear.\n\nHappy hump day folks!",

I used these before, but do not have any fond memories. This time was much different - I had a very nice shave. Not the sharpest feeling blade - but sharp enough, especially for my \"nice, cleaned up, hydrated and ready to go\" beard. I had a flawless 3 pass shave. I could see myself using Big Ben as my mid-sharp blade.\n\nI continue to be surprised by the quality of shaves I am getting from blades I considered 'bad' or 'not for me'. Technique throws away much of the YMMV in shaving - that is the realization I am reaching towards. I have come so far from my initial \"only Feather works for me\" stance.",

Gotta reap that sweet karma somehow.\n\n**Razor:** Bastard Tech\n\n**Blade:** Voskhod (2)\n\n**Brush:** Omega 80266\n\n**Lather:** SW Tres Matres\n\n**Post Shave:** Witch Hazel, Luck Tiger, and some lotion\n\nGlad I waited the extra day to shave and switched over to the tech. Still a bit of neck irritation that I was dealing with last week, but it seems to be clearing up and I had minimal burning from the WH so I'm guessing no new irritation on the neck. I did nick my upper lip a touch with my XTG pass, but nothing too major.\n\nFinally getting the hang of the Omega boar brush. Also, finding that I like palm lathering. I've mostly face lathered up to now and I kind of get it started in a mug that doubles as my brush holder when I'm mid shave. However, it seems like I can't get a good lather in the mug and if I start face lathering too early it's entirely too watery and I end up losing a bunch by moving to a vertical surface before it's whipped up enough.\n\nA couple of related quick notes -\n\n* The Bastard Tech is my combo of a NDC handle and top cap with a 1957 C baseplate. I picked up the C tech recently along with the 1954 Super Speed I've been trying out and the handle/top cap of the C razor are pretty corroded but the C baseplate holds a blade evenly than the NDC baseplate for some reason.\n\n* I'm really starting to like the Tres Matres scent. At first I was a bit meh on it, but the more I use it the more I like it. It makes me feel dirty in a good way. I was going to elaborate, but I think I'll leave it at that.",

WTG, XTG, and ATG clean up. Despite the slight irritation yesterday, today went well. Stirling soap definitely made the shave a bit slicker than the Omega Cream. As a result, I had a great shave with no irritation. Tiny bit of stubble left but that's okay for me.\n\n**The Soap** worked well. The scent was a bit feminine at first but now, it's enjoyable. It still has a feminine scent but I like it. The performance on this soap is probably the best out of all my Stirling's. This one is the latest one that I got and for some reason, it performs and lathers the best. Ones that I bought on the bazaar takes a bit longer to lather and does not produce as much lather as current formulation soaps. It might be due to the soap drying but anyhow, it's a great soap nonetheless.\n\n**The Razor and Blade** combination worked well. It was comfortable to use and I didn't feel much irritation during and after the shave. The blade cut pretty well but it was not perfect. I had a thought of the blade dulling but it doesn't seem to be that way. I'll continue to use for couple more times and depending on those shaves, I'll either switch out or continue.\n\n**The Brush** felt great. This was one of my first synthetic brushes and boy is it soft. It's soft with little backbone and makes a fantastic lather every time. It really should be my travel brush but I got a Omega mini brush instead. This synthetic performs well every time and I got nothing bad to say about it. Maybe the handle is a tiny bit small for my hands but it's still comfortable.\n\n**The aftershave portion** was great. A mild sensation with the Thayer's WH Rose and a great chilling sensation with the Ice cold balm. My face felt great after and the post shave moisturized the skin very well.\n\nOverall, a great shave. Everything went well and I have nothing to complain about. I had a tiny bit of stubble but I would have gotten irritation if I try to remove every single one of the hair. One thing that I learned was that the angle of the strokes are very important. No matter how many passes I do, if I do it at the wrong angle, the hairs will stay the same. I'm experimenting with the angles and I've been getting good results. Next shave will probably feature a soap I haven't used in a while and the Omega 10066.",

Plus it's a lovely scent and it performs great.\n\nI got 3 shaves out of my the Mühle blade I was using before this Polsilver. This is the first time I've gone beyond 6 shaves on a blade. Is this a fluke or my new normal? Time will tell I guess. I'm still getting very comfortable, close shaves with very little drama. It's definitely less sharp on the ATG pass but not to the point where it's having a significant impact.\n\nI hope you all have more flowers than showers wherever you are!\n\nEdit: Also I just put in sample orders from Maggards and Shavedash so I can participate in the Lather Games (as much as I can, being outside of CONUS / Canada!). I think I'll have something suitable for every day now, even if I dont hit all of the sponsors. It's a good excuse to enable my sample habit anyway!",

I like this scent a lot more in lather than I do off the sample. It's good off the sample, for sure but once it's lathered the complexity is really nice.",

I have smelled Sauvage, but it's been a while. At least according to my memory it's a very good approximation of the scent, which is your typical department store cologne but it's well done. It would definitely have popular appeal if you haven't smelled it. There is nothing offensive about it at all.\n\nOf course, wonderful performance with Icarus. And I should praise the aftershave too. It's excellent stuff and deserves more praise than it gets. It's definitely one of my favorite aftershave products.",

Summer Storm is a favorite and definitely fitting for the current monsoon season here. I always enjoy shaving with the Super Iridiums, but damn I wish they were closer in price to Astras. They are lil smoother than the Astras for me but the price difference keeps them from being a daily driver.",

Why this should be so is a mystery to me.\n* **Brush**: Lively butterscotch resin handle with good ergos and what is perhaps the Best Badger Bargain in the land of shaving. This fan is about two years old and still looks brand new - has not lost a single hair and offers efficient flow through of soap to lather.\n* **Soap**: thematic perfection to an extent - lots of floral presence, but dark and complex rather than light and airy. But certainly pretty flowers in abundance...\n* **Frag**: Speaking of gloomy spring scents, here's a classic! Grassy and bright, yet pungent and brooding at the same time.",

First shave went quite well. The razor is both smooth and efficient, as advertised.\n\nFor today's theme, I decided to recreate April showers with my recently acquired tub of BaM Petrichor paired with CFG's Summer Storm splash. The May flowers (since I don't own Mayflower soap/splash and scoot hasn't released a Mayflower EdT) came from BaM JRfaT EdP.\n\nToday is the packing day at work. They're moving my team (all the tech and non-tech teams that roll up to my Directory) across the street. We have to be packed and away from our desks by noon today. I'm 99% packed and I intend to stay at my desk until the movers show up to cart it away because I've got shit to do today.",

      "body": "Prep: Washing myself of yesterday in a warm shower\n\nLather: PantaRei Gattopardo\n\nBrush: Morris & Forndran 3XL Blonde Lime w/Cobalt belt\n\nRazor: REX Ambassador 5 / 4 / 2.5\n\nBlade: Wizamet Iridium Super Extra Stainless (4)\n\nPost: PantaRei Gattopardo Afyershave Splash\n\nFirst go with a PantaRei soap. This is a Limited Edition soap that comes in a hand made and hand painted coffrett. The art is absolutely gorgeous! It's a lion with script text hand painted on the side displaying 'PantaRei Gattopardo' and 'Sapone di Barbs'. Stunning to say the least!\nI'll say I bought the soap with expectations of the soap itself being Tcheung Fung Sing soap in the coffrett, but I was wrong! This soap is custom made for PantaRei from a French soap maker, with the box displaying \"Made exclusively for PantaRei Brushes di Alessandro Pistoia by Laboratories Lelegard ..... France'\nThe scent pyramid is as follows:\n\nBamboo, Blackberry (fruit)\n\nLeather, Pine, Cinnamon\n\nCypress, Sandalwood, Benzoin\n\nThe blackberry comes strong out of the jar, with a faint pine in the distant background. To me, the pine was along the lines of the fir in B&Ms 'First Snow', a very dry scent. This along with the blackberry smell fantastic! The soap opens up a good bit after lathering, where the leather and bamboo come out a good bit more. When shaving everything comes together nicely as a nice woody, herbal, blackberry scent. I REALLY like the scent!!! In fact, if there was a matching frag I'd be all over it. Very nice!\nThe shave itself was great! This is a fairly thirsty soap, and took a bit for me to dial it in. I started with a wet brush and started in. I was a little worried as it started a bit foamy, but turned to a nice shiny, thick lather after some time and enough water.\nOverall, I am VERY pleased with this purchase!!!\n\nFor the razor, I went with a new number arrangement. Starting with 5, and dialing down for each subsequent pass once again for a fantastic shave. Hell yeah!!!\n\nDFS with a new soap that I'm really excited about! Doesn't get any better!!!\n\nHappy Thursday fellow wet shavers!!!\n\nEdited to add soap ingredient list:\n\nPotassium Stéarate, PotassiumCocoate, Aqua, CoconutFaty Acid, Glycérine, Buturospwrum Parkii Buter, parfum, Limonene, Cinnamal",

This was my first chance to use the Mood Indigo EdP since I was traveling the first half of the week. Smells fantastic. The EdP isn't super strong, but the longevity has been good. That's probably just right since you don't necessarily want too much projection on a boozy scent like this. Might concern some of your coworkers. But, 8 hours later I can still smell it well on me which is awesome.",

Being the Thursday prior to the Kentucky Derby makes it \"Thurby\" here in the 'ville - meaning lots of events every day this week leading up to [the most exciting 2 minutes in sports for 2019](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky_Derby) - and traffic is expected to blow in the city, so I'm glad I'm teleworking today. Still, with the weather going from hot and humid to wet and windy at the drop of a hat, the day just feels weird.\n\n\nTime to turn the beat around with an underappreciated soap from Noble Otter, Flying Hide.\n\n\nI had picked this up in a lot sale, and it had piqued my interest. However, it smelled very different from Sherlock and Roam (my other leather scents), so I didn't give it another thought. My oh my, that was a mistake. Having looked at it again when I rotated my software for the season, the lathered scent captured my attention - enough to make me sad that this scent is being discontinued.\n\nAfter applying some Declaration Liniment after the aftershave splash, I put on some [Azzaro Club](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Azzaro/Azzaro-Club-Men-21986.html) - an interesting and discontinued fragrance for men (plus a women's version) that was available from 2013 to 2015 as far as I know. To my nose, this smells like a soapy/barbershoppy accord that's related to original Polo Green fragrance and would match perfectly with Pinaud Clubman, and it wears on my skin very nicely according to Mrs. Caber. My decant is running low, so if anyone has a bottle they would be willing to part with, please let me know!\n\nHappy Thurby to all, and [too bad about Omaha Beach](http://www.espn.com/horse-racing/story/_/id/26650273/derby-favorite-omaha-beach-scratched-race).

I was stoked to try my Cryogen/ WK Fouger Bouquet super lather but I checked the SOTD thread before getting out of bed and WHAM! There it was. u/ Old_Hiker had already posted up that he'd used this as his SOTD as well as at least one other member. Because I wasn't showering this morning it was a little of a pain to bloom the soap but I set it up before heading down to make my coffee. I dumped the bloom water in my bowl and was worried it was too much for the load but I just kept working the lather and it just kept getting better. The scent hit me with honeysuckle first before moving on to the other floral note. The scent is medium strong in my opinion but not overpowering and its stayed with me all day. The magnolia actually reads as more gardenia to my nose but its been awhile since I've smelled a magnolia flower. I think its well done and the only post shave I used today was the DG matching splash. The dose of menthol was tremendous this morning. I'm suspicious this scent is going to grow on me like GLS and WK MOT did. We'll see. I'm already kinda looking ahead to Southern Paradise though. :-)",

I honestly thought I was working on Friday and I feel terrible about dropping the ball. I shaved in a rush this morning and grabbed what was close at hand that I thought I could make work. This is the first time I have truly done a quick shave without my usual ritual and I'm surprised I diden't Karve up my face. I hate that I diden't give my brush the attention it deserves. The shave itself was nice but I don't remember Seville having that sharp citrus. I remember lemon tones, but after trying YRP, it feels closer to that then it does Sweet Lemon.\n\n​\n\nI completed a graphic design project last night and send off the copy for review. It feels nice to have one project complete so I can focus on the next. Speaking of projects, I am going to be headed to Maggards at the end of this month and I am looking forward to meeting some of you.\n\n​\n\nY'all have a great day,\n\nRobot",

I have several large projects on the table that are taking up the majority of my time. Two of the three projects are nearing completion but while I have deadlines, I have been choosing to focus on my commitments to others rather than my own photography.\n\n​\n\nI choose to break into a set I have sitting on my shelf, unused, Stirling \"Kaboom\". Based on the popular mens scent \"Spicebomb\", Kaboom was a soap I wasn't too drawn too as I felt it was a bit youthful for me. That said, the soap was lovely and I even went back and used the AS for a second time later that day for a refresh.\n\n​\n\nScents like Spicebomb make me question my take on youthful vs. mature scents. I tend to lean more towards scents like Green Irish Tweed as opposed to Aventus. Something a little older and more mature for a daily wear. That said, I think there's still times that I can reach for something like Spicebomb and make it work. I don't think its workplace appropriate and more of a weekend and night scent, but it still smells good.\n\n​\n\nHave a good Wednesday y'all,\n\nRobot",

I know they have changed the packaging recently and that's great, when I apply slight pressure to my brush it basically fills up the whole tub so there's no room for swirling.\n\nThe Soap Commander performs well in the summer months, its a much thinner balm than my WK or Chatillon Lux but goes on easily and leaves a good feel.\n\nI don't often wear fragrances when I've shaved but my Imaginary Authors sample set arrived yesterday so I'm just working my way through them to find one that I like. Didn't try to pair anything today but picked the next one. I can't work out if I like this or not, its a kind of spicey leather, its nice enough but I'm going to have to see how it progresses over the next few hours.",

I've learned over time with this one that I can't add too much water to it, because even with a dripping wet brush, it still produces fluffy and satisfyingly thick lather with enough brushwork. The aftershave and the soap both have a richer wood-powder-spice scent than the current Old Spice aftershave, for which I'm grateful. The post shave feel from the B&M is still my favorite, with the Reserve line only bested by Excelsior.",

WK is still my best lather, so MLS had a high bar to compete against. Got a good slick lather quickly and post shave was top notch. The Nacet blade is still going strong and comfortable, so no worries there. I got very little feedback from the splash, so we're calling this a 2-pass DFS.\n\nScent: The Tempest scent was almost gone by the time I rinsed and went to apply the splash. Yesterday with the Réunion soap, the scent hung around for quite a while into the morning.\n\nThe Réunion splash scent is good and strong, but not overpowering. I do wish the Tempest scent hung around for longer. It would be a great scent combo for a splash (there may be something like this already out there). Maybe down the road, I'll scoop a small bit out of each tub and see how they mix.\n\nTL:DR - Shave wise, I like the Tempest lather with the Réunion AS. Scent wise, I like the Réunion lather with the Tempest AS.\n\nHappy Friday!",

Patchy fog before 1pm. Otherwise, cloudy, with a high near 47. Southeast wind 5 to 10 mph. Chance of precipitation is 60%. New precipitation amounts of less than a tenth of an inch possible. High tide at 11:24 tonight.\n\nAfter using the Charcoal Goods for a couple of head shaves and going back to the Schick I find myself still preferring the Schick. While the Charcoal Goods could reliably pinch hit the Schick remains top ranked for head-shave razors.\n\nLooking at the soap I think I have 3, maybe 4, shaves left in this tub. Can't wait for it to be gone. This brush is starting to smell like the soap even on off days. After this tub is done I will be doing a run through with Dec Brush Rejuvenator and setting it aside for a while. The next kill soap is a toss up between two, so will have to make that decision in the next week or so.\n\nHave a nice Friday everyone!",

The screening was part of the Tribeca Film Festival, and the theater adjacent to the World Trade Center site. We were deep in conversation and I didn't notice where we were until we were there, standing at the edge of one of the memorial pools that cover the entire footprint of the two towers that fell in the 9/11 attacks. The polished black stone edge of the pools is engraved with names, and instead of towers stretching into the sky, water rushes down into bottomless blackness. It was my first visit to the site since before the attacks. It's at once beautiful and terrible, and I was overwhelmed.\n\n\nJust a few days later this set arrived, graciously sent by new soap artisan Michael Riley. I thought about what it meant to be a first responder, and about the families left behind when these brave men and women give their lives in service to others.\n\n\nThe shave was excellent. Super easy to dial in, dense, shiny, and slick. The scent is a CK Eternity for men dupe, which should appeal to many as it's a nice straightforward cologne scent. The splash bottle has an interesting gradient print that matches the label artwork well, and the splash itself is a cloudy white color.\n\n\nFirst Line's debut release is today, and I have no doubt it will sell out quickly. Not only will some folks be adding a nice new soap to the den, Officer Riley will be donating a portion of proceeds to a St. Louis charity called BackStoppers. From their website:\n\n\n\"The BackStoppers recognizes the tremendous sacrifices that these public servants make every day when they go to work. We understand the burdens placed on surviving spouses and children when tragedies occur. We believe our community has an obligation to care for the loved ones of those who have protected us. We accept the responsibility to make that happen.\"",

This was one of my favorite blades the first time through my sampler but I'd have to put it behind Voskhod & GSB after trying it again. We'll see how the next couple of shaves go before I give the Polisilver another go, it was my #1 initially. Got a DFS nonetheless WTG XTG XTG.\n\nThe soap and AS might be my favorite. I like the scent on Seville slightly better but the post shave feel of this is amazing. I may need to try adding MOAR water next time I use BaM to give it a fair shake.",

First experience with stringy shave soap, first time seeing elmers glue consistency on a shave soap, and first time having an amazing skin feel throughout the shave.\n\nThe pre-shave butter is very good (paging /u/ragingpenguin) Quite oily, as was known before, but was easy to work into the skin. My skin remained slick/oily until a couple passes in. My skin didn't feel oily after the shave. Having not prep'd with a hot shower, I found this pre-shave helped a lot. However, I'd have to try it with a previously known soap to confirm that.\n\nThe bison tallow base is incredible. I did not feel the blade on my skin and the Nacet just seemed to cut through. I was taken aback by how weird the soap was when loading but I kept working it in. The resulting lather is very luxurious and thick. I can't say I've had a shave quite like it. That being said, I wish I had looked up what to keep in mind before lathering - the soap is on the softer side (even though it looks like the Icarus base) and loads quite quickly. I would probably take it easier next time or use a synthetic brush for lathering. I absolutely love the scent on this DG soap (similar to terre d'Hermes) and I still get whiffs of it a few hours later.\n\nThe Maol grooming AS is excellent. IMO, the scent complements the soap well. The performance is really good - nice amount of methanol and the cooling feel didn't last very long but it also doesn't require a lot of product. Goes on easy too.\n\nI can go on but I'll stop - I have zero regrets about the new products I tried today. It's just good stuff and several hours later, my face still feels awesome.\n\nFridays before a vacation week are the best! Have a good one folks!",

I know I sound like a poster person for The somewhat controversial PAA, but I have a few of their razors and really enjoy them. I almost think they should quit with soaps and focus on higher quality razor production. But, who am I to say. Always do what you feel! The idea of reproducing some of these old models is neat in my opinion. The Ecliptic has been intriguing for me. It produces a close, comfortable shave if I can take my time, but, if I get the angle wrong, it will bite! I feel it is a real technique builder as my other razors do not make me be this precise. Hope everyone is having a great day and great shaves!",

Face lathered with the Stirling and got lovely performance as usual, then got an amazing 2-pass BBS shave out of the EJ and the Lord Platinum. Very smooth and zero irritation. Honestly a much nicer shave than I anticipated.\n\nStirling Noir soap is sort of green and cologney. The aftershave has a little lemon opening, a short green heart, and a woody patchouli drydown that's more lumber than fir needles. Drakkar Noir, by comparison, has much more lemon zest, complex greenery, and more leather and Christmas fir tree scent in its drydown. All three are a bit different but they all compliment each other nicely.\n\nNormally I wouldn't wear any fragrance on a work trip because of the close quarters in the car, but we're spending most of today wandering around the construction sites. I can afford to smell fancy while I'm dealing with contractors.",

Really pumped to try it out. So I picked a superb base to make sure it all went well. Also testing Sellout a second time to see if it was too weak for my tastes.\n\n#### ❧ Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Gillette - Sheraton 1938 ::: Gillette - Nacet ‹149 uses›)*\n\nGreat shave today. Close and comfy. Tomorrow a big milestone.\n\n#### ❧ Soap Notes\n*^(Declaration Grooming Icarus - Sellout)*\n\nIcarus is great as usual. I like Bison maybe a little better, but this is excellent.\n\nScent is very nice version of Aventus\n\nStrength is 3-4/10 and was lightly present during shave. Any lighter and I may have had to pass it on to someone else.\n\n40 sec load with lightly wet badger + 3.25 tsp water = gave me just the right amount of soap for 4-5 passes and it was the perfect consistency for me: slick, but creamy.\n\nBowl - I used the XL version of this bowl:\nhttps://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3392930\n\n#### ❧ Brush Notes\n*^(Stirling - Finest in CravingShaving Blue Slate 26mm‹2 uses›)*\n\nsecond time using this knot, but new in this handle.\n\nI found this handle online at Craving Shaving and ordered it with no knot. I had a Stirling Finest knot that I wanted to put into it. I had finally found a handle at a reasonable price that looked like it would be nice to hold AND would fit the 26mm Stirling knot.\n\nI had used the Stirling knot once in its original handle and it was so hard to work/use that I put it down for a couple of months and didn't use it again. The Fan shaped Stirling badgers seem to have better handles (at least for me), but I like the bulb/hybrid better. So my super-soft knot sat around not getting any love.\n\nI didn't want to just pass the brush on to someone else, because it's an amazing value. And a brush that I think is a great recommendation for new-to-badger users. So I decided to re-home it. The CS handle came in recently and I quickly took it to the garage and chiseled off the Stirling handle from the knot, with some Dremel work to polish it off. Then I glued the knot into the new handle with silicone. It was so hard to wait the 2 days for it to cure. I was very anxious.\n\nSecond use o f the knot proved just as good as the first. Such soft tips and decent backbone, though I do hope the latter relaxes a little. I believe it will. I was very pleased with it and the new handle worked out so well.\n\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Cut flush to where I just see the tips (above average for me)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm)\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

I really like Waves and can't wait for the EdC for this and Fern, as I've mentioned previously. That will mean EdCs for my top 4 Reserve scents. If Classic and Spice ever have EdCs I'm sure I'll set aside some cash just to have the Reserve sets in full, but those two are far and away my least used compared to the other 4.

Didn't really notice the drag people say it has. Took a bit getting used to the heft of it. I could see myself picking up a aluminum version. Great razor.",

That kinda vanished after the second shave - this time I didn't shower before the shave, so my beard wasn't as soft as it could be. I clearly noticed the increased tugging/friction. It was almost uncomfortable especially during XTG and ATG passes.\n\nSo, for my third shave, I had a shower as a pre-shave again. I noticed less friction than the second shave, but I wasn't as happy as I was with my first shave. You can say that my experience was a good one but not a great one if this was the only blade I had, I would be satisfied, I would probably shower before every shave. But this isn't a blade I will look forward to using a lot.",

It's got a very tar scented top with botanicals in the mid and base. Wasn't really my cup of tea.\n\n​\n\nI go to load the brush and this stuff loads so easily. Especially compared to the several other grooming department soaps I've tried in the past. The website describes it this way: \"This base is an homage to the classic Italian soaps. A tallow only base, with large amounts of cupuacu butter and coconut oil. My objective for this base is to create a soap with a high degree of cushion. This base is visibly denser than all my other soaps and can handle an extraordinary amount of water. This base contains the least number of ingredients compared to my other formulas.\"\n\n​\n\nIt absolutely accomplishes what it set out to. This base is now in my top tier (for sure) alongside B&M Excelsior, and the latest A&E base. I am absolutely stunned at the performance, and the post shave feel is noticeable (similar to A&E and WK Bufala).\n\n​\n\nAlthough the scent isn't my favorite, I am amped to use this soap more in the rotation. Perhaps a Lather Games appearance for it too.",

I want to go back a second time and really focus on the soap, scent and overall performance.\n\nReleased as a one time offering in 2018 on Black Friday by stirling, Kaboom has a bit of a story to it. during production, it was discovered that Noble Otter already had a limited edition soap and aftershave called Kaboom in being released with the same scent profile.\n\nWhile some companies may bicker about who had the idea first or copyright of name, Stirling and Noble Otter came to a really good resolution with Stirling sending $1 for each shave jar and aftershave splash to Noble Otter. Noble Otter then donated the money to The Ocean Cleanup Foundation. For those not familiar Kaboom is a duplicate scent of Spicebomb by Viktor & Rolf. The scent is warm, sweet and a little spicy. Fragrance Net provides the following notes: amber, bergamot, grapefruit, chili , and tobacco.\n\nI myself am somewhat torn. This is a great scent but I worry if it is \"age appropriate\". This feels like something to wear going out for the night when I was in my 20's. I would place it along side Aventus as a power scent if you will. As I near my forties, I find myself draw to fragrances like Green Island Tweed or Grey Velvetier. This is not a slight against the fragrance, just a personal observation.\n\nThe soap has an excellent performance for its price point. Stirling knows their customer base. They provide a good product at an exceptional price. I would argue they are the great value of the wetshaving world and I frequently recommend them to anyone looking to dip their toe into our hobby.\n\nCurrently Stirling Kaboom is out of production. Soaps with similar scents include Noble Otter Kaboom, Oleo Wayoh or A&E Revolution.\n\nHave a great Friday!\n\nRobot",

I put THE SMALLEST little scoop in my bowl and it was terrific, but almost on the verge of too much. Its amazing how powerful this stuff is. It was a very refreshing shave. The star of the show was the Fougere Gothique however. I fully expected to hate this based on how polarizing this scent is apparently but instead I love it. I put one spray from the sample on fully expecting to smell burning human flesh or something. Instead there was a very real earthy note like stepping on a rotting log with beetles inside, a sharp but pleasant note. Then a nice woody note came out along with the rest of the more typical fouger accord. I already put a WTTF up on DFS. I'm sure it will go nowhere. I really hope Will brings this scent back this fall. I'm crossing my fingers that I like Beaudelaire this much as well because I traded for a set that should be arriving tonight. If its 90% of FG I'm going to be a very happy guy.",

WTG, XTG, and ATG clean up. This was one of my least favorite soaps but I somehow made it work today. The razor and blade combo was excellent and I enjoyed going back to my original Omega brush. Pleasant post shave setup.\n\n**The Soap** worked decently. This is one of those soaps that I could not lather for my life. But I realized that I have to start with a wet brush without even shaking a single bit. Plenty of water from the start and I loaded the soap like I was mad. A good 45 seconds of loading and the soap actually turns out pretty slick and creamy. It does not have good structure and although it is a bit airy, it does its job. I like the strong scent and I might use this once in a while. It's my go to soap for cleaning/breaking in brushes so it's gotten a lot of hand lathering uses.\n\n**The Razor and Blade** combination worked well. Even though the razor was OC, it was a medium aggressive setup. Shaved similar to EJ89 and I loved the feel across my face. Close shave at the end and I did not get a single irritation. Only irritation was a slight burning sensation from the soap but other than that, everything else was fine. Great razor and blade combo that I can use any time of the day.\n\n**The Brush** felt great. This was my first boar brush and I got it because of Nick Shaves. I remember him saying that this is a great budget boar brush and it really is. It lathers well and gives a good scrub to the face. I always think of this brush as a tiny one but when I use it, it blooms quite well. I had plenty of lather to work with and this is great for both budget and veteran setups.\n\n**The aftershave portion** was great. I wanted the mild touch with the Thayer's because the soap had a slight burning sensation. To end with the chill, ice cold balm did its magic. Great post shave feel.\n\nOverall, a great shave. The soap worked decently and I can shave with it if I have to. However, it does cause a slight burning sensation so I can't let the lather stay on my face for too long. It might be the Bay Rum or the bentonite clay. Anyhow, great shave today and everything worked out nicely. Can't wait for more shaves.",

How about that? Whodathunkit? Good comfy shave. And returned back to Glissant after a long hiatus of trying new stuff and samples. Diamond is the cats pajamas.\n\n#### ❧ Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Gillette - Sheraton 1938 ::: Gillette - Nacet ‹150 uses›)*\n\nI don't think this blade feels any different than it did at 100! Good shave. Decided to do 4 passes with less buffing, just to get more of that Diamond on me!\n\nI'll take a bit of a hiatus now, to use other razors and blades before I get back on the Nacet train.\n\n#### ❧ Soap Notes\n*^(Barrister and Mann - Diamond)*\n\nScent: I love all the scents Will put into this one.\n\nScent Strength: 4-5/10, nicely present during shaving.\n\nGlissant is a great lather. I think I like it better than Excelsior. So slick and creamy.\n\n30 second load with lightly-wet, dense, badger brush + 5 tsp water = 5 passes of lather.\n\nBowl - I used the XL version of this bowl:\nhttps://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3392930\n\n#### ❧ Brush Notes\n*^(Declaration Grooming - B5 Carnavis and Richardson Rubberset 400 24mm‹4 uses›)*\n\nSoft but with a little backbone. Enjoyable.\n\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Cut flush to where I just see the tips (above average for me)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm)\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

The performance is great and the scent is nice too. I am bald and shave my head in the shower. I have begun using these soaps on my head and the performance is noticeably better. I do not use the Merkur on my head. I'm not good enough for that! That said I really like this scent. It's a clean, classic barbershop scent but it's not particularly strong, which is fine with me.\n\nThe blue label Proraso balm is great for my skin. I have sensitive skin on my neck and this product really helps so much after the shave. It's also nice on my freshly shaved head. Clean, light scent. Absorbs nicely with no greasy feeling. Good stuff!\n\nFirst time wearing GIT (sample) so we'll see how it goes. Going to go with a light application for starters.",

Mostly cloudy, with a high near 58. North wind around 5 mph becoming southeast in the afternoon. High tide at 11:50 this morning.\n\nI doubt he'll see this, but wishing /u/mpontiff and his fiancee/wife the best on their day of nuptials.\n\n**Soap/Scent:** After yesterday's scare that I had missed the Try This Soap 2018 I decided to pull the original version out this morning. This is my favorite scent, hands down. It's one that fits anytime of year, for any mood that I have. My one regret is that I didn't pick up a back up, but with all of the new releases coming out weekly it seems I should be able to find something to replace it once I do use it up.\n\n**Razor(s):** This shavette comes to me via /u/Ugmug. A few weeks ago he had asked for advice on a shavette in the Daily Quesitons thread. /u/NeedsMoreMenthol came in with his encyclopedia of knowledge with a few recommendations, and I had made a comment about wanting to try one, but not being high on the list of shave priorities. Ugmug bought this one and tried it, but the length of shaves meant it just couldn't happen. He contacted me and offered to PIF it asking if I didn't like it that I PIF it. I got it in Thursday evening. Friday being a head shave day I put it aside until this morning.\n\nI attempted one full face pass. I say attempted because I was unable to figure out the correct angle of attack/grip to get under my nose. I also apparently **had** some sort of blemish on my cheek. Luckily it wasn't that big, and the styptic pencil was enough to stem the flow. It will definitely take some getting used to, but as of right now I prefer it to the straight razor that I have just collecting dust. Just did one pass with the shavette, did a clean up with the Charcoal Goods razor. Over all a rather enjoyable experience.\n\nHave a nice Saturday everyone!",

I smelled this at Pasteurs a few weeks ago, and I liked it. It's a citrusy aquatic scent. I dislike the sharpness of most aquatic scents, and this one didn't have that. Superb shave today with this very easy to use, slick base. Really enjoyed Florian and am glad I picked it up. Happy Saturday and happy Kentucky Derby to race fans.",

My technique had some room for improvement, but I got a great BBS shave (at least on my cheeks). I don't have the confidence yet to go ATG on my neck. That'll come with time and practice.\n\nThis scent is amazing. Very savory and deep. A good opposite to my other spring/summer citrusy scents.\n\nOverall, this was a very peaceful and relaxing shave.\n\nHappy Saturday!",

I've given a great deal of thought to several categories. Including desert island shave and most expensive set up. I wonder how true we can be as competitors to pick a soap as your 'favorite soap that you would take with you to live on an island\" while also adhering to 30 different soap brands in 30 days for the bonus point. It's all subjective I suppose.\n\nToday I'm shaving with Phillips Fougere. This is a light, bright Fougere with a bit of citrus and green notes. It's clean and refreshing. The scent notes from trythatsoap make no reference to citrus (Grass, Fir, Oakmoss, Lavender, Coumarin) , but I still get a faint bit of bergamot or lemon. The aftershave has some menthol and witch hazel for a nice post shave cooling. It's a bit simplistic as far as a Fougere goes, but it aligns with my preference for cleaner Fougeres as opposed to dark, dirty fougeres in the realm of Beaudelaire.\n\nThe soap itself is medium-soft and is vegan, built around a coconut and shea butter base. I have shaved with this soap extensively and have no problems building a very rich lather. My chief complaint with this soap is the packaging. The jar is not your standard 4in round, but something smaller and this makes it hard to load a 26-28mm brush.\n\nI shaved with my borrowed Aristocrat this morning and its It's lovely. I have a box full of razors that someone in the community loaned me and despite having another eight razors to try, I keep coming back to the Aristocrats. They give an incredibly close shave while also remaining very mild. I finished off the shave with some 2010 Houbigant Fougere Royale. Supposedly Barrister and Mann \"Fern\" is based on the fragrance. Initially off the spray it's got a bit of Bergamot and Lavender and then after the drydown it fades to green notes, rose, amber and a bit of patchouli. It smells clean, classy and timeless. I find myself wanting to track down some of the 1882 blend that inspired the Australian Private Reserve \"Fougere Trois\".\n\nIn other news, I am getting ready to take my family on vacation. We will be spending a week in Southern California, visiting Disneyland, San Diego Zoo and some museums. My daughter is hugely into dinosaurs and geology right now and we are planning to visit the San Diego Natural History Museum.\n\nHave a good Saturday y'all!\n\nRobot",

I prefer that of the soap to the AS, though, so I don't pair them too frequently. Curious to sample the EdT if/when that comes out.",

For some folks, today is only important because it happens to be May the fourth, so happy Star Wars Day, nerds. For those of us with more than an ounce of culture, the first Saturday in May is Derby Day. For the 145th time, 3-year old thoroughbreds will run a mile and a quarter beneath the twin spires of Churchill Downs in Louisville, KY, competing for that blanket of roses and the first jewel in the triple crown.\n\nMy first piece of Derby advice is to skip the mint julep. They taste like sweet garbage water. You want to drink bourbon on Derby Day? Drink it neat or maybe on the rocks, but good bourbon doesn't need sugar syrup and mint. If you want a Derby cocktail, try the [Lily](https://www.kentuckyderby.com/party/recipes/drinks/finlandia-oaks-lily) - the official drink of the Kentucky Oaks (a race for fillies that was run yesterday).\n\nMy second piece of Derby advice is to go back in time to yesterday and bake yourself a pie. There's this certain kind of pie that often gets served on the first Saturday in May back home in Kentucky. People have many different names for this pie (mostly because the most common name has been trademarked and the owners aren't afraid to sue). On page 160 of my Taste of Maysville cookbook, it's called Delicious Pie. When they first published the cookbook, they used the common name and then they got a nasty letter from a lawyer. They had to go back through all the copies of the cookbook and paste little corrections in to cover up the references to De*** Pie with Delicious Pie to avoid a lawsuit. For the sake of this subreddit, we'll just call it DE Pie:\n\n* 2 eggs, slightly beaten\n* 1 c sugar\n* 1/4 c all-purpose flour\n* 1/4 c butter or margarine, melted and cooled\n* 1/2 c chopped English walnuts\n* 1/2 c chopped black walnuts\n* 1 6 oz pkg or 1 c chocolate chips\n* 1 tsp vanilla extract\n* 1 unbaked 9\" pie shell\n\nCombine first 8 ingredients in a medium mixing bowl. Mix well. Pour filling into pie shell. Bake at 350 for 45 minutes or until pie shell is set. Nancy Fisher uses 1 cup English walnuts instead of the black walnuts. Yields: 6-8 servings\n\nHappy Derby Day, y'all! I'm picking the #4 horse Gray Magician at 31-1. Go, baby, go!",

Preshave - Unscented\n**Brush:** Stirling 2-Band Synthetic\n**Razor:** Muhle R41\n**Blade:** Gillette Nacet (1)\n**Lather:** [Barrister and Mann - Reserve Lavender - Soap](https://trythatsoap.com/collection/820/?product_type=soap)\n**Post Shave:** [Barrister and Mann - Reserve Lavender - Aftershave](https://trythatsoap.com/collection/820/?product_type=aftershave)\n\n\nThe West Coast Shaving Sale on the Muhle R41 got me to finally try this razor that I've been curious about for some time.\n\nI've heard a lot about how this is the most aggressive widely available razor, so aggressive that a lot of people wouldn't consider it for daily use. So, I figured I would wait to shave until it was delivered on Saturday. That way, if it mauls my face, I've got a day of recovery time before I need to go back to work.\n\nSo, with great trepidation, I loaded up a new Nacet blade, whipped up some B & M Reserve lather, and began. First stroke was on my cheek, and I could definitely feel more blade than in my normal razors. I made sure to use virtually no pressure.\n\nAnd it was great. No nicks or weepers after WTG or ATG. During my last pass, I got a pretty good gash right on my Adam's apple. I noticed one other tiny weeper under my chin, but that was really small.\n\nThe razor did leave my face the smoothest it may ever have been.\n\nI need to be more mindful on my neck, and I may only go ATG in parts of it, but the initial results from this razor were very encouraging.\n\nAlso, I just checked WCS to make sure the sale was still going on, and it's about $1.50 cheaper now than the $35 I paid for the razor. If you have been curious about the R41, now would be a good time to check it out. I don't think the price is going to get any lower than it is now.",

I picked up a second blade - the same result - it felt like they aren't adequately sharp. This was back in early 2015. The second time was when I started watching some YT videos in 2016 - I saw people raving about these so used one again. Almost the same result - so I chalked them up as 'not sharp enough for my tough coarse beard'.\n\nNow that my technique is far far superior, I know better, I use straight razors which probably aren't as 'sharp' as my favourite DE blades, I am revisiting some of those 'sus' blades. This shave went well, very good actually. Yes, these aren't the sharpest feeling blade - they aren't Feathers. But they are plenty sharp for me (I am willing to bet for any member of my species) with decent prep and good technique. Looking forward to my second shave - after which I will have a better idea. But I definitely not throwing away the rest of the Astra SP I have. Happy weekend, folks.",

I was a bit hesitant since I've never used something with blade gap this large, and I have sensitive skin. Hands down the most efficient shave I've had, and no irritation.\n\n\nFirst time using this soap as well. Lathering was going good until I broke it with too much water, RIP. Got it going again, but did have a hard time balancing how much water to add. Scent wise, it's pretty light. Haven't had any issues with my Noble Otter or Sterling soaps. Anyone else that has used Fine soaps have any tips? It's possible my brush was too wet. The AS initially smelled like chives to me, but that faded to Lavender and Mint within 10 seconds. Has a nice cooling effect that faded after a couple of minutes.",

WTG, XTG, and ATG clean up. Pretty clean shave today but I had to rush through it. I really do not enjoy morning shaves but I have to do it. Night shaves leave me a bit dirty in the morning with a bit o stubbles. I had a weeper or two but nothing serious.\n\n**The Soap** worked well. But that scent though. I really can't get used to the scent. It's a sweet, gourmandy kind of smell. It's similar to a oatmeal cookie but it's a little weird to me. It's like a cookie fragrance which I can't really enjoy. It's not like Arko where it gives me a headache but it's still too sweet and gourmand for me. I wanted to give it another try and it turns out that I can't use it. It performed well and gave me a good shave so that's a positive. I'm thinking of selling this on bazaar along with couple other items.\n\n**The Razor and Blade** combination worked well. Even with the OC, the razor was comfortable and the blade cut well. I did get a weeper or two but nothing serious. The blade might be at the end of its life but the next shaves will tell. Lovely setup and I can't wait to use these ones again in the near future.\n\n**The Brush** felt great. It has enough backbone and enough scritch to exfoliate the skin. It lathered up a lot and I had enough passes to last the entire shave. I do enjoy the 2-band badger as well as the silvertip. I was leaning towards the 2-band at first but I'm not so sure now. They both have their strengths and I enjoy both of them for what they are.\n\n**The aftershave portion** was great. I always had the Skin Bracer but I did not use it after getting extreme dry skin. However, I brought it back now that my face is doing a lot better. It felt great on the skin, especially with the menthol. Smells great and left me feeling amazing. I'll continue to use that and switch it with Thayer's once in a while.\n\nOverall, a great shave. Only thing to complain is the soap scent but there's not much that I can do about it. It's just not for me so I'll leave it at that. Everything else was comfortable and efficient. As for the next shave, I'm thinking of using the Citrus soap from Siliski with a boar brush and a mild razor.",

This is a great open comb, for anyone who might be afraid that they're too aggressive. Great, smooth, comfortable cutter. The head and blade worked so well together. The cut was so close that veterans might also love it.\n\nI'm looking forward to trying the B OC tomorrow, as well as contrasting these heads with their solid bar brethren.\n\nNo tugging or irritation.\n\n#### ❧ Soap Notes\n*^(Stirling - Mountain Man)*\n\nScent: One of my favorites! Like Silver Mountain cologne, from Creed.\n\nScent Strength: 4-5/10, lightly present during shaving.\n\nThis one was a bit on the wet side of perfect. Still worked super well, providing great glide for the razor and protection.\n\n40 second load with lightly-wet, soft boar brush + 3 1/3 tsp water = 4 passes of lather.\n\nMight try loading for 50 seconds next time, if I have a similar brush.\n\nBowl - I used the XL version of this bowl:\nhttps://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3392930\n\n#### ❧ Brush Notes\n*^(Semogue - 1305 Boar‹13 uses›)*\n\nSoft guy with mid-low backbone.

This stuff is good, real good. I went so far as to buy the matching pomade from Brew City Grooming too (which is kind of ironic since I'm balding...but what hair I have left looks good). Top notch performance from both the new Excelsior and Deltus base/formula and my next to last night shift started off strong. The day shift guy is a frag head and he was very complimentary of the scent too.\n\nOn a side note, I blind bought the new DG Taxes set this morning. Did I mess up? I've never smelled Sauvage, but I was in a spendy mood, so I pulled the trigger. We shall see.\n\nOne more night to go.",

It's time to do that, so first and worst: Alchemist.\n\nEverything about Alchemist's description sounds fantastic to me. Top notes of bergamot, greenery (rose stems, ivy leaves, and hyacinth); heart notes of mushroom, birch tar, and plumeria; and base notes of sandalwod, myrrh, amber, leather, and smoke. That sounds like a tent-camping trip in the woods! Unfortunately when I use it I am only reminded of the gross parts of camping. The opening notes remind me of campground washroom cleaning supplies & whatever product they use to hide the stench of septic tanks, and the drydown brings to mind old, dirty, smoke-saturated tents. I'm not a fan.\n\nActual shaving performance was very good. Southern Witchcrafts knows their shit with their soap base. Quick and easy to lather, very good primary and residual slickness, good consistency to make it easy to paint on, etc. My only complaint is that my face was very dry after this shave and even applying balm didn't make much difference. I'll see if that's a running theme this week with the other 5 varieties I have.\n\nToday's fragrance choice was unrelated to my shave soap. I got some new stuff in the mail this week and wanted to check one out while I'm at home for the weekend. I liked it so much yesterday that I wore it again today. Silver Black / Onyx (the name and advertised scent notes vary depending on which country it's sold in, but they're the same product and the two lists of scent notes combine to describe the entire scent) is a discontinued woody-aromatic ApH flanker. **Edit: upon further thinking, I came up with a better way to describe this fragrance, so I'm replacing my entire write-up about it. Everything below is edited.**\n\nSilver Black opens with fresh citrus, apple, and a bit of lavender and anise (it Is an ApH flanker, after all). When it gets to the heart it has a sort of citrus / basil / geranium haze at arm's length and a dry woody juniper / patchouli / vetiver skin scent hiding under that. The drydown arrives pretty quickly but it's subtle and very pleasant with subtle leather, musk, oakmoss, patchouli, sandalwood, and some vanilla-y undertones from the benzoin. It's subtle not in that it's weak, but subtle in that it doesn't stand out as \"look at me I'm wearing cologne\"... it's just a general haze of \"mmm, this smells better than humans usually smell\" that surrounds you. Perfect for office use, I'd say.\n\nA lot of reviews for this stuff said \"this is ApH meets Drakkar Noir.\" I totally disagree. I'd describe it as \"parallel universe Aventus\" because it has the same sort of structure (fruity fresh opening, sweet haze with woody base during the heart, sexy musky drydown), but with different notes for each stage. It's definitely not an Aventus dupe (it came out 4 years before Aventus, after all) but they're playing the same game.\n\nIt's like when somebody covers a song but in a different musical style, like Mark Ronson and Amy Winehouse covering the Zutons' \"Valerie,\" Jimi Hendrix covering Bob Dylan's \"All Along the Watchtower,\" or Johnny Cash covering Nine Inch Nails' \"Hurt.\" Same framework (chords, melody, lyrics, structure), but all the details are so different that they're hardly the same thing despite the structural similarities.\n\nIt's not like Executive Man, l'Aventure, or CNdIM, which would be more like a slavish tribute to the original thing that adds nothing new, such as Weezer's entire Teal album (which I love even though they add practically nothing new to the songs they're covering).",

Stirling Balm, in my experience is quite potent, so much so that it can cause my skin to be over moisturized and oily if over done. On this occasion I reapplied small dabs of the stuff three times, usually one helping would do.\n\nAnyways, about an hour after my shave I felt around and was pretty happy with what I had. This hobby has everything I need to make sure my face feels good daily.\n\nGame of thrones today...I'm not one of the haters, perhaps because I haven't read the books. Just excited to see how it all shakes out.\n\nHappy Sunday folks!",

I'm a sucker for the cologne dupes and this one didn't disappoint. I dont have a nose for picking out the individual notes but I'm a big fan of this scent. I really enjoy the slight menthol kick on the AS as well.\n\nI've just recently started going for 3 full passes as I feel my technique has improved and went for an ATG pass to finish as I was feeling good after my first two. Had a little irritation on my neck so I may swap that out for an additional XTG pass in the future.\n\nOne more shave with the Personna before going back to Polisilver and Feather to decide on my blade of choice. I'd have to put the Personna on par with the Voskhod so we'll see how the shave on Tuesday goes.",

I thoroughly enjoyed this soap. I swear on my life there is mint in this soap, but once I checked the scent notes no mint was found. This is a nice light pleasant scent, innoffensive.\n\nThis GSB has been chugging along no issues. Im really glad I revisited. Also ive been using my Stirling brush for quite some time now, but i will be setting my Laggards SHD tomorrow, so this might be the last time for a while. Still an absolutely fantastic brush\n\nHappy Sunday y'all",

Preshave - Unscented\n**Brush:** Stirling 2-Band Synthetic\n**Razor:** Mühle R41\n**Blade:** Gillette Nacet (2)\n**Lather:** [Chatillon Lux/Wholly Kaw - Yuzu/Rose/Patchouli - Soap (LE)](https://trythatsoap.com/collection/520/?product_type=soap_le)\n**Post Shave:** [Chatillon Lux - Yuzu/Rose/Patchouli - Aftershave](https://trythatsoap.com/collection/520/?product_type=aftershave)\n\n\nI shaved yesterday at about 11:30 AM with the R41 for the first time, and not only was it an impressive shave, but my face was still quite smooth when I went to bed last night at 11:00 PM. That's the longest lasting shave I've gotten from any DE.\n\nMy one complaint about the R41 is that the handle feels cheap, and it's really light. I've read great things about the Ikon Bulldog handle on that razor head, so I'll probably go for that in the future. Until then, I put my 6S handle on there. It made the razor feel much more substantial and gave it a nice weight.\n\nAnother great shave this morning with the R41. The YRP scent is one of my favorites, and both WK and CL make the best products in their respective categories.",

I hadn't opened my TOBS Sandalwood tub for at least a year, maybe two, and I had an idea in my head what the scent was. When scooping out a LG portion for someone the other day I smelled it again..That wasn't what I remembered. Oh well, sorry peeps. SW Sandalwood is better anyways.\n\nTwo weeks after ordering it, I finally got a decant of Herrod the other day, which is a favorite of the internet relay chat (as is Fenchurch). I probably should have used it on it's own with an unscented aftershave the first time, since Fenchurch is strong and closer to my nose, probably will next time or i'll just spray more later when Fenchurch wears off if I remember. It is a nice pairing though. Similar, but where Fenchurch is plum forward, the initial spray of Herrod is apricot forward which I like. It's gone 20-30 minutes later though and the tobacco is more forward. I dig it.",

The weather is calling for rain all week but I can't care less. It'll be nice just getting out to the beach and a pool and lots of fruity drinks.\n\nToday's shave was fantastic. Great lather and the scent smelled really good to me. Prefect for a beach vacation I guess. Very good performance as I took my time working in the lather.\n\nToday marked the first time a few weeks for a return to synthetic brush. It performs just fine but I felt myself wanting the feel of the badger brush. The massage from face lathering is missed. However painting on lather was easier with the synth.\n\nThe nacet worked awesome. I haven't even taken any other blade for the week. I feel good about this one.\n\nHave a great Sunday folks! The next post will be with a Appleton run by my side.",

WTG, XTG, and ATG clean up. I liked the shave today but I did get a slight irritation toward the end, during the ATG. I gave up on the blade and I'll use something else for the next time. The soap was light scented and enjoyable. Brush was fine. Chilling post shave and pretty clean face at the end. It was not a BBS but close enough.\n\n**The Soap** worked well. The citrus scent was very slight compared to Midnight in Tunisia. The MiT was very strongly scented but this one, I could barely smell it. It was almost unscented during the shave but I didn't mind it. Sometimes, I'd rather have a lightly scented soap than a strong one that I cannot stand. It performed well and gave me a good shave. I really think the Tussah Silk really holds the soap together into the creamy lather.\n\n**The Razor and Blade** combination worked decently. I was comfortable for most of the shave except for the ATG. Especially on the neck, I felt a bit of a razor burn. I made sure to put more lather on the neck to avoid further burn. At the end, my neck was fine visually but a bit stinging. Still a good razor & blade combo but I was pushing the life of the blade. Now I know that Astra SP works about 10 shaves for me.\n\n**The Brush** felt great. It is my first Yaqi brush and it still stands up to its name. Comfortable little brush with a good grippy handle. It does have some broken bristles in the middle and it's probably because I like the mash the brush against my face. I'm trying to tone it down a bit because I would like to use this brush for the long term. Anyhow, a great little brush for any day of the week.\n\n**The aftershave portion** was great. Mild toning with Thayer's and chilling portion by the Ice cold balm. Perfect combination for a casual day.\n\nOverall, a great shave. I did get a slight razor burn but the ice cold balm took care of that. I felt chilled and after couple hours, my face felt fine. For the next shaves, I'm thinking of using proraso or soap commander along with a boar brush/mild razor.",

I was a little nervous about how this morning's shave would go since I didn't shave yesterday, but I had no reason to fear. After a shower and some face lathering, this blade and OC plate took the hair off my face with absolutly no effort. A fantastic BBS shave with nothing but smooth happy skin. I got my face so damned smooth that I'll be faceturbating all day.\n\nThis soap and splash are really amazing. I picked up more of the blood orange in the scent this shave. I still predominantly pick up the bergamot and rosemary though. It is such a peaceful scent. A perfect way to start my day after the circus that was yesterday.\n\nHappy Monday!",

I fall firmly into the camp that it's quite good *if you're paying European prices*. I buy the small pucks for about €1.30 and have been doing so now for like 10 years. I find it a steal at that price. For the $10 or whatever it costs at Maggard's I can understand people bashing it and electing to go with higher quality artisans. Anyway that discussion motivated me to break out the classic green puck this morning and I was rewarded with a wonderful, clean, two-pass shave. Have a week, boys!",

I've heard rave reviews about the scent from a number of tobacco/leather fans, and it didn't disappoint. Too often these types of scents are cloying or inauthentic, but this one smells rich, deep, and enjoyable. Great work /u/ntownuser!\n\nGreat performance from the soap and splash.\n\nIf you haven't tried the Karve yet, it's a smooth and efficient razor at a price point that can't be beat. I wasn't a big fan of the sandblasted finish, but this one has an after-market two stage refinish that I think improves the aesthetics. A forced dark patina followed by a hand polish to leave the knurling dark.\n\nFinally I got to us a beautiful brush that's quickly becoming a favorite in my den. /u/cousin-eddie knocked this one out of the park, a blue/green milkglass that manages to look both classic and fresh at the same time. Can't argue with the Jefferson shape either, it's perfect in the hand.",

It isn't peppery Spanish cedar. It's a straightforward woody / nutty cedar smell. Inoffensive and plain, which is kinda the point. Good shaving performance as usual, and I didn't notice the irritation I got from the Alchemist on my last shave.\n\nDecent shave from the Lord again but it was better in the 3-piece razors.\n\nForecast is pretty cool for today but starting to reach normal spring temperatures later in the week, so I guess I better get in one last wearing of pseudo-Polo before it gets too warm for something this strong. It'll go nicely with the Cedar shave soap anyway.",

This is the version we sent out to everyone on Thursday + over the weekend, but I hadn't tried the final thing myself yet. Unfortunately the video didn't save to our IG story, so if you missed it live it's gone forever I think.\n\nLong story short, the soap turned out great and I'm really excited to start seeing the feedback. It looks like 40+ packages with VoA samples are out for delivery today which is pretty crazy. Please feel free to tag me if you post your thoughts so I can read them!",

I also try out my first Elite Razor knot, a Manchurian.\n\n#### ❧ Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Karve - Christopher Bradley A Plate SB ::: Gillette - Silver Blue ‹3 uses›)*\n\nThis head is so smooth!\n\nBut with the OC (yesterday), I felt the blade, but it was as if an expert was wielding it perfectly, with no aggressive feeling at all. It was a delight. It felt like the blade was gliding over my skin at the perfect zero-height.\n\nThis SB head, though, has almost no blade feel by comparison. I got an excellent close shave. So it looks like one might choose between them by the feel that one wants.\n\n#### ❧ Soap Notes\n*^(Stirling - One)*\n\nI liked the scent, just wished there was more of it to smell.\n\nScent: cologne type. Inspired by \"The One\"\n\nScent Strength: 3/10, very lightly present during shaving.\n\nThis one was perfect, though a little thick at first. I added more water after putting on the first pass. Excellent, providing great glide for the razor and protection. Tons of lather!\n\nBadger...\n\n50 second load with lightly-wet, dense, badger brush + 6 tsp water = 6-7 passes of lather. I overshot the mark with this one!\n\nBowl - I used the XL version of this bowl:\nhttps://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3392930\n\n#### ❧ Brush Notes\n*^(Elite Razor - Manchurian Fan CravingShaving Blue/White 26mm‹1 uses›)*\n\nFirst time with this one. Nice soft tips, beautiful knot, but a bit too much backbone for me. A little difficult to keep in splay. I'll keep working it though, and see if it relaxes.\n\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Smooth\n*Neck*: Smooth\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Cut flush to where I just see the tips (above average for me)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm)\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

      "body": "**A Wolfman Shave**\n\n**Lather:** Talbot Shaving - La Terre Verte (CB Collab)\n\n**Brush:** Turtleshio Anchor Synthetic\n\n**Razor: Wolfman WR2 .95** (on loan from u/hyvasuomi79)\n\n**Blade:** Astra SP (2)\n\n**Post:** LTV Splash\n\n**Frag;** Boucheron Jaipur Parfum\n\n\nThe hype is super real with the Wolfman, and there are several things that standout about this razor that I love.\n\n**Pros:**\n\nLet's get the obvious ones out of the way. The fully polished finish on this thing is gorgeous. Light jumps off it like few other razors I've come across - and it's present throughout the razor, no corners cut on the underside of the cap, inside edges, or the top of the base plate. Wolfman was the first I had heard that had threading this smooth. I think the Karve is similar in this smoothness but boy does the handle slide into place absolutely deathgripping the blade in place.\n\nThis in particular means the blade has no play and the user feels full control of it.\n\n**Important factors I noticed**\n\n-the Blade gap might be .95, but the exposure of the blade is minimal, so it doesn't shave like you might expect a \"high blade gap\" razor to shave. This also makes the sweet spot a little narrower than you might expect from a razor at this blade gap.\n\n-the sweet spot is super easy to find and maintain. I would guess this is due to the dramatically domed top cap\n\n-the razor feels slightly handle heavy but only a touch\n\n**The Shave**\n\nThe factors above made this the smoothest feeling razor I've ever used. But it shaves mildly. I can easily go over the same spot multiple and in the rare case I don't have the right angle it makes sense to find it and make sure I knock down the hair.\n\nAbsolutely no discomfort. I don't feel like I could cut myself with this thing, and a beginner would be fine to use this out of the box no issues.\n\nThe geometry, blade exposure, and ever-so-slight handle heaviness ensures a level of control have rarely if ever felt over a razor. The razor head allow me to easily get hairs on the hard to reach spots on my chin and neck.\n\n**Minor critiques/probably personal preferences**\n\n-I think I'd add a notch more of blade gap or exposure to make the razor slightly more efficient. This feels like a Karve A or B plate - but better. If I were to ever have the rare opportunity at a Wolfman WR2, I'd go for the 1mm. Over shaving would be really easy with this thing, because it feels so buttery smooth, why stop attacking - especially with a super slick soap!? A bit of blade feel is definitely something I've come to appreciate more recently in my journey.\n\n-Availability - we all know this one. There are alternative that are available and provide a similar feel, although there's something truly special about the feel of this razor. You can feel the precision and time that has gone into R&D, plus the fit and finish",

It would've been my first time with a Bison Base soap and it was in my favorite scent. Unfortunately that shave was a mess. I ended up nicking myself about 5 times and was really unsatisfied with how it went. However with two days growth and recovery and a slightly better lather, today went perfectly. Amazing slickness all around, scent was there the whole way, only two very minor nicks that washed right away, and I got as close to BBS as I can get (basically my version of BBS). I think what went wrong the first time was I only had a days growth and I went for my normal three passes (WTG, XTG, ATG) and ended up irritating myself. I find that I can not get a good shave with a days growth for the life of me. Which makes me slightly nervous for the lather games but that could be corrected with either another XTG instead of ATG or just settling for a two pass. I'm really impressed with the Bison Base and found that it picks up a LOT of soap because of how soft it is. This makes it really thirsty but you're rewarded with a shiny, peaky, and protective lather. Forgot to mention that last shave when I applied the post shave toner, it burned quite a bit. That was only because of my bad irritation and not the fault of the product as it literally contains no alcohol. Applied it this time around and it soaked in nicely to my damp face with no burning and soothes my skin nicely. Have a good Monday (if that's even possible) and thanks for the read!",

I absolutely love the mild scent this one has. Performance of this one is right on par with Pre de Provence. It comes as a puck wrapped in plastic, so it needs a container. I've grated mine into a parkway tub, and it's great for loading. That's something that I've battled with using PdP, their tins are on the small side, and I like big brushes. It works, but not optimal. I guess I don't mind too much because they're still in their tins lol.\n\nFor gaps, I went with something different again today. This worked great today too. I'm having trouble finding settings I absolutely do not like. Pretty much every setting on this razor provides a fantastic shave, depending on that days needs. When I need mild, 2ish is great, and I've shaved with it wide open, and it's still smooth! Can't go wrong!!!\n\nDFS again today. It rained a bit in the wee hours, and it's a little overcast, but we need all the rain we can get here in this desert of SoCal, so I'll take it!!!\n\nHappy Monday all!!!",

WTG, XTG, and ATG clean ups. The razor and blade combo was definitely mild. The soap was good but a bit drying and less slick than artisan soaps. Great little brush and very moisturizing post shave.\n\n**The Soap** worked decently. It is one of the soaps that I bought months back but never used it. The scent is one of the dirtiest sandalwood that I have. A bit complex and woody and really gets me going. It's not my favorite because of the dirtiness but it's a unique smell for sure. It performs decently but I did have some tug in the ATG. It's not the slickest but a good soap to work with.\n\n**The Razor and Blade** combination worked decently. It is one of the milder setups that I have and I didn't have much trouble. The ATG was a bit tuggy but nothing major. I really liked this combo early on but now, it seems like an average setup. The Voshkod blade is a bit iffy for me. I really enjoyed it but it seems like the more I use it, the less sharp/comfortable it becomes. Maybe this is one of the blades that perform well for couple shaves and goes dull after. I'll give it couple more shaves and see how it goes. And for EJ DE89, it's a classic and remains to be one of my favorite.\n\n**The Brush** felt great. Easy little brush to work with. It lathered up the soap well and lasted enough until the end. I could've put in more water at the start but that's more of a preference thing.\n\n**The aftershave portion** was great. Mild toning with Thayer's and a good moisturizing balm by Stirling. A good combination for any day.\n\nOverall, a good shave. ATG was again a bit uncomfortable and I'm trying to figure out the reason. At this point, it's either the soap or the blade. Most of the blades are getting to high uses and some soaps are just not slick enough for me. I find Stirling to be a perfect fit for me but I'll continue to experiment with the rest. For the next shaves, I'll continue to use the razor&blade combo with a artisan soap and see it that works better.",

My wife found a small chest of drawers a few days back and though it would make good storage for my soaps and razors. I'm taking this to mean that I can buy more gear.\n\nAnyhow, awesome shave as usual from Icarus. I forgot how unique Darkfall is. It's all dark, spicy base notes. Amber, resin, perhaps a little Oud. Its bold and lovely all in one. I think my fragrance tempers of a little bit.\n\nHave a good Sunday y'all!\n\nRobot",

I woke up after four hours of sleep and me and my wife finished packing our bags and got the kids loaded up for the airport. As we were driving we realized that there was no way we were going to make the flight on time and instead we decided to cancel our flight and rental car last min and make the drive from SF to LA instead. Six hour later we arrive at our VBRO and surprisingly the kids were troopers about 85% of the time and honestly that feels like a win for me.\n\nOnce I unloaded everything my wife got the kids playing in the back yard and I went and grabbed some snacks and breakfast food for tomorrow. We got our kids in bed by 6:30pm (another miracle) and I was finally afforded the chance to take a shower and enjoy a relaxing shave.\n\nDeciding what to bring along on a trip is always tricky. I don't envy the guys like /u/ItchyPooter that has to travel during the Lather Games last year. On one hand you can bring along a bunch of sample jars or you can try to pick one soap and just go with that for a week. In my case I choose my old standby and thanks to /u/Ugmug it was almost all a PIF (Your the real hero buddy).\n\nI'm not going to talk about Philips Fougere a lot. I like it. It's clean, green and fresh. It's what started my love of Fougeres and while not the best performance, I know how to maximize the lather and rarely have a bad shave from it. I recommend everyone try it at least once or twice.\n\nI've been shaving a lot with vintage razors lately thanks to a generous soul who sent me a large allotment to try for an extended period of time. Prior to coming over to shaving I was really big into watches and in particular, vintage watches. I enjoy using objects that had a life before me. The patina and history of an object gives it a weight that can't be replicated by something brand new. The aging tells a story of you will and speaks about a time before planned obsolescence, when things were made to last a lifetime.\n\nTomorrow I'm taking my family to Disneyland and my kids have no idea. I am legit excited to be able to surprise them with it.\n\nHope y'all have a great day!\n\nRobot",

Wasn't super smooth shave, but the blade was less aggressive than the other blades I've tried which worked well.\n\nAfter the Rain is one soap I can go to all year round, it's a great scent that just fits in any time. Decided to try and pair it with Cape Heartache whilst I'm working through the sample set I got. Its a more piney resinous smell than After the Rain but pairs well.",

In fact, I'll probably use up the remainder of what I have this week, I just wanted to give Stirling the proper treatment it deserves. I started with a soaking wet brush, loaded 20 seconds, then transferred the slurry into a bowl (way too wet for direct face lather), at which point I worked it up until it started to hold its form. It was a perfect consistency, after so many mornings of good-but-not-great lather. I liberally wet my face before applying the aftershave (not sure if that was necessary, I think I mixed up my notes between it at Chattilon Lux toners). It worked, and I expect to carry the scent for several hours.\n\nLife is short, shave with good gear.",

Catie's Bubbles and Captain's Choice come to mind. Both make an excellent cream. For me they each can hold their own against much higher priced creams. Before I bought this cream I had only one cream and was looking to get another one. In an unrelated conversation with Casie Maggard, she mentioned that CC had spent two years developing a cream they had just brought to market. She said she thought it was a pretty good cream. Based on that conversation I bought this jar. I am pleased with the purchase.",

In all honesty, it did smell a bit mustier than I recalled at first, but it opened into a much more evened tone. I've tried to stay away from notes, but I do remember reading incense and \"jazz cigarettes\" (love the wording btw) which I could see being the basis of some of that mustiness. I can't put my finger on what the sweeter hints I'm picking up are, but maybe I'll figure that out eventually. Overall, wonderfully scented set here and now I have no choice but to purchase a full size bottle of the parfum.\n\nAs for day two of the Dorco, I've already thrown that shitty blade away and will not be reusing these blades this week. I mean, yesterday was rough but today was beyond bad. I've got a few weeping spots and I feel like I shaved with a cheese grater. But I WILL persevere and finish out these terrible blades!",

Increasing clouds, with a high near 66. South wind 5 to 10 mph. Chance of precipitation is 60%. New rainfall amounts of less than a tenth of an inch, except higher amounts possible in thunderstorms. High tide at 1:51 this afternoon.\n\nStarted killing my next soap today. I hadn't really looked at this tub since the last time I used it and there is a considerable ring of death. But this is the one soap that I have a back up of, so I'm not to worried about killing this one off. It is one of the wife's favorites, as well as being one that I like as well.\n\nShavette shave number 3. Don't know if I didn't hydrate the lather enough, or my technique is way off, but when doing my right cheek it felt really tuggy, and not comfortable. Then I did my left cheek and it was fine, So i am inclined to believe that I didn't get the technique down. It is a learning process for sure.\n\nHave a nice Tuesday everyone!",

I went back to the Polisilver which was my favorite blade the first time through my sampler. A couple small nicks on my chin due to carelessness but got a really close shave WTG XTG XTG. Dont think I'll be able to get BBS on my neck without bringing in some irritation so I may save that for down the road a bit.\n\nSeville quickly became one of my favorite soaps the first time I tried it. I wasn't getting a great post shave feel on it so I added a lot more water than I thought I needed and wasn't disappointed. A&E has been my top post shave feel but BaM & DG are right there for me.",

Either way, a spiced baked goods sort of scent. Not too strong either and doesn't stick around very long with only subtle hints of scent post-shave. Good performance as is well known.\n\nCool spring days with chances of showers call for Paco Rabanne pour Homme. Too green for winter, too strong for summer heat, just right for spring.",

      "body": "Tuesday 5/7 SOTD\n\n* Razor: Charcoal Goods brass L2 SB on 100mm Torpedo handle\n* Blade: Vokshod (4)\n* Brush: Envy White 25mm badger\n* Soap: B&M Reserve Waves\n* Post: B&M Reserve Cool splash\n* Frag: Lageerfeld Classic EDT\n\nProduct Notes:\n\n* **Razor / Blade**: Vokshod continues to impress, shaving about as well as a Polsilver for about 1/3 of the price. The Voki lasts for only about 5 good shaves versus the Pol's 7 for me, so there is some trade off, but the Vokshod is still a better bargain. Plus the Vokis are always cleaner blades with less wax on em that the average Pol. Not a big deal, but the double wrapping and clean blade appearance of Vokshod appeals to my inner neat freak.\n* **Brush**: These things were so hot back in 2015-16 or so. Kind of a different world in brush terms. The design has not aged well. The bright blue aluminum handle is still purty, but the knot feels like a badger / boar hybrid, with all the detriments of a bad boar. Scratchy, and lacks enough density to reliably distribute lather for a face lathering shave that uses a single loading. It's adequate, but no more than that in the current market, when so many better and cheaper badgers can be found from the likes of Stirling and Razorock. Maybe I'll get the handle re-knotted...\n* **Soap:** Bestest performing base for me in one of my favorite scents - not too elaborate, but lively and interesting.\n* **Post**: This shows the reason why I look for a soap with good post shave. Mr. Dry Faced self can normally only use Reserve splash when the weather is warm and humid... unless I use a soap with great post shave, like Reserve, in which case I can use Reserve splash on a day like today with temps in the high 60s (F) and humidity in the 50% range. I like being able to use Reserve splashes, as they smell great and work amazingly well (save for the slight drying effect which will only affect the most desiccated visages). It is neat (and not really surprising) that the two members of the Reserve family work so well together!",

SHD is far superior for me. The Maseto has some scritch, and still hasn't really opened up although I don't think i've used it more than half a dozen times or so, I don't love the stubby style handle on such a large brush. I just went back and checked what this brush cost compared to the SHD and the SHD is the no brainer recommendation from me now that Maggard has some cheap handles up on the site (but spring for a Dogwood, really).\n\n\nFirst use of Oleo. The scent is dead on Virgin Island Water. The soap was pretty slick, but I didn't do it any favors using it with the 30mm Maseto that soaks up water and it kept thinning out on me. I'll give it another go with a brush i'm more familiar with very soon.\n\n\nI've had the Passione Aftershave for a few weeks and have been enjoying it, and I sprung for the last bottle of the EDT they had at Maggard, the FOMO was real. The EDT opening is similar to the fruit forward style of the aftershave, but then the drydown gets more fougere-y. I couldn't figure out why it was advertised as a fougere other than having some of the fougere compnents in it until i smelled the aftershave. Excellent job by the upside down perfumer.\n\n\nSappy McSapperson - I was chatting with Mrs. Oleo about the Soap, and Mr. APR about the AS/EDT last night, and once again realized this morning while shaving what a cool community this is. At any point depending on what i'm using, the maker of my soap, shampoo, shave soap, aftershave, EDT, brush or razor is a PM away to help or answer any questions, and some even join in on the shitposting from time to time keeping things even keel.",

Went bit Marco on the Jacinthe and built up a nice, slick lather. One pass WTG, one XTG, and a final clean-up pass ATG and I am facing the day BBS.\n\nI noticed yesterday that Maggard has Barrister and Mann's two LE fougeres (Aromatique and Imperiale) on clearance and I realized that I had not yet used the samples I'd previously purchased. When I brought it up in chat last night, someone remarked that because Will only used naturals rather than aroma chemicals in composing the fougeres, they would only get better with time. So I figured it was a good time to actually get into the samples and find out how these things smell.\n\nToday, I'm trying Fougere Imperiale. I only sprayed it about 15 minutes ago, but so far it does not disappoint. It's bright and smooth. There's a bit of an earthy undertone to it. If I take a really deep sniff, I catch a slightly sharp note. I'm looking forward to seeing how this develops through the day.",

Not pipe tobacco, not cherry tobacco, not tobacco smoke, not a cigar. Just tobacco with a hint of honey. I've been on the lookout for a tobacco scent like this for a long time and I was finally able to acquire it in a trade. I actually met up with a fellow wetshaver and internet stranger yesterday to smell some soaps and make some trades. It was a little strange at first sitting in a hotel lobby sniffing soaps with someone you've never met before, but I got over the initial weirdness within a few minutes and just said eff it. There's a lot weirder stuff I could be doing right now, lol. I walked away with this soap and the bison Mayflower I was looking for.\n\nAs for the soap performance itself, it was fantastic. It was my first time using a Ballenclaugh soap and for those of you that haven't tried it, I highly recommend it. I know it's not the easiest soap to get, but it's a damn good one. I finished up the shave with Fenchurch aftershave because, well, it's the peak scent of tobacco-y goodness. Happy Tuesday shaves all!",

This soap takes a ton of water, is dense and slick, and reminds me of Grooming Dept Mallard despite being entirely vegan. This soap is an achievement, and I feel lucky to have a tub.\n\nI'm also enjoying West Egg, a really interesting yet approachable scent that's getting rave reviews. It has a champagne-like opening with a fougere-like drydown that maintains a bit of sweetness from the opening. Very fun and definitely suits the classy Great Gatsby theme.\n\nMy second use of the TDR Fanchurian v2 comes just as /u/geekyoldrob is almost out of v2 knots. But it's a stellar performer, denser than the original with more backbone.",

Also we whip up some Stirling again, this time with a smaller brush.\n\n#### ❧ Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Karve - Christopher Bradley B Plate OC ::: Gillette - Silver Blue ‹4 uses›)*\n\nGreat shave. Minimal blade feel, but nice closeness. Pretty smooth, too. Was pretty easy to shave without risk of cuts and razor burn. This one seems like a nice balance between comfort and efficient cutting... with a slight lean towards comfort.\n\n#### ❧ Soap Notes\n*^(Stirling - Spice)*\n\nScent: Old Spice inspired.\n\nScent Strength: 7-8/10, very present during shaving. Finally!\n\nVery good slick lather today.\n\n50 second load with lightly-wet, small-ish, soft boar brush + 4 tsp water = 5 passes of lather.\n\nMight try loading for 40-45 seconds next time, if I have a similar brush.\n\nYep. This little boar definitely generated less lather with the same load time, as the 26mm Manchurian. Probably will need to load this brush for 10-15 sec longer than that badger, on average... at least with Stirling.\n\n\nBowl - I used the XL version of this bowl:\nhttps://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3392930\n\n#### ❧ Brush Notes\n*^(Semogue - 1800 Boar‹13 uses›)*\n\nThis one is starting to feel a bit sparse. So maybe an o-ring around the base will help. Not a lot of split tips, yet, but I'm sure that's coming. Couple hour soak prior to today's shave.\n\nSome might not like the mid-low backbone of this brush at this point. But it's very comfy, and I'm fine with it.\n\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Cut flush to where I just see the tips (above average for me)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm)\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

I like this scent - I like it a tiny bit less once lathered, but still, like it. I had one of the best lathers with a badger brush ever - as good as the lathers I get with a synth. This is almost certainly my favorite badger brush - I wish the loft was few mm lower though. But still, love it. The handle is so comfy and light.\n\n\nI think I will sell this WR-1 soon. This is my only Wolfman at this time - definitely the shiniest razor I have. But I am not in awe of the performance. It is a great shaver, but I like every other razor in my den more. It feels a little harsh during ATG pass, regardless of the blade. I guess I am keeping it for the sake of variety. Astra worked relatively well in it though.",

First time I've gone back to the X3 since I fell in love with the Voskhod blades and this combo did not disappoint. The only issue is I somehow nicked my upper lip in 2 small spots on my first pass. I've never really had this happen before so the only thing I can imagine is I dug in a bit too much while getting reacquainted with this razor head.\n\nAlso, thanks to /u/needsmorementhol for the advice of not needing to soak boar brushes before using them on Sunday's Daily Questions thread. It probably still got almost 5 minutes in water while I got everything ready, but I had no issues with a very short soak on the boar brush last night.",

WTG, XTG, and ATG clean ups. Today's shave was a bit better than last times. I think the cream definitely helped with its slickness. The brush felt better today and post shave kept the skin nice and moist throughout the day.\n\n**The Soap** worked well. This one is only a travel size so I have couple more uses out of it. It's a great cream for a casual shave. Smells a bit medicinal and cologney. It performs excellently and whipped up a creamy and slick lather. It lasted throughout the entire shave and I would shave with it again. I think it's on the pricey side but it can contend with any top soaps for me.\n\n**The Razor and Blade** combination worked well. The blade was tugging a bit towards the end but it felt good most of the time. I want to push the blade couple more times to see how long it can go. It's not uncomfortable but I just have to be more careful during ATG. Great razor and I love the feel and the heft of the handle.\n\n**The Brush** felt great. Looks amazing but performs a bit less than its looks. It's on the flimpsy/springy side but it still whipped up a good lather. It's not my favorite but it works well. The grip is pretty big so I would not recommend it for small handed people.\n\n**The aftershave portion** was great. A mild post shave setup. The Bulldog balm has a similar scent to the nancy boy cream. A bit medicinal but it performs well every time. And I didn't use any menthol to day so that I can save it for next times.\n\nOverall, a good shave. I felt great throughout the shave and I'm excited for another shave tomorrow. I'm going to have to shave pretty much everyday until late June so I'll continue with the mild setups. I can't use an OC for everyday shaves so that'll have to wait a bit. I'm thinking of using another synthetic with some mentholated products.",

      "body": "**Soap:** Proraso Sensitive cream\n\n**Brush:** Escali badger\n\n**Razor:** Feather Popular\n\n**Blade:** Feather [1]\n\nSpent the evening at my folks', and it was very much a return to my beginning days of wetshaving. My old kit sat exactly where I left it in the bathroom!\n\nThere isn't much to say about the Escali brush around these parts. It's scritchy, sheddy, and overall just shitty. Not to mention woefully undersized. But we all had to start somewhere, right?\n\nLikewise with Proraso, IMO. With sensitive skin and not much knowledge of wetshaving, I was all in with this line of the brand after finishing my tube of the Sandalwood variety. Even got the complete set with the fancy tin case and everything!\n\nThe cream had firmed up a bit in the 2 years-plus since I've used it. Dab on the brush and go. It needed more water than usual to dial in, but once I got it there it was like new. It's certainly not the slickest, but it's a great beginner shave and I can see why I liked it so much. I wish I had a post shave though it wasn't an option for me considering I had nothing on hand I'd want to leave on my face following a shave. While I didn't have any irritation it did leave my skin quite tight and dry.\n\nThe Feather razor was my second after my Merkur 23c. I didn't appreciate it at the time, but I love how much the razor tames the fabled aggressiveness of the Feather blade while maintaining a smooth shave. The only knock in hindsight is build quality (plastic) and weight, but that lightness taught me to let the blade do the work. 100% of the pressure is in your hands here.\n\nOverall a serviceable shave. Three passes on my face, only one on my neck considering what I was working with and how temperamental it can be.\n\nI'll definitely appreciate going back to my higher end stuff this week!!",

The L'Occitane cream performs very well, it hits that sweet spot of thickness very well and absorbs really well.\n\nSecond time wearing this fragrance and I really like it, I can't describe it, it's both clean and leathery at the same time but also a bit musty. It's smells different every time I go back to it.",

I love the smell of apples and Pomona brings a *lot* of apple to the table. Of course being SW there' are other notes in there to round it out. To me it's sort of like how apple mulled wine would be if that was a thing.\n\nI know I'm preaching to the choir when it comes to SW's base, but man it's just such a pleasure to work with. Easy to load, easy to lather, good times.\n\nHappy 🐪 day all!",

The lather was typical for Stirling, just average and the scent off of the puck is pleasantly strong and cologne-y. It comes across as a dupe, I'm assuming Burberry - London (as I've read). After shave 14 I believe it is time to retire the Ladas blade.\n\nTomorrow starts the **Battle of the Barbershops!!!** I'm looking forward to your feedback!",

Ambassador\n**Blade:** Astra SP (1)\n**Lather:** Southern Witchcrafts - Lavender\n**Post Shave:** [Southern Witchcrafts - Necromantic - Aftershave (Alcohol Free)](https://trythatsoap.com/collection/855/?product_type=aftershave_noalc)\n**Fragrance:** [Southern Witchcrafts - Necromantic - Eau de Parfum](https://trythatsoap.com/collection/855/?product_type=eaudeparfum)\n**Song:** [Black Label Society - Stillborn](https://youtu.be/9ZGt4JVX860)\n\nFirst shave with my brand new Rex Ambassador, and it sure impressed. I've been wanting one for a long time, and when the a 15% coupon showed up, I took my chance. Build quality is second to none, tolerances seem very tight, absolutely stunning. I thought I would try setting 3 to get a feel for it. Shaving angle was easy to find and did my usual two pass shave WTG/ATG. Before I finished my shave, I thought I would need to move the dial up for my next shave since I wasn't feeling the blade at all. My mistake, because after two passes, I got one of my closest, no irritation shaves yet. This razor is deceptively efficient, even on the middle setting.\n\nSW nailed it with this offering. If you're a fan of Lavender at all, just blind order the whole set of this one. By far the best Lavender scented soap I have tried. This will be an instant buy the next time I allow myself to make a full order.\n\nZakk Wylde is still one of my favorite guitarists, but I do believe most of his best work is with Ozzy. This is one of the few songs with his own band that I dig.",

I'm starting to feel like all these SW soaps smell a little nutty on the puck. Maybe it's something in their base. **Has anybody else noticed that with their SW soaps?** Anyway, it turns into Lilac once it's lathered up. It didn't leave much scent post-shave. I've noticed more notes when I hand-lathered it just to check out the scent, but in use on my face it's basically just a mild lilac soap. I expected to smell some of the woodsy notes so I picked Drakkar Noir for fragrance with its fir-heavy base, but it turns out it's doing 100% of the heavy lifting instead of teaming up with the soap.\n\nLord was okay again. Not as perfect as when it was brand new, but still serviceable. Trying out this \"shave every day\" thing as a test run before the Lather Games arrive in June. It's not as bad as I expected it would be, but... it's not great either. No razor burn yet, but certainly a bit of whisker irritation now and then.",

This time, tried the new soap from SW, Valley of Ashes. I like it.\n\n#### ❧ Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Karve - Christopher Bradley B Plate SB ::: Gillette - Silver Blue ‹5 uses›)*\n\nExcellent pairing of blade and razor. Not a lot of blade feel, but a little. Picture a head in the mid range of comfort and efficient cutting, and then lean it a bit towards comfort. That's where I put the B SB.\n\nTo compare, the OC version of this is just a little more aggressive, while not being actually aggressive. Nice comfortable blade feel.\n\n#### ❧ Soap Notes\n*^(Southern Witchcrafts - Valley of Ashes)*\n\nThem: \"Coal, Tar, Bourbon, Tobacco, Bitter Citrus, Smoke, Leather, Motor Oil, Burning Rubber, Diesel, Clove, Birch Tar, Bergamot\"\n\nScent: I liked it. A bunch of notes in this one. The burning rubber and tar and leather seem to stand out the most to me. After working up the lather, I think the Bergamot and Bitter Citrus came out. I'm glad the clove was not a dominant note. I think this one will be an interesting few shaves as perhaps more and more nuance comes out with use.\n\nScent Strength: 4-5/10, present during shaving.\n\nAbsolutely wonderful lather. Creamy, but protected my skin very well and gave Japanese bullet train levels of glide. Consistency of soap was really more of a cream.\n\n1/4 tsp soap + lightly-wet, soft boar brush + 2 tsp water = 4 passes of lather.\n\nBowl - I used the XL version of this bowl:\nhttps://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3392930\n\n#### ❧ Brush Notes\n*^(Semogue - 2000 Boar‹13 uses›)*\n\nsuch a comfy brush with many split tips. Massagey and soft.\n\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Cut flush to where I just see the tips (above average for me)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm)\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

Vokshods normally last for 5 good shaves for me, so this is usual.\n* **Brush:** I have this same handle with a two band badger, and think the black synth knot used here is a much better shaver. Handle is wonderful, water resistant, attractive, and with excellent fit and finish.\n* **Soap:** Once the king of the shaving world circa 2017, Nuavia is now merely a pretty good Euro soap. The scent work is quite good and the strength admirably potent, but performance for me is a B+ in comparison to stuff like WK, Eufros, and B&M Reserve. Nuavia in particular needs a good post shave to help the face afterwards, and the brand's suggestion to use the residual lather from the shave as an after shave treatment did not serve me well on the several occasions that I attempted it.\n* So lovely packaging, awesome scent, and interesting for all the performance it extracts from its vegan base, but hardly worth the price point in technical terms. IMO Nuavia should either cut the price or change the base, but this product may still appeal to EU customers who do not have easy / cheap access to all the great relatively inexpensive tallow high performance bases that those in the US do.",

I'm really glad I ordered it because I liked the scent out of the sample jar. I'm not great at describing scents but this one is blended quite well and is not as dark or as strong I thought it would be.\n\nI would describe the scent as manly yet sophisticated. I got whiffs of the leather, smoke and tar but also sweetness from the tobacco. I had my wife smell it once lathered and she didn't hate it which is a plus but she admittedly enjoys West Egg more. She said she got more of a leather scent.\n\nI really also like SW's vegan base. It's top notch and I have no trouble whipping up a great lather even with my hard water. I'll use up the rest of the sample before deciding on the set.",

I just kinda mixed it together with the balm and it went on easy and both absorbed quickly leaving no greasy feeling behind. Not sure if thats bad to mix them or not but works for me. Also, I really like these Voskhods in this razor. Super smooth and plenty of sharpness.",

The scent was much more floral than I would have expected, but I still really like it. It's light and clean, which is exactly what I look for. Very easy to lather. Great slickness. I stuck to a two-pass, WTG + XTG shave as I like to keep it conservative with soaps I've never before used. Skin looks and feels great post-shave. Quite satisfied. Looking forward to getting more acquainted with this base as I finish out the week with my sample.",

The fact that /u/phteven_j was so pumped about this, knowing his affection for this genre, furthered the intrigue. Off the sample, my first thought was it's a lighter, gentler Stag. A Stag for everyday, if you will. My second thought, or realization, was 5 minutes later was still huffing it. Courtney did an amazing job taking these scents, telling a story, and not making me want to gag. Off the sample I definitely pick up the leather, and then some of the tar/rubber/oil/gas. I don't get much citrus or bergamot, but I suspect them being there is what's keeping it in check....\n\n\nThen I gave it to the wife to smell. She just kind of scrunched up her face and noped it..Then I showed her the scent notes and got a \"those are some sick f*cks\" comments. So cheers /u/reguyw_nothingtolose and SW, managed to get a reaction out of her like I haven't seen since Lamplight, lol. Rare company!\n\n\nWhen lathered, the scent pretty much stayed similar as it was off the dry sample to me. Went through a three pass shave and it was not unpleasant. I thought about using an unscented aftershave to see how the smell sat with me but my wife was still home and I prefer to not have to fend for myself for dinner tonight. Performance of SW doesn't need to be discussed, it's fantastic.\n\n\nDue to the wife factor there is zero chance of me picking up the aftershave and certainly not the EDP, but maybe the soap. I'll use it again before Saturday. Final thought, the fact that Courtney was able to take these notes and turn it into something that i'm even considering using for ~50-75 more shaves shocked the hell out of me :)",

WTG, XTG, and ATG clean ups. Most of it was fine but I couldn't buff some areas without the lather. I had a better impression of the soap last time but it wasn't as slick as I'd like. Razor and blade was good enough but I'll change out the blade now. Good post shave portion.\n\n**The Soap** worked well. The Artisan Soap Shoppe are one of my favorites because they have such a simple ingredient list and easy to lather/shave product. I thought I had better result last time but today was a bit different. The soap seemed less slicker than past shaves and I'm not sure why. With the tallow added, I'm guessing it should be more slick. I'll try again tomorrow and see what's up.\n\n**The Razor and Blade** combination worked well. I feel that the blade is giving up on me as it feels more dull each shave. The razor is great but I definitely need to change out the blade. No more hoarding a finished blade. I want to try a fresh Voshkod blade and see the difference. I'll do that tomorrow.\n\n**The Brush** felt great. It is a bit more scritchy than I would like it to be. It's definitely not comfortable but not painful either. It whipped up a good lather and did its job. The horse hair is a bit unkempt though. It's not a pretty brush but I'd say its worth it to try a horse hair brush out.\n\n**The aftershave portion** was great. First time in a while where I hadn't felt the zing with the alum block. A smooth alum across the face with no sting. Also, the balm really chilled the face and cooled it down. Wonderful combo.\n\nOverall, a good shave. Very nice shave but not a BBS. I'll try the same setup tomorrow except with a fresh Voshkod blade. Still experimenting with all the products and it's a joy to be able to do so.",

Both my wife and I love the citronella scent. For both of us it is a very calming scent. We also just set up our fire pit this past weekend and had our bug candles burning, so this'll kick in some good summer night memories with us. When I woke her up after my shave, I got a sleepy smile and a \"You smell like citronella, I like it.\"\n\nThe performance of the Sheep Tallow is good. It easily makes a nice pillowy lather (even in hard water). The glide is medium and I'll probably play with adding more water next time to see how it changes.\n\nI got quite a bit more feedback from the AS than what I was expecting. I'm not sure if it was from something in the splash or because I was pushing my skin through a 3 pass shave without watching my lather slickness. I'll give it another go in a few days and see.\n\nHappy Thursday!",

On theme for today is Dapper Dragon. This soap performs about average for me and the scent isn't all that great. All I smell is Ouzo or Sambuca (Anise). However, I gotta say Scale Polish could be the single best post shave out there ( I have not tried liniment). Adds a little cooling and I could smell it hours later. Left my face feeling hydrated and smooth.\n\nI'm not a big Black Metal fan, but I had gotten a CD, yes CD, free a long time ago and thought I would give them a shot. Many would consider Cradle of Filth at the top of the Black Metal heap and for good reason. Songs are well thought out and very musical, only thing that turns me away is the sometimes the screaming style of Dani Filth. However, I think it's part of what makes this genre so interesting. This style is what makes the genre. Just like your first beer, I think the more you listen to it, the more you learn to appreciate it.",

A bunch of notes in this one. The burning rubber and tar and leather seem to stand out the most to me. After working up the lather, I think the Bergamot and Bitter Citrus came out. I'm glad the clove was not a dominant note. I think this one will be an interesting few shaves as perhaps more and more nuance comes out with use.\n\nScent Strength: 4-5/10, present during shaving.\n\nAbsolutely wonderful lather. Creamy, but protected my skin very well and gave Japanese bullet train levels of glide. Consistency of soap was really more of a cream.\n\n1/4 tsp soap + lightly-wet, soft, badger brush + 4 tsp water = 5 passes of lather.\n\nBowl - I used the XL version of this bowl:\nhttps://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3392930\n\n#### ❧ Brush Notes\n*^(Elite Razor - Manchurian Fan CravingShaving Blue/White 26mm‹3 uses›)*\n\nSame as past use.

His soap base is quite minimal when you analyze the ingredients and compare it to a top tier soap, but I still think it performs just as well. I highly recommend this to anyone who likes pipe scents. It's a must have!\n\nCoincidentally I don't use this one as much as I'd like to because I was stupid and bought a 2oz tub instead of the 4oz tub and it's expensive as hell to ship soap to Canada.",

I've been using this brush and razor almost every shave lately, and the soap/splash set is brand new. Thankfully this isn't for points, yet...\n\nI've been wearing Nefertiti parfum extrait for a week or so, and already not looking forward to the end of my sample size bottle. The sophisticated honey accord is intoxicating and carries through the full wear, with a rich, warm base of oud, vetiver, musk, and incense. There's a bit of dark green in there along with a supporting floral, and while the scent notes list \"jazz cigarette\", the cannabis note is subtle and supports the green resinous components.\n\nMy grandmother was a socialite in the jazz era, she loved Sarah Vaughan and loved to dress to the nines and go out. I imagine she would have loved this fragrance on a night when she wanted something rich and indulgent.\n\nThe Karve continues to impress day after day. The head looks a little clunky aesthetically and I'd like to try the slightly longer handle, but otherwise it's an amazing razor.\n\nThe Icarus base is becoming one of my go to bases, flawless in every respect. The trick is to load with a slightly damper brush than normal, and add water for a slick dense lather in 60 seconds start to finish. It helps to have a lather monster like a 28mm Declaration, as it holds plenty of water to get the job done quickly. I'm grateful for soaps that aren't fussy yet still perform at an elite level.",

I used the 4 plate for my shave today, and initially I felt a bit more blade on my face than my R89 but as the first pass went along it felt much more \"mild\" (which I believe has to do with the weight of the razor doing all the work) and as I finished I was shocked by how my hair was removed just going WTG. Finished up with an ATG pass and was BBS everywhere except for the center of my neck.\n\nI know it's only a first impression but I love this razor.",

So, let me begin by saying how fortunate I am to have a job that even has the option to work remotely. I had planned that today would be the day I'd work from home, since I have a doctors apt set for smack-dab middle of the morning. I still planned on waking at the same time, do my same morning routine, and start at 7, same as if I were in the office. Well, my alarm never goes off. In fact, I don't wake up until my wife's alarm goes off at 7. We both wake up confused and disoriented (but well-rested) by my existing presence in bed. I check my phone, it shows a missed alarm at 5:30. The alarm had gone off but it had been muted. I mean, of all the days to do this, my phone has a sixth sense to do it on a day when I work remotely, but it's still rather inconvenient. Why silencing alarms is even an option in this day and age is beyond me, but it's happened before I'm making a move to a traditional alarm clock. Not a smart clock, but one that has an obnoxious alarm but works when it's supposed to.\n\nAnd here I am writing about it for an extra 5 minutes, well past the time I envisioned starting my day, I better get to work. As for the shave? I don't remember the last time I used YRP, I thought it could use some much-needed love. The lather took some time because I could just keep adding water and it kept gaining volume and slickness, I had a fun time with it, screw my late wake-up. I'm sure it'll make an appearance during the games.\n\nLife is short, shave with good gear.",

Calm wind becoming southeast around 5 mph in the afternoon. High tide at 3:26 this afternoon.\n\n**Razors/Blade:** If Theme Thursday is a theme that doesn't just include soap/splash scents, but is more general I will try to match the whole shave. Today that did not happen because it was head shave day. And the dustiest razor I have is a Schick Hydro-Magic. That this is all sorts of aggressive, to the point that I don't even like shaving my face with it. So I stuck with the Schick Grip for the head and clean-up passes on the face. Still getting the hang of the shavette, but seems to be progressing little by little, like the Semogue 610 break in.\n\n**Brush:** This was my 4th brush I bought. The first two being Van Der Hagen Badgers, the third being a clipped, scratchy Simpsons that I got with the Maggard's starter kit, it's amazing that after those brush I even tried a badger again. This brush was heaven compared to those other hell beasts. I used this brush exclusively until I had enough cash to buy a handle from Bristle Bruskwerks and a B3 Declaration knot. While I probably won't sell this brush, it is relegated to back-up duty as I prefer animal hair brushes.\n\n**Soap/Balm:** This is probably my dustiest soap/splash combo. I got this last summer in a lot from /u/uselessgreggy and have used it maybe once in that time. Which should tell you enough about my collection. The scent of the tub is very nice, not really in your face, and lathered it stays that way as well. Now the balm is a nice product, but smell is just that, a balm. I don't really get any added scent, so it's not one that I really reach for.\n\nHave a nice Thursday everyone!",

Since the kiddo, I've been in the habit of putting him down and just kicking back relaxing on the couch, then rushing a shave in the morning before work. It was a lot more fun to take my time and really relax and enjoy the ritual and smells. Probably been 8+ months since I last used this scent, but I really like it. After a warm afternoon of golfing, the smell of the beach was very inviting. Happy Friday Jr everyone, we're almost there!",

Right off the puck it's pretty mild but it reminds me of proper sandalwood wood, not just sandalwood-scented creams. Proraso Red might be smooth and creamy, but this stuff is pleasantly woody. It's not too different from their Cedar to my nose but I like this one better. **If I wanted a mildly scented / high performance vegan shave soap, I think it would be this stuff.**\n\nStill getting used to this \"shave every day\" thing in prep for the Games in June. Right away today I could tell that this Lord Platinum was not as sharp as it started out, so I thought \"okay, better shave with an extra light touch today,\" and still got a nice BBS finish, reminding me that *I should shave like that every day.*\n\nMaybe my last time wearing ApH this spring before the weather gets too warm for it to be appropriate. I thought its spicy, woody, barbershop notes would compliment the Sandalwood nicely and I've been wearing old-man-ish scents all week, so might as well continue the trend today! Might have to get a little more creative tomorrow to find something to go with the Tres Matres...",

Comes out to be the cheapest AC blade option when ordered directly from Japan, and gives a very good shave. More effective than the Feather Pro, and slightly less harsh. The Kai Captain Titan Mild is still my favorite, but ends up costing a lot more than either the Proline or the Feather Pro, so I can see the Proline becoming standard in my AC setup.\n* Speaking of which, it's tempting for me to just go all AC. The AC shaves are quicker than DE (by like a minute or so, but still...), have zero drama, and every AC blade I've used can go for ten great quality shaves with no issue. DEs by comparison are more variable, but therein lies the appeal, as the interplay of different razors and blades fascinate me, and that mix and match is generally absent from my AC world.\n* I have two decent AC razors and four different blades I can use, all of which perform in a very similar way. By comparison, I have maybe a dozen different DE razors, and 8-10 blades I use in them, most of which are far more idiosyncratic and varied in performance.\n* The AC is technically a better and more consistently reliable shave, like a Toyota or Honda. DE is more of a roller coaster, but the highs and lows have a certain inherent drama that I find appealing. I guess this is why I still buy American cars too!\n* **Soap**: In keeping with the back of the closet theme... A great scent in a fine base that I have neglected recently in favor of the fancier WK bases with buffalo DNA, vibranium, palladium, adamantium etc. The original tallow was supplemented with donkey milk in this base, and the result is a great shave, easily the finest performing three year old soap I have in my roster. I should pay more attention to his highly usable \"classic\"!\n* **Frag**: Fascinating effort to make a fougere using none of the traditional base notes. Ends up smelling like the interior of the nicest Indian restaurant imaginable, one of Ellena's greats, though some think it smells like B.O. Peons! ( :-D",

(Spoiler alert: is winning even an option?) After enjoying that, I had her blind smell each of my 8 SW soap samples and try to guess which one it was (her record was about 50-50). After it was all said and done, two things were certain: the wife had olfactory overload, and she loves VOA.\n\nWho's got two thumbs, and is snagging a full VOA set this weekend? This guy...",

There are probably some soaps in my drawer that are dustier (THB Decadence I don't think I've used since last year's Lather Games) but this is the dustiest one that spoke to me. The scent is spicy and pleasant, though I don't think I'd wear this as a full-strength fragrance. I believe we'll be seeing this one again next month.\n\nOh, and I'm absolutely loving the Flat Bottom Tech. Great blend of smoothness and efficiency.",

I realized the other day when rummaging through a drawer that I haven't used GTB in a while, but I had a couple new things I wanted to try first, so it worked out for today (disclaimer: it totally worked out this way by accident). GTB is a classic and needs to be used more. The Chiseled Face soap and splash are up there with the best values in wetshaving in my opinion.\n\nAlso, new brush! Never used a Jefferson before, and it's by far the thinnest brush i've ever used. Might take a little getting used to. Excellent craftsmanship (duh).",

Astra Green has been great so far - if I come up with a random sharpness feeling scale (1-10) this would be 4. or 3. One thing I am noticing a lot with these blades (that I didn't like previously) is that the impact of a shower is huge. I can really see/feel how soft my beard becomes after a shower. imo, no amount of prep can replace a good shower for a great shave.\n\nMaggard SHD - I am enjoying it quite a bit. I wish the handle had an 18-20mm hole. If you plan to get a 26mm Maggard SHD fan, I recommend you set it really low - something like 45-48mm overall loft. Nonetheless, it is a great brush.",

WTG, XTG, and ATG clean ups. What an amazing shave! I didn't know changing up the blade could make that much of a difference. The first shave with the Voshkod blade was a mile away from the 9th shave blade. The soap felt better with the fresh blade and post shave setup was nice and chilling.\n\n**The Soap** worked well. It still didn't outperform my expectations but it did meet my expectations. It lathered up easy and made a creamy lather. It was slick enough for the shave and it didn't dry out my skin. I can't ask for more, especially with the great value price that they got. TASS soaps will be a regular in my rotation because they're simple, easy, and good soaps.\n\n**The Razor and Blade** combination worked well. The Voshkod blade was smooth, sharp, and efficient. It was all that I could ask for in a blade. Now the question is when does the Voshkod start becoming dull? I can look back in my past shaves but I feel that after 4-5 shaves, the blade becomes less efficient. Regardless, now I know that Voshkod blades are actually good but later shaves are inefficient compared to the first ones. The razor was fine as always.\n\n**The Brush** felt great. What a brush. Nice and plushy but still felt a bit of the scritch. It feels like a soft broom with couple tips that are not broken in. It lathers up well and I'm still enjoying it as I use it. I can't wait to lather more with it!\n\n**The aftershave portion** was great. Awesome post shave. The MITA WH felt great on the skin as it chilled the heck out of my face. I put double portion and boy was it nice. The Executive man balm sealed the deal and my face was well moisturized throughout the whole day.\n\nOverall, an awesome shave. It was very close to a BBS but I did have couple weepers. It barely bled because the WH tightened up the skin without drying it. Finally, I'll be able to not shave for couple days. I'll be back for sunday shave though. I'm thinking of using Maggard synthetic with some other common soap. Maybe Williams.",

According to the A&E website it's the most popular soap within The Club. The scent is described as a bright bergamot and veviter opening followed by leather, geranium and the freshness of lavender with the earthiness of patchouli. My nose isn't that advanced, but I do get a bright opening and I can also notice the freshness of lavender. Overall a perfumy and very nice scent in my opinion. I definitely prefer this one to A&E Platinum. I was already familiar with the performance of A&E soaps since I own 5 of them now, elite level soaps in my opinion with the post-shave feel being the true star.",

      "body": "**Soap:** Oglalla Bay Rum & Limes, then WCS Oriental Cream [Catie's Bubbles base]\n\n**Brush:** TDR 26mm Fanchurian\n\n**Razor:** Holy Black SR-71\n\n**Blade:** Feather [3]\n\nThrew out my first soap today - I really don't like Oglalla. It was my second attempt at using it and while it smells great, I couldn't get the soap dialed for the life of me. Tried 2-3 times and finally got a passable lather. By my second pass it was already beginning to dry out. I ditched it and ran my third pass with CB. Christ, what a fantastic base. Whipped up in no time flat, and redeemed an otherwise dismal shave on its first pass.\n\nThe good news is that tossing the Oglalla soap freed up a shave stick container for me to press a soap in for portability. I tried getting the WCS in there and quickly learned that shave sticks combined with creams are an awful idea.\n\nI stuffed it with some Stirling Orange Chill. It was an a-ha moment considering my question yesterday about getting a good shave at the gym without lugging too much kit around. Orange Chill is going to feel incredible after a sauna session especially with the warm weather approaching. Will load up in no time with a synthetic brush, and my gym's two blade Gillettes should do a perfectly adequate job!\n\nHave a great day gang!",

Song would've made much more sense on Sunday. It's an alternative type hip hop track produced by Trent Reznor. The whole album is produced by Reznor, and it shows.\n\nYesterday might have been the hottest day of the year yet here, and it made me want to bust out something refreshing and delicious and cool. I have a few Stirling sample pucks that I've had for just sitting in the corner of a drawer for a while now and went with this. Same typical solid Stirling shave as usual. Since it's just a sample puck I don't have a matching splash, so I went with something else I barely ever use, but kinda matches pretty decently for some grocery store doodoo.",

I can safely say I need practice. I bloomed it for a few minutes, loaded for 15 seconds, and it took a lot of time in a separate bowl to work that up to a consistency I expected. Right about at that point, the lather was starting to take form but still was losing the fight against gravity, I dropped some sizable globs from my face, landing on my counter, myself, the sink... It probably took more than 5 minutes to get it dialed in. Maybe I need to play with it more, but it's hard for me to tell a difference between it and the YRP from yesterday. I had enough for 3+ passes, and the aftershave was nice. Again, hard for me to tell a difference between the new formula and the old. Maybe it comes down to long term use?\n\nLife is short, shave with good gear.",

High near 51. South wind around 10 mph. Chance of precipitation is 80%. New rainfall amounts between a tenth and quarter of an inch, except higher amounts possible in thunderstorms. High tide at 4:20 this afternoon.\n\n**Razor/Blade:** Cheeks are easy with the shavette, but the neck and under my chin are still difficult. Just getting the angle down so it doesn't feel tuggy. But if I go too far the other way it's not cutting. This whole thing takes a lot more effort that I initially thought. Did my clean-up passes with the Timeless, which I haven't used in a spell. It also reminded me of how effortless shaving with it is. So smooth and intuitive.\n\n**Soap/Splash:** Wanted something citrusy, but with the weather also wanted something that was a little bit darker. Kyoto hit the nail on the head. Produces a nice lather. Slick and cushioney. This is label is probably my second favorite artwork, coming just behind Dr. Jon's Flowers in the Dark.\n\nLast day of main job before vacation. Vacation Mode was engaged on Wednesday, luckily it's been slow, so it hasn't impacted the department much, if at all. Don't have much planned. Working the second job Monday and Tuesday of next week, then probably going to spend the other three days spring cleaning.\n\nHave a nice Friday everyone!",

Much closer than my usual results!\n\n#### ❧ Soap Notes\n*^(Cold River Soap Works - Schapenmelk)*\n\nScent: Light scent, similar to MWF, but I like it a little better.\n\nScent Strength: 2-3/10, very lightly present during shaving.\n\nLather was superb: creamy, slick, and very protective.\n\n33 second load with lightly-wet badger brush + 5 tsp water = 5-6 passes of lather.\n\nBowl - I used the XL version of this bowl:\nhttps://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3392930\n\n#### ❧ Brush Notes\n*^(Stirling - Finest in CravingShaving Blue Slate 26mm‹3 uses›)*\n\nThis guy is kinda reluctant to splay at first.

But I'll wait and see how the knot feels after a dozen uses or so.\n\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: A little irritating\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Cut flush to where I just see the tips (above average for me)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm)\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

I love the weight but it's a little different approach than I'm used to. The open comb wasn't too aggressive and gave a smooth shave. A little bit of irritation on my neck (I have sensitive skin) but I think it's likely more my technique to blame.\n\nLike all Stirling soaps, performance is great. I like the Bay Rum scent as something different. For me it's not an everyday scent though. However I think the spice of the Bay Rum compliments the Creed Spice & Wood.\n\nHappy Friday y'all!",

I received the (new to me) Leresche open comb razor in the mail yesterday and could not wait to use it as I have been interested in one for some time. I'm not exactly sure which model it is, but, it has a hollow handle and the Leresche logo in the block or bubble letters (not the Standard Leresche logo I have seen ). I believe it is one of the lesser tier models as it's Bakelite box is unlined and very thin in profile. Whatever model it may be, it produced a great shave. It got closer than my long handled Mercur, and felt smoother (open combs are my favorite) on the face with more audible feedback and less effort. I also really like razors with light and thin heads. This Makes trimming around my stasche and sideburns much easier I have found. All in all, I am really looking forward to using this in the future, and may have found my new daily driver! Hope everyone is having a great day and good shaves!",

I quite like the menthol kick in the AS as well, it's not overpowering but gives a nice cooling effect. The scent is one of my favorites and I have a couple Aventus dupes in my current rotation. The fragrance pairs nicely with Sellout as well for the lasting scent.",

It's described as a floral accord with citrus top notes and a petrichor base. It's a well-blended fragrance where I can't pick out any individual notes, but I can confidently say that the combination of sweet notes (almond, ginger, grapefruit, octanol, peach) and floral notes (calla lily, cotton flower, lavender) makes for a really lovely, bright, energetic, almost sugary sweet fruity-floral fragrance. I like it a lot. It's the strongest of the six SW soap scents I've tried but the fragrance still disappeared almost immediately post-shave like most of their soaps. It never hung around long enough for me to distinguish the petrichor and earth notes, so if they were there they were supporting the rest from below.\n\nMy final judgement? SW soaps perform like a monster - as many have said, it's a great soap, not just \"great for vegan.\" I love them from a shaving standpoint. For teh smellz, I found Alchemist gross; Cedar, Sandalwood, Druantia, and Lycanthropy all smell nice but they're pretty mild; and Tres Matres is one of the only floral products I've smelled that made me go [\"aww yiss.\"](http://www.harkavagrant.com/index.php?id=125) Druantia, Lycanthropy, and Tres Matres are all good enough that I would sample the Eau de Parfums if they weren't on the far side of an international border.\n\nFirst time trying out a 7 o'Clock of any variety. During the shave I thought, \"this doesn't feel any better than an Astra or Lord Platinum,\" but post-shave I notice zero irritation, zero weepers, zero missed whiskers or rough patches... and I didn't bother to do any touch-up today, so either I got lucky with my shave or this Gillette blade did a better job of efficiently removing hairs from my face than my other go-to blades. So: nothing-special face-feel for a first shave, but very good results. Promising.\n\nApH Summer 2015 is basically a lighter / simplified ApH with a lot of the spices stripped down for summer heat and a really enticing somewhat-gourmand citrus top. (I thought the initial citrus blast would be a nice follow-up to the Tres Matres, but TM was gone so quickly that I really could have gone with anything). Really tasty opening, nice woody heart right now, and I guess I'll see what the base smells like later. Definitely a good half-blind buy and a nice alternative to the rather heavy ApH that I can wear through the summer. Thumbs up.",

While I had a very good shave this time, I can understand why I hated it. I am seeing a clear pattern - I used to hate most blades that weren't perceived as Feather sharp. Just the little bit of resistance these blades provide (compared to say Feather, Kai etc.) is what made me dislike it. Not like these are actual bad blades/incapable of removing my beard.\n\nI guess that is why some experienced shavers can get 30 or even 100 shaves with a blade - the blade still remains usable; they might actually be better for skin after a few shaves. You just have to ignore that feeling of less sharp. Almost same as straight razors - I bet most newbies will prefer laser sharp synthetic edges over mellowed natural stone edges. Technique and patience lead to different taste.\n\nAll these being said, still, my preference is for the sharper feeling blades - during most days. So I would say, I prefer Chinese apache personna over this personna lab blue.\n\nFine is one of the few soaps regarding which I disagree with Ruds-score. I understand that it is easy to get a sub-par but good looking lather with this. But with lots of soap and even more water, this lather turns into a very slick one. Yes, the post shave is a bit drying, but still. Very good soap, imo.",

Hence the tupperware in the photo. I was able to reuse the label at least!\n\nThe scent is 100% marzipan to me. Very festive, but a bit too sweet for my taste. It's not a particularly heavily scented soap though so I had free reign of which AS to use. Performance for me was pretty good but not superb. It's one of the hardest soaps I've used in quite a while so it took much more loading than the SW or CF samples I've been frequenting recently.\n\nIt was a great shave overall, BBS on quite a few parts of my neck which is very unusual for me.\n\nHave a great weekend all!",

This was my first time using this blade and I switched it after 3 swipes. My head deserves better than to shave with anything less than GSBs.",

There is a reason that it was my daily driver for the better part of the year. Got a better shave out of the shavette this morning.

Borrowed some Stirling Blu from my buddy to try it out. Nice and fruity and aquatic with sweet melon and orange notes and a hint of basil and cucumber. The heart and base notes didn't really come out before I rinsed my face and they didn't stick around long enough for me to notice them. It smells a lot like Dunshire, which I also enjoy a lot, but I think Blu might be a little closer to my taste. I'll pick up an aftershave sample of Blu and see what it does... This might be a set I need to get for myself.\n\nThe 7 o'Clock was very nice until I thought, \"hmm, I need a little touch-up on my neck\" and proceeded to slice myself real good. Oops. Excellent shave otherwise today though!",

It's not. It just reminded me of when I disliked shaving. I hated that I just wanted it to be done.\n\nI loved Mayflower though. Not overly floral and it makes for a great spring scent.",

Better shaves comin down the pipeline. Happy Saturday everyone!",

I was surprised by the weight of the razor. It's quite heavy. The blade gap appears even and the twist function has good resistance. I'm playing with the settings and level 5 seemed to give a very nice shave. It has a hollow scraping sound like buttering toast which I like. It's on the aggressive side I like the razor very much. I'm looking forward to trying some other blades and settings.\n\nI also got an Omega boar from Shave HQ. I started to break it in by first lathering up some will fat. I then did the two day cold water soak method. After 24 hours I rubbed it on a towel for ten minutes. I then applied some cleansing conditioner that has no silicones or parabins for ten minutes. It's starting to soften up and splay out.\n\nOff to school today to master the Marcel curling iron. Looking forward to the Valley of Ashes drop in a couple hours.",

Went with the Astra, and some combination of blade + water hardness causing a bad lather gave me some irritation. The balm should take care of it! Now off to a day on the town in Chicago. Happy Saturday shaves!",

THB is not my favorite soap base. Secondary slickness and post-shave feel (which, b-t-dubs, is an imaginary metric) are both lacking. But, as with 99% of artisan soaps available these days, it's more than sufficient to get the job done and it beats the snot out of canned goo. I bought Tangerine Creeper for exactly two reasons: scent and synthetic cooling... and it totally delivers on both of those. My cranium is BBS and continuing to experience a pleasant chill 30 minutes after I cleaned and dried my razor.\n\nAlso, Eau de Treget has a nice peach note that I hadn't picked up on previously. It's a scent that keeps on giving. Go get your Ashes, people!",

First time shaving two days in a row, not sure if I enjoy it as much as my usual every other day. Only two passes because I didn't want to push my skin. I have to say, I think I get a better lather from natural hair brushes. I think its likely due to my lack of use/liking of synths, but it seems my natural hair lathers come much easier. I just don't enjoy a brush that has no water retention whatsoever.\n\nAnyways, I hope y'all enjoy your weekend!",

Maybe there's a blade that becomes my new favorite. Over the last few weeks I've given these Lords a chance and I really like them. Not quite as good as Astras or Gillette platinums, but still much better than any of the others in the sample pack. I think a box of 10 blades was like $0.88, so they're quite inexpensive too.",

Other blades do work smoother for me in this razor than the Bolzano. But I got a very close shave. And I get to return to a crazy good, and crazy old, traditional soap classic.\n\n#### ❧ Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Timeless - Bronze .38 Solid Bar ::: Balzano ‹3 uses›)*\n\nFairly good shave from these two. A little rough in a couple of spots, causing a little bit of irritation. But it wouldn't last long, and by balm-time it was gone.\n\nWonder if this blade will have a sweet spot when it smooths out with use.\n\n#### ❧ Soap Notes\n*^(Mitchell's Wool Fat - Hard Soap)*\n\nScent: light linen/laundry type of scent. I like it. Feels classic, warm, and cozy.\n\nScent Strength: 4/10, lightly present during shaving.\n\nI played it safe on this lather and stopped a bit early with the water. So my first pass was a little thick and didn't bond as well as I would have liked. Added more water and the 2nd and 3rd passes were phenomenal. This soap does like to get to that really elastic state, which I show off near the end of the vid.\n\n40 second load with lightly-wet, small, soft, boar brush + 4ish tsp (rough est.) water = 6 passes of lather.\n\nBowl - I used the XL version of this bowl:\nhttps://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3392930\n\n#### ❧ Brush Notes\n*^(Semogue - 1250 Boar‹14 uses›)*\n\nLove this little guy. Comfy and soft. But no problem whipping up a lather from this hard puck.\n\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: A little irritating\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Cut flush to where I just see the tips (above average for me)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm)\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

I noticed that one of the tires was low on air and filled it up on the way to the Zoo. After a long day of seeing animals and leaning about conservation we got back in the car and the tire PSI was down to 24. I found the nearest tire shop that was open and as suspected we had a nail in the tire.\n\nI think I probably picked up the nail yesterday following the \"shortcut\" provided by google. My other tires were nearing replacement anyhow so it wasn't the end of the world, but it was unplanned for. We finished up the day with dinner at Old Spaghetti Factory and then a beach bonfire and s'mores.\n\nSpaghetti Factory was my fathers favorite restaurant and one of the last places I ate at with him before I saw him for the last time. Going there always brings back memories. After we got to the cabin I made a fire, drank a couple of Shiners and roasted marshmallows with my family.\n\nRobot",

I didn't own a vintage Gillette, but now I have a 70s Super Speed, courtesy of u/fuckchalzone. Thanks for the A+ service!\n\nShaving with the Super Speed today it certainly lived up to its name. The combination of its light weight and its mildness meant it flew across my face. No muss, fuss or drama. I think the light weight and ease of use of it will make it a great travel razor for me.\n\nHope you're all having a good weekend.",

Trying out Castle Forbes for first time. I over-watered it. So it was nothing to brag about. And tried the Balzano in a mild razor, like this Tech.\n\n#### ❧ Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Gillette - Tech Fat Handle - Pre-war ::: Balzano ‹4 uses›)*\n\nNot all that comfy today. Even in such a mild razor, this blade, while cutting close, did stir up some razor burn. I really wonder if putting more uses on it will get it into a better zone.\n\n#### ❧ Soap Notes\n*^(Castle Forbes Cream - 1445)*\n\nThem: \"Notes of fern and grasses are supported by lavender, tarragon, lemon, and bitter orange. Fresh, green, and natural.\"\n\nScent: I was able to pick up most of the scent notes there. Kind of interesting, and I really wouldn't mind shaving with it if I had to, but first impression was that it was a little too disjointed for me. Especially with so many other options available.\n\nScent Strength: 4-5/10, lightly present during shaving.\n\nI over-watered this one, but that gave me a chance to see how it would act. It held together just fine and delivered a good shave with nice glide. But it was nowhere near creamy.\n\n2/3 of a 1/4 tsp measure of soap + lightly-wet big badger brush + 5 tsp water = 3.5 passes of lather.\n\nBowl - I used the XL version of this bowl:\nhttps://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3392930\n\n#### ❧ Brush Notes\n*^(Elite Razor - Manchurian Fan CravingShaving Blue/White 26mm‹4 uses›)*\n\nSeemed to have more backbone at first, with tips that weren't super soft. I may soak this brush for longer before a shave. Like my TDR Fanchurian, it may really need it to be able to start out with the softness I ended up with. We'll see.\n\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: A little irritating\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Cut flush to where I just see the tips (above average for me)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm)\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

Took my time, did three passes, about 90% completely smooth. Did a little touch-up under the chin and under the nose. Both those spots had hair that was tough to cut. I wished my Mom a happy Mother's Day, but feel a little bad I didn't send overpriced flowers or even a card her way. I tend to forget about the card until it's too late, maybe I'll send one tomorrow. I know she won't hold it against me, she's always made a point to not get her anything.\n\nIn other news, my wife asked me point blank if she can give in her two-weeks to her employer. It's a tough call because she enjoys her job and is very, very good at it, plus gets to work from home. It came to a head last Friday, and without getting too deep, essentially they've asked her to switch positions to fill in a temporary hole in another departments. Completely different, and leaving her own team short-handed. This is the fourth time in two years she's had to do something like this. There are other reasons too but this is the proverbial straw that broke the camel's back. I've supported her all the way but before we go this far, I told her to give them an ultimatum and if she doesn't get her two demands then give them her two-weeks.\n\nLife is short, shave with good gear.",

I had 2 days of growth so seemed like a good opp, since I remembered telling myself it was too aggressive for daily shaving.\n\nThis thing is quite efficient and aggressive. No cuts weepers etc, but the blade feel is definitely there, and there's a bit of drag as a result. I've been enjoying these types of razors lately, but it takes a certain mindset. It's not gonna be a mindlessly smooth shave.\n\nBut I absolutely cannot argue with the results! BBS for hours after a 2 pass shave (WTG/ATG). Of course there's always a little cleanup on my neck where the hair growth is odd. Rarely did I go over a spot more than once or twice.",

I normally like to stick with sets when I shave, but given I haven't picked up the AS for After the Rain I wanted to give this a spin.\n\nThe scents work together very well. The AtR adds depth to the Cool splash. Nothing that overpowers the wonderful workings of the Cool, but adding a layer that keeps the nose interested for longer than normal. By dry down, the hints of AtR were all gone, but this combo is completely worth using again.\n\nHappy Mother's Day and Happy Sunday!",

WTG, XTG, and ATG clean ups. Wow, just wow. The Gillette Old Type is one of the most efficient razors of all times. It's aggressive but not to the point of bleeding out. Brush was amazing and the soap did a fine job. It was very thirsty soap so it took tons of water.\n\n**The Soap** worked well. It took drips of water after water after water after.... ya get it. It took me a couple minute to dial in the water but after that, it was creamy as ever. Great lathering process and I really enjoy it for what it is. The soap was protective and slick. Even with the aggressive setup, my face turned out fine with minor irritation.\n\n**The Razor and Blade** combination worked well. I keep coming to the Old Type because it is so darn efficient. The trade off is that it's a lot easier to get irritation, especially around my chin/neck area. However, as long as I don't overbuff the areas, my shave is good to go. The blade was doing fine and I think I'll continue to use that and test its longevity.\n\n**The Brush** felt great. A neat little brush. It's one of the smallest Semogue's out there but it performs well. It's still got a bit of a scritch to it which I enjoy. And it holds good amount of lather, enough for multiple passes. Overall, I really enjoy this little fella and I can't wait to use it more. Also, it's looking to bloom a lot bigger so I love that feature.\n\n**The aftershave portion** was great. The Alum stung a bit today but I expected that with the aggressive setup. Still, no nicks or weepers so that's a plus. With the Ice cold balm, I chilled my face and it was good to go for the rest of the day.\n\nOverall, an awesome shave. It was pretty much a BBS shave without needing that extra clean up pass. By the second pass, most of my stubbles were gone. I'll reserve the Old Type for a heavier growth and I definitely don't want this as my daily driver. I'll continue with a milder razor and Miami Mojito soap for tomorrow.",

I had pretty much used electric all my life with a few years of multi-blade cartridges thrown in.\n\n\nI honestly don't care for the blades. They're good for maybe one shave, sometimes two, and I get lots of nicks. I'm glad I only have 2 left.\n\n​\n\nAs far as the Every Man Jack stuff goes, I wasn't sure what to buy or where to buy it, but I had been using their soap so thought I'd give their stuff a try. It's not bad, I guess, but I want to try some of the other premium stuff. I ordered Margaritas in the Arctic shave soap and a sample of after shave splashes. I tried it one day and really liked it, but I have a few more days left of EMJ cream.\n\n​\n\nBTW, this is my first post here!",

I really enjoy this scent, particularly the vanilla that lingers subtly throughout the day.\n\nOne thing I've noticed, though, is that I get a slight reaction from the aftershave but not the soap, which is weird. Nothing unbearable, but I turn kinda red for like 20 mins or so and it tingles a bit. Other T+S aftershaves are fine, as is this soap with the same fragrance. I'll splash some more on later without shaving to see I'm crazy or not. I hope I'm crazy.",

A perfect day to test drive Dark 2. Off the puck, the scent reminds me of a peppermint pattie. Nice noticable mint and chocolate. I did resist the urge to lick the tub, but only barely.\n\nThe soap loaded out of the tub to a wet but not dripping synthetic brush very easily. Like the other T&S soaps I have used it face lathered easily, requiring water added frequently but in small amounts. I ended up with a slick cushiony lather that gave a good smooth shave.\n\nThe scent, excuse the pun, got darker as I shaved. The vetiver moved from the back to the mid and deepened the scent. The cocoa and peppermint stayed dominant through out the shave. I didn't pick up any of the coffee notes.\n\nPost shave left my face soft and hydrated. No irritation or nicks. I did have a slight warming sensation with the splash, but nothing unpleasant. Scent wise, the ginger was more apparent in the splash and added a touch of savory and bitter to balance out the sweetness.\n\nOverall a good BBS shave to start the week.\n\nHappy Monday!\n\nedit: On dry down, Dark II reminds me of Hallows with the cocoa and vetiver moving to the front.",

There's probably only an ounce left of this soap, I'd like to finish it by year's end. I was impatient for hot water but a cold water shave has worked for me in the past, so I turned to it again today. The shave was great especially considering it has only been 20 hours since the last. Felt smooth, but then when I was outside with the dog, I could feel stubble again. On the couch while writing this, I feel smooth again. Is that an effect of the mentholated aftershave and then wearing off, or the cold weather?\n\nLife is short, shave with good gear.",

Probably only a few more shaves left. I want it to die already! On a sort of related note, this is a very old tub. I notice in the proto-lather that there seem to be small hardish, almost sandy, granules. It dissipates in the actual lather loaded into the brush. Any idea what that is? Something likely caused by old soap separating. I worry a couple other of my older soaps may suffer from a common affliction.",

Not like gross nasty tobacco, the good stuff. Off the puck it sort of reminds me of old Sunkist grape [Fun Fruits](https://www.google.com/search?q=sunkist+fun+fruit).\n\nPaid a little more attention with this Gillette blade after slicing myself good last time. Excellent results. I think this is going to be an irritation-free day.",

And I try a new-to-me scent of Castle Forbes and try to reduce the water for a creamier mix.\n\n#### ❧ Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Wolfman - WR1 Solid Bar .54 Brushed ::: Bolzano ‹5 uses›)*\n\nBest use of the Bolzano yet. Fairly comfy. Just a bit of irritation on one spot of neck, but was gone by end of shave. Good cut, too.\n\n#### ❧ Soap Notes\n*^(Castle Forbes Cream - Cedarwood and Sandalwood)*\n\nScent: A generic woody scent, not much resembling what we Americans think of as cedar (but that was actually a plus for me), with a bit of a sweetness to it, and a hint of the sandalwood. I liked it.\n\nScent Strength: 4/10, lightly present during shaving.\n\nI may have over-watered this one, but I got it pretty darn close. Close enough to continue to be unimpressed. What I didn't know when I made the vid is that for the $40 you spend on this soap, you get 6.8 oz. So that's not as bad as I was thinking. However, to be honest, I'd rather lather up some Stirling and save a ton of money. The performance just didn't justify the cost, and this is no competitor to the top tier American croaps, and many of the 2nd tier as well, IMO.\n\n1/4 tsp soap + lightly-wet big badger brush + 3.5 tsp water = 4-5 passes of lather.\n\nBowl - I used the XL version of this bowl:\nhttps://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3392930\n\n#### ❧ Brush Notes\n*^(Stirling - Finest in CravingShaving Blue Slate 26mm‹4 uses›)*\n\nStill a bit stiff/backboney. Here's hoping it relaxes just a bit more.\n\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Cut flush to where I just see the tips (above average for me)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm)\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

Ocean Water eau de Parfum opens with fresh aqueous citrus notes that evolve into a sea salt & driftwood middle accord that's subtle and alluring.

Blade has plenty of life in it. Only issue with Proline was that it coughed out two blades at once when I worked the dispensing slide on the cartridge, hopefully will not be a consistent issue.\n* **Brush**: Another past master that has not aged well. SR was always a mushier alternative to Simpson Best, much softer face feel out of the box but with a structure closer to Kent than Simpson. The handle is very nicely done, kind of a mini keyhole, but whether it be the \"pure\" bulb shape, lack of hair density, or interior knot structure, my SR tends to be a very inefficient lather dispenser and a full minute of loading gets me only enough retained / dispensed soap for one pass.\n* Subsequent passes need extra loading, something that is not a dealbreaker for a $22 boar but much more problematic for a $135 \"premium\" badger.\n* Brush still looks good, the knot is in fine shape, the face feel is soft and cushy, but the efficiency is much worse than a $40 Stirling badger, or even a $15 synth. As a result, this guy is a backbencher.\n* **Soap / Frag**: The two B&M lavenders, one simple and the other fancy, work very well together! A fine spring combo .., just need some fine Spring weather to match.",

Stirling mountain man A/S. Stirling un-scented balm\n\nThe combination of the slant and the Permasharp is great for me. It was a very close yet comfortable shave and it positively mowed down my three day growth. And, I love the audible feedback from this razor.\n\nThe Mike's soap was better for me this time around than in previous uses. I decided it needed more water and I think this helped. It had a little more slickness and less post shave drying effect than before. It has a luxurious face feel, great cushion, and a nice scent as well. Not sure if it will unseat Stirling as my favorite soap though.\n\nHope everyone is having great shaves and a not so mondane Monday!",

Quite a bit of struggle lathering up today for some reason - the brush was floppy and the soap was stringy (something I didn't pay attention to on SBS soaps previously). I was surprised by this considering I've found SBS to lather very easily before. I'm going to check this out - the only difference this time was using the MLS pre-shave butter, which is quite oily.\n\nNonetheless, once lathered up, the lather was smooth and did not have any issue with a 3 pass shave. My skin is a mess after the sudden weather changes - got bumps/pimples all over but came out the shave unscathed. Skin felt very good with the application of the balm post-shave. This is my second AS balm from Stirling and I have to say, a little product goes a long way. Great stuff.\n\nThe Nacet blade feels great still. Just glides through lather and cuts without complaints.\n\nI had a few great shaves while on vacation last week. Gotta say the SOTD habit had me thinking about each shave so I had some notes down for each one. Might post them on my non-shave days this week.\n\nMy Monday feels awesome after the nail-biting, unbelievable Raptors win last night. The weather is garbage but I feel good. Have a nice Monday folks!",

I was giving a suggestion to a newbie about continuing to shave with Mach 3 while using traditional lather - I thought I should (re) do that myself and see. I used this mach 3 almost a year ago - during Maggard meetup.\n\nAll in all, shave went pretty well, in a scale of 1 to 100, if I give the Weber side a 95, I would give the Mach 3 side a solid 90 in terms of closeness. They were both equally comfortable, Mach 3 might be a bit more comfortable during ATG pass - but I don't know. But yes, carts (using proper technique) can give fantastic shaves.\n\nElectric sheep is arko on steroid. It comes with the following warning - \"WARNING: This soap is a blend of Lemon, Citronella, and Eucalyptus essential oils. It is not for the faint of heart. If you've never tried it, please buy a sample first.\" And yes, this isn't for everyone but I love it. ̄_(ツ)_/ ̄.\n\nEJ synthetic is for those who like synthetic but wants something different.",

I was surprised it came in so quick! I needed a shave today. I was all set to use Nefertiti again, and low and behold this was on porch when I can home from the gym.\n\nInitial impression: I bought Chiseled Face Stag a long time ago, I hated it. It smelled really really strong. I PIF'd it to a buddy of mine. So I was really sceptical when I read the scent notes on Valley of Ash prior to it's release. I was picturing it to be a Stag Lite.\n\nOff the tub, It's a light scent, but I definitely do pick up Stag. Motor oil, leather, diesel. It's there. It's not hiding anywhere. But I gave it a shot. Boy does this scent open up. I get still get leather, and motor oil, but I got a lot of spice. It's a complex scent, and I cant pick out any individual notes. But it's very well rounded. Its dirty, It's spicy, it's masculine.\n\nIt's really, really good.\n\nAlmost 30 minutes have passed and I'm getting whiffs of the EdP. The leather smell took a back seat, and I smell more of the bourbon, and tobacco notes.\n\nI enjoy this one immensely, and I'm so glad I picked it up. It draws a picture in my mind. Of working on an old factory vehicle line. Putting together these fancy cars for the rich folks, getting covered in motor oil, and grease. Going to bar after work with the boys, knocking back a few drinks, and finishing a pack of smokes. Only to do it all over again the next day, a slave to the grind.\n\nHope you all enjoy your day!",

WTG, XTG, and ATG clean ups. A mild shave but it was pretty efficient. Not the closest but not a lot of irritation. The brush worked well. I'm beginning to like 26mm brushes a lot. Soap was wonderful. Razors and blade was good and I had a mild post shave to end.\n\n**The Soap** worked really well. I was surprised and how quick I made a working lather. I loaded a bit wetter than usual so when I face lathered, the soap was dripping a bit onto my chest. However, after 20-30 sec or so, I had a wet looking creamy lather all across my face. I usually lather for + 3 min but this time was different. Also, I lathered for + 5 min yesterday with the DG Original so having this quick lather was surprising. I kind of missed the lathering and dialing in more water but quick shaves are beneficial for getting to work on time, haha.\n\n**The Razor and Blade** combination worked well. The blade was efficient but smooth enough. The razor felt like a Gillette Tech, very mild and no blade feel on the face. Still, it shaved fairly well. It is no Old Type but given it's mild nature, I really enjoyed it thoroughly.\n\n**The Brush** felt great. I'm really taking a liking to 26mm brushes. I thought it was a little too big at first but now, it seems like the perfect size. Similar to my Summer Storm Craving Shaving brush, this one lathered up quickly and felt great on the face. Soft plushy ball-like feel and it always holds enough lather for 5+ passes.\n\n**The aftershave portion** was great. Very mild post shave with the Witch Hazel and Stirling balm. It felt like something was missing without the menthol but I have to control myself during these times.\n\nOverall, a great shave. It started out really mild but it took most of my stubbles away. At the end, the ATG was a little rough but I went slower and that took care of the minor issue. I'm excited for this Thurs because I'll be receiving a Stirling Finest Badger Brush! The marble handle seems to be a rare one and I got a trade for it. I can't wait for more plushy badgers on my face! I'm thinking of using a commercial soap tomorrow with the Maggard synthetic.",

It did exactly what I asked of it.\n\nBased on how much I like the Super Speed I've started trawling European eBay for a Fatboy at a non ridiculous price. So far I've found a whole lot of Slims masquerading as Fatboys and a whole lot of big prices. The search is part of the fun though, right?\n\nThis is the first CB soap that I've tried. Performance was just as good as I expected and I love the scent. There's something deeply comforting about the scent of if. So much so that I ordered a full tub right away, and a bottle of CL's Unconditional Surrender toner to go with it.\n\nI don't see A Midnight Dreary on CB's website, although it's in stock at Maggard's. Has it been discontinued or something?\n\nHappy Tuesday all!",

Off the puck I felt like I sensed some floral notes, but still can't pin down the rest. All I smell at the moment is Mayflower, so there ends my guessing game, at least for now. I love the way my skin feels after the aftershave. It's easy to compare from yesterday when I used Stirling AS and balm, and you really can tell a difference in post-feel.\n\nLife is short, shave with good gear.",

The blade before it had issues with it and I was only able to get 2 shaves with it. Either I'm damaging the blade after placing it in, or there is some inconsistency with how they are manufactured because I'm not as confident with these blades as I once was.\n\nI'm considering switching to astras once I'm done with these blades or will buy a new sampler pack.",

Got me thinking about one of my favorites. You can buy this soap at most large grocery stores in France for about €1.25. Yields a great lather. Only downside is the dryness after the shave. But I always put on some sort of product afterwards so it never bothers me anyway.\n\nIn my experience one can indeed see a clear distinction between the best artisans and Big Soap. But the gap isn't quite as wide as some would have you believe. So if you can't or aren't interested in spending as much for an artisan, just remember there are still perfectly good options out there for very fair prices. What I've learned most from this sub is how much technique matters. It's not the wand; it's the magician.\n\nHappy shaving.",

This is one of my favourite bases and it did not disappoint. No issues with water and I just love this brush - it feels better (soft but a little more backbaone) compared to the floppy fan shape knot. This one also doesn't shed too much too.\n\nThe Carib was a great post-shave experience especially using it by the beach. Smooth and light tasting. Felt cold to the touch. It helped keep me feeling good throughout my time on the beach.\n\nHave a good Tuesday!",

The Proline looked fine when I swapped it over from the General, and shaved just as fine as well. I can't really decide which AC razor I prefer - General vs Calypso - as they are both fine performers - efficient with mild blade feel - that can give me a quick (12 min) two pass BBS.\n* **Brush**: A \"homage\" to the vintage Rubberset 400 handles, RR no longer makes this particular brush as they changed all their badger sourcing over to the flavor du jour, two bands. A pity, as this is a nice knot - a poor man's Shavemac D01, offering soft face feel and moderate to high backbone. Has a mushroom cloud bloom, which I have mixed feelings on, but generally gives a pleasant and efficient shave.\n* **Soap**: Wholly Kaw's most polarizing scent - I like it quite a bit, and it works nicely on yet another wintry, rainy \"Spring\" morning here. Performance is excellent, and the dirty, pungent leather scent is a nice kick in the nose, and one that goes well with the sweeter yet also quite dark Civet.",

I am also still working through a box of Personna Blues that it seems has lasted somewhere in the neighborhood of 30 years at this point (okay, maybe 2 years). I usually only use them for one or two head shaves but it still seems like a bottomless box. Anyhow, Stubble Buster soaps are so easy to use. They are easy to lather, good (not excellent, but really good) quality and the most bang for your buck in wet shaving. And this MR7/V3 Maggard Razor is still one of my favorite razors to use. I have many more expensive razors, but this is still the one that gets the most use.",

I think my sweet spot is WTG XTG XTG to avoid irritation on my neck. I have some GSBs and Voskhods coming in bulk later this week. Looking over notes I had taken I realized I had the GSB rated slightly over Polisilver and couldn't decide between the two. Wont need blades for a few years now haha.\n\nThis soap has quickly become one of my favorites. The base is easy to work with and has an excellent post shave feel. I enjoy the menthol kick in the AS, gives good feedback and a nice cooling effect for a few minutes. Might have to go back to some Stirling samples that aren't getting much love for the PIF on Thursday if I wake up in time to shave.",

      "body": "**2019-05-14 Stirling Sample SOTD**\n\n**Prep:** Took a warm shower, shaved with cool water\n\n**Razor:** 1955 Ball-end Tech\n\n**Blade:** Gillette 7 o'Clock Yellow / SharpEdge (shave #4)\n\n**Brush:** Yaqi 24mm Moka Express (Synthetic)\n\n**Lather:** Stirling Mountain Man\n\n**Post:** Stirling Mountain Man Aftershave Splash & Unscented Post-Shave Balm\n\n**Fragrance:** l'Aventure Knight by Al Haramain (Green Irish Tweed inspired)\n\n**Thoughts:**\n\nMountain Man. Based on [Creed's Silver Mountain Water (1995)](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Creed/Silver-Mountain-Water-472.html). /u/CosmoBarber and /u/Bluesy21 asked, so here it is. What it's supposed to be made out of:\n\n- Orange & bergamot up top\n\n- Green tea & black currant heart\n\n- Musk, petitgrain, sandalwood, & galbanum base\n\nMy first impression of the soap was, \"this reminds me of Dunshire and Blu - sort of fruity, sort of aquatic.\" They all have citrus up top accompanied some sort of aquatic undertones: cucumber and melon in Blue, black currant in MM, and peach and salt water in Dunshire. Dunshire always gives me a bit of a \"peach snapple\" vibe, MM has some green tea in it. Blu has basil, sage, and geranium for greenery, MM has green tea, galbanum, and petitgrain. There's a lot of crossover between the three. If you're just buying soap, they're all good... you wouldn't go wrong with any of them, but you probably only need one of them in your collection. Go with Dunshire if you like peach, Blu if you like melon, or Mountain Man if you like green tea and black currant.\n\nBut!\n\nThe aftershaves / colognes tell a different story once you get past the top notes of your soapy shaving experience. Dunshire transforms into a sweet, musky, mossy jasmine scent; Polo Blue turns into barbershoppy greens (sage, basil, geranium) and eventually to a pure suede drydown (I don't have a Blu sample to try, but I do have the real thing); and in Mountain Man the black currant and green notes come out much more prominently for a sort of fresh fruity, grassy smell. Edit: MM aftershave in its drydown almost has an effervescent soda-pop character to it, or at least that's what it's reminding me of. Maybe a hint of cream soda?\n\nSpeaking of green tea: l'Aventure Knight. Green Irish Tweed with a tart green tea opening. Fook me I love it. Excellent scent to chase the Mountain Man with.\n\nAnother very very nice shave from the yellow 7:00. This is a nice blade in this Tech.",

But this shave reminded me that the CG Lvl 2 is an aggressive razor that's not very forgiving.\n\nA razor id only recommend for 2+ days growth (personally), however I know a number of folks here like the aggression even for daily shaving. You could easily get by with one WTG or one XTG pass and have a DFS with it.\n\nToday was my second shave in a row (albeit with a 2 day gap) with the razor. I caught myself on the top lip and ended up with irritation on my neck. I didn't even feel like over shaved!\n\nRide the cap with this thing! I find the Lvl 1 and Lvl 1 Dual Comb to be great for 1-3 days growth if I'm being honest.",

I got the sample last week but hadn't shaved with it yet but I really liked the smell. It's a very dirty scent, not in a sexy Night Music kind of way more of a CFG Pine Tar way. The scent off the puck is strong with a synthetic burnt rubber and smokey ash smell. Reading the scent notes this shouldn't be something that smells this good but it does. The scent stays roughly the same in the lather but with a little more of the diesel and tar fume smells. Enough has been written about the SW base so I'll just leave it at, this is not only the best Vegan base that I've used but it's one of my favorite bases period. Oddly enough the aftershave has a quite different smell for me...it still has the smoky qualities but there is a subtle sweetness mixed in with more of the tar notes and less of the synthetic rubber fume notes.\n\nI know that this scent won't be for everybody but I love it, it's not something I'd wear to work but the SO likes it so it'll be a go to for a date night or a weekend wear. I can't wait to hear what everybody else thinks about it.",

WTG, XTG, and ATG clean up. I was a bit surprised at today's shave. I think the main issue was the soap here. It wasn't the foamy mess like before but it was not protective. It had the soapy slickness but it did not protect the face well. Brush was fine and the razor was fine. ATG was a bit rough but post shave did the job.\n\n**The Soap** worked okay. The WMSS did the job but poor at protecting the skin. The moment I started shaving, I thought I was shaving a leather. The razor scraped against the face and it did not give a good feedback. During ATG, the soap was drying on the skin and only slick enough to go through the shave. It's a tough decision with this soap. It actually lathers decently but it does not perform at all. I have to find a better combination with this soap as a mild setup does not work for me.\n\n**The Razor and Blade** combination worked okay. The razor was mild but the blade was tugging towards the end. I'm not sure if it was the soap or the blade but it felt a bit rough on the skin. It's only fourth use for the blade but I felt discomfort at the end. The superspeed doesn't seem to like the blade as it goes further. I'll try again and see if I want to replace the blade but for now, it still shaves.\n\n**The Brush** felt great. A redeeming feature of the shave. It performed excellently and it gave a better lather for the second and third pass. Felt soft on the skin and lathered up fine every pass. It has the least backbone out of my brushes but it performs well every time.\n\n**The aftershave portion** was great. The TJ's moisturizing gel was a surprise for me. It replaced their aloe vera gel and it actually does wonders for my skin. I used to use their aloe vera regularly and stopped because I ran out. This new formula adds glycerin and menthol. My skin feels a bit tight after putting it on but soothing as the day goes on. Great chilling feel with the ice cold balm.\n\nOverall, an okay shave. The soap disappointed me even though the lather was fine. The nature of this soap is that it dries out my skin and makes it easy to scrape the outer part. I'm gonna have to try out a Stirling tomorrow and compare it. I wonder if it's the combination of higher blade uses + soap. Anyhow, shave was done. For tomorrow, I'll use a Stirling soap with either a boar or a silvertip. Same razor/blade to experiment the differences.",

The scent is very coffee ish (as expected) although it's more latte than black coffee to me. It's very similar to Coffee Spoons from Storybook Soapworks. I don't know if it's a property of soap making or just the artisans choices but I haven't yet found a strong black coffee scent, Leviathan is the only thing that has come close but that has other notes too.\n\nI didn't have much to pair with this so I went with Monarch as it has some things that complement nicely, the richer notes in that work well with the V60.\n\nI also discovered I'm out of ground coffee with a baby asleep so I've raided the cold brew in the fridge. No paired coffee pour over today, maybe next time!",

Oddly enough this one also reminded me of laundry detergent a little, but not in the same comforting way as the orchid notes from A Midnight Dreary. There were no particularly pronounced notes for me - nothing really jumped out at me. I think it might be a bit too mild and inoffensive for me. The moderate amount of citrus from it it was a bit of a tease so I followed it up with a bigger citrus hit from Fern Concerto.\n\nPerformance was top notch though, and a little soap goes a long way. I'm back on the OC and while I have to think about it a little more than the Super Speed, it gives a closer shave at the end of it.\n\nHappy 🐪 day all!",

I remembered to bloom the soap, and with a very wet brush, loaded about 100 swirls. Face lathered and added water three times. It came together easier but I lost some soap in the loading process. I had enough for 3 passes although I only did two. About half-way through my final pass, the dog barged in and as common courtesy to the sleeping wife, I shut the light off, completing the pass in the dark while the dog grabbed all my sleep clothes in his excitement. After I rinsed and dried my hand, I acknowledged him and his goodness, and he left so I could clean up in the light again.\n\nLife is short, shave with good gear.",

I was hesitant to commit to this soap on a blind buy because I thought it would be smoky and a bit too funky for me. I am super impressed by it however. I don't know how he did it but /u/hawns absolutely nailed the jazz club vibe. The scent is sweet and smoky, funky, smooth and refined all at the same time. Very cool! Really enjoyed the shave today.",

Lathering took a little bit longer with the stiff bristles of this brush but I did enjoy the little face massage.\n\nThe razor and blade are working together very well for me. The Nacet doesn't struggle with its job, 15 shaves in. I'm starting to get really comfortable with this combo.\n\nThe AS balm is great however, it smells nothing like the soap or like anything really. I had not noticed this earlier - maybe this is a mistake on the label and it's an unscented balm. I am a little disappointed since I really enjoy the scent.\n\nHappy hump day folks.",

Also, Black Ship's base is one of my lower performing soaps I have...but it's still definitely usable. I don't know, I just never seem to get the loading / wetness level down. It always seems to end up airy and sort of dry. I do believe that I may have messed this soap up, since it was my first soft artisan soap I acquired (it's sold at a small shop near me, and that's how I first found it.) I had it in my overnight bag in my car one day in some hot ass temps, and it turned to straight mud for a few days. But damn the BS aftershave splashes smell fantastic and really have a legit alcohol hit to them. Tasty.\n\nPGA Championship starts tomorrow, and i've been doing pretty shitty in DFS this season.

I'll start by saying that my sample had been sitting in a little ziplock for a while so it possible I've lost a little scent strength. Initially it just smelled soapy to me. When lathering it sweetened up a bit with a fruity scent to it and was very mild.\n\nI also went back and used the West Egg AS after u/MadDingersYo and I got reminded to apply it with water. It's much better that way with minimal tackiness. It feels really nice.\n\nAqua gold is fantastic and I've gotten a few compliments from my lady friends. Top notes are lavender and citruses; middle notes are jasmine and orange blossom; base notes are cedar, leather and white musk.",

Cheapest and best AC blade I have used so far, though performance is generally quite similar between them all.\n* **Soap**: A rather mild and simple fougere, indeed I am not quite sure if the Eufros blend here even has anything besides the three base elements of a fougere composition (lavender, oakmoss, and coumarin). It's kind of like a well made book with all blank pages instead. Still a pleasant enough scent, and impressive technical performance from a top tier base. Not my favorite Eufros scent by any stretch, but still a pleasure to use.\n* **Frag:** One of the most powerful scents in my lineup, this is a fine Spring scent and the note of coffee makes it unusual.",

Ill be selling it in a big lot on the bazaar later this weekend, keep your eyes peeled.\n\nThis blade surprised me so much. Im not sure if it was because i had a shower or what, but this was the smoothest yet most efficient blade ive ever tried. Im very curious to keep using it.\n\nI soaked the SHD brush for a couple minutes and it was noticably softer/gellier, i think ill keep doing that\n\n1 final today, 2 tomorrow, then im done.

I've heard good things about the Fougere and was looking forward to trying the Barbershop. The packaged came with some pre-shave oil and if I am honest, I am distrustful anytime a I see a company market one. A soap itself should provide enough slickness in itself to meet the needs of a wetshave.\n\n​\n\nThe scent itself smelled very similar to Maggards or BSG Barbershops and I feel like it may be a pre-blend. The soap was medium-soft and provided alot of volume but low slickness. The star of the show was the Balm. My skin initially felt a little greasy, but within 5 mins or so, the grease sensation departed and I was left with a nice powdery scent and moisturized skin.",

The R41 gave me a DFS at two passes and a mostly BBS in three. But, man, it was rough. The feather blade was great the first shave, good the second, and not goodnon the third. I guess I will need to keep looking for the ideal blade for that razor.",

What a great shaver! It was efficient and so comfortable. I was even dealing with 30 hours of growth, and it was a delight to use. Second pass I used setting 2 and it was super smooth.\n\nSuch an efficient cutter, that with no change in my technique, I was done in 2 passes instead of 3!\n\n#### ❧ Soap Notes\n*^(Wholly Kaw Buffalo - Pasha's Pride)*\n\nThem: \"Leather, Tobacco, Oud, Lime, Grapefruit, Tangerine, Sandalwood, Spices\"\n\nScent: Leather is easy to pick up when dry and wet, but the citrus was more pronounced when in lather form. A masculine accord that I really like.\n\nScent Strength: 4/10, lightly present during shaving.\n\nThis is a low structure lather, staying kinda gluey in appearance, similar to the new bases of DG and BaM. Was very slick, felt great on the face, provided very nice razor glide, and I didn't really need any post-shave products after.\n\nThis one is an expensive soap, and does require the whole measure of the 1/4 tsp, so it is not a \"little goes a long way\" soap.\n\n1/4 tsp soap + lightly-wet boar brush + 2 tsp water = 4 passes of lather.\n\nBowl - I used the XL version of this bowl:\nhttps://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3392930\n\n#### ❧ Brush Notes\n*^(Semogue - 1305 Boar‹14 uses›)*\n\nNot many of the tips have split (seemingly) on this guy, but he's still enjoyable to use. Very comfy. Medium to med-light backbone, to me.\n\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Smooth\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Cut flush to where I just see the tips (above average for me)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm)\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

That means we're halfway to the Lather Games. You've got two weeks to spend quality time with your favorites that don't match the themes. Granted, there are at least 3 days when Seville in Reserve fits (Barbershop, Sub Exclusive, and People's Choice). But I'm going for points this year, which means my only use of B&M will be on People's Choice day and I haven't entirely settled on which B&M I'll be using.\n\nAt any rate, had a great shave with the Seville in Reserve this morning. As always, the Karve razor just mows down multiple days worth of growth effortlessly and lathering up with the gel-tastic B6 is just a pleasure.",

What a lovely thing - my skin and beard came out much softer from it. 42 is a scent that I usually wouldn't use on a work day as it's a somewhat weird, complex combination of scent notes, but no internal or external meetings today allowed me to use something a little different than the tame Reserve scents I usually employ.\n\nI almost took today as my first opportunity to use a very generously PIF'ed badger brush from one member of the community (via *another* member of this community), but was running short on time and stuck with my trusty synthetic. I'll show the brush and give a shout out to those generous guys when I have my first SOTD with it, but in the meantime, a question.... do you guys soak your badger brushes prior to shaving?\n\nHappy Wednesday shaves, all!",

I love everything about these soaps except the price, but even at that I can always have a place in my rotation for them.",

WTG, XTG, and ATG clean ups. It was as I expected. Shaving with my favorite soap does the trick for me. Great shave with one weeper but that might have been from yesterday's mediocre shave. Great little brush that held enough lather and mild post shave that left me feeling good to go.\n\n**The Soap** worked well. It is my favorite soap of all times and it still remains that way. The scent is amazing as it smells just like freshly peeled oranges. It doesn't have that chemical smell but it smells so natural. The performance is great as usual and the menthol really puts me in a great mood throughout the shave. I would rinse with warm water and put back the chilly lather. Mm mm good!\n\n**The Razor and Blade** combination worked well. I was surprised because it was not as bad as yesterday. It was not perfect but it was good enough for me. Mild combination but smooth and efficient all the way through. I think I'll use the Shark blade couple more times to test out the longevity but at 5th use, it seems to do fine.\n\n**The Brush** felt great. The small brush is not my favorite but it serves perfectly as a travel brush. I've been trying to break in this brush for travel purposes and it's been doing well. It gives a good amount of scrub and enough backbone to feel. Overall, I like this little one.\n\n**The aftershave portion** was great. Mild post shave that I can always rely on. Especially with the menthol from the soap, the slight chill was very nice.\n\nOverall, a great shave. Changing out the soap to Stirling made a big difference. I had a great shave and adding menthol really put me in the mood as well. I know I can't always use Stirling but it is my go-to for a great shave. I'm thinking of abandoning Williams Mug shaving soap as it is too drying for my skin. For next shaves, I'm thinking of using different razor/brush/soap. Maybe soap commander or Siliski's.",

No, I don't know how Coca Cola is ok with that logo either. From Wickham's site:\n\n>There's nothing quite like waking up to the smiling warmth of the sun. Club Cola offers exactly that; a punchy citrus orchestra of bergamot and neroli with a lively, sparkling foundation of caramel and vanilla.\n\n>Top notes: Bergamot, Neroli\n>Heart notes: Vanilla\n>Base notes: Caramel\n\nIt's a good performing soap and I like the scent - it has a a sweet, citrus, summer holiday smell. I just have limited space and other soaps I like more. So if you're interested, reply with a number between 1 and 100 and random.org will determine a winner tomorrow. I will post worldwide (within reason).\n\nAlso I realised that now I have a US-based parcel forwarding address I can participate in CONUS PIFs. So watch out?\n\nHave a great Thursday all!",

I'm just passing it along because I have bought waaay too many razors over the last couple of months.\n\nTo enter reply with a number between 1 and 50 and I'll use a random number generator this evening some time to pick one.

It is so pleasant to use, at least on the first pass. Passes two and especially three are not so good, but the first pass is so efficient and ridiculously smooth. Beautiful day yesterday, reached for CdV as it just seemed to fit the mood and I was rewarded. I can't quite make out what I smell here so I won't attempt to describe it; although if I search for it I can pick out some mousse de saxe along with a green or floral base with some hay. Very good scent and shave following a pretty good 9 holes, capping the night off lounging on the deck. Andddddd I forgot about Theme Thursday again :/ Oh well... one last thing:\n\n##JOHN WICK HYPE!!!!!!",

When I first smelled the puck, I wasn't a big fan. This was my first experience with a bay rum, and I didn't know what to think of the scent. After lathering the soap, however, it's become one of my favorites. A great balance of spice and sweetness, creating a very mature scent that I could wear anywhere. Looking forward to trying more bay rums in the future!",

Smoother today, until just a little razor burn. Asian Plum from A&E was nigh-unscented, I'm afraid.\n\n#### ❧ Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Gibbs - No. 17 Adjustable Setting 2 ::: GSB Gibbs ‹2 uses›)*\n\nSame razor and blade as yesterday, with today being a more normal, one day's growth. Smooth shave, but maybe I got careless in one spot on my neck... or maybe the soap just didn't protect quite well.\n\n#### ❧ Soap Notes\n*^(Ariana & Evans - Asian Plum)*\n\nI liked the scent, but had to stick my face in the puck/ bowl to get a decent whiff.\n\nScent: Plum, with some kind of light floral sometimes showing up. Maybe a hint of something like chocolate.\n\nScent Strength: 2-3/10, almost not present during shaving.\n\nScoop Load: 1/4 tsp soap + lightly-wet boar brush + 2 tsp water = 4 passes of lather, that was a little too wet, but worked okay. Maybe didn't protect too well.\n\nTub Load: 30 second load with lightly-wet low-backbone boar brush + 2 tsp water = 4 passes of perfect, slick, creamy lather.\n\nBowl - I used the XL version of this bowl:\nhttps://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3392930\n\n#### ❧ Brush Notes\n*^(Omega - 10098 Boar‹14 uses›)*\n\nWith this watery-slickness kind of lather, I don't think this brush at this yo9ung age works as well. But it did okay, and was not harsh or prickly. 3 hour soak.\n\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Smooth\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Cut flush to where I just see the tips (above average for me)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm)\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

Performance was fantastic though and the menthol was very nice.\n\nThe first time I tried AV Blue for the scent I poured some into my hand and rubbed it on my wrists, then practically gagged for the next two hours as it slowly gassed off. This time I just held the bottle against my hand and inverted it for a single dot of aftershave and used that. The results? Still got some menthol chill but could hardly even smell the stuff. Much better. Maybe I'll try two dots next time.",

With that in mind, I dug out the first soap and AS I ever used in wetshaving, my Maggards London Barber and some Pinaud Clubman. My intent was to go back and use my Merkur and a synthetic brush but I was running low on time so I grabbed my Declaration and a loaned Aristocrat.\n\n​\n\nHonestly? I had a great shave and I think that London Barber is a very safe soap to recommend to anyone looking to get into wet shaving and Clubman while not the newest, is a great pairing with barbershop soaps and has a classic fougere feel that works really well at an excellent price.\n\n​\n\nIn other news, my wife and I decided last night that the next vacation we take is going to be adults only and we are going to leave our kids with the Grandparents. I'm excited about this as it will be the first time since my daughter was born that we will be able to have several days alone together without kids. I hope y'all have a great Thursday!\n\n​\n\nRobot",

The lather on this is great - slick and shiny once dialled in and good cushion.\n\nDefinitely going to pick up a puck of this.\n\nCheers",

The blade is on its last legs.\n\nI throw a blade in a razor and ride it til it's done. I don't use just one blade and switch it between multiple razors. This is simple and convenient, but I also lose track of how many shaves a blade has. Also, since I use several razors in rotation, perhaps leaving a blade in the razor without using it decreases its efficacy over time. I've also heard the argument that the blades can rust or tea leaf over time, but this hasn't happened to me.\n\nI rarely get more than 4 or 5 shaves on a single blade. I'm not interested in testing blade longevity, they're cheap, I break out a new one whenever I feel like it.\n\nThis system seems to work except on days like today, where I probably would have been happier with a new blade.\n\nAnyways! Still have far better daily shave results than with my old cartridge, so huzzah for that!j",

B&M has quickly become my favorite soap maker of the brands I've tried (granted, that's limited) and I have Seville in Reserve, Hallows and 42 already, in both the soap and aftershave splashes, so a new scent from them is always a must check.\n\nAs a baseball nut (been playing since I was 10, though nowadays it's softball instead), plus with B&M being based in Cooperstown, NY, home of the Baseball Hall of Fame, this immediately piqued my curiosity. This is the fourth time I've used it since I received it, and the scent is exactly what it says it is. Grass and dirt jump out of the tub and lather, with a layer of caramel (as caramel corn) beneath them. As the lather sits a bit you start picking up some leather and hops/beer, and more discerning noses may pick up some woody aromas (I haven't noticed them yet, but B&M says they're there). The splash is dominated by the caramel corn and leather.\n\nAnyone that's spent any length of time around a baseball field knows this scent. It's grass stains on the uniform, dirt on your hands, the leather of the glove and some of the other subtle scents you get from the food and drink wafting in the breeze. Considering the Cooperstown location, B&M gets this one pretty head on. Hell, it even smells like Cooperstown.\n\nBecause baseball.",

I'm not looking forward to the summer time, I have a feeling this year it's going to get pretty bad.\n\n\nSo while the cold weather is here. I treated myself to another go with City Of Ashes. When the heat starts coming I'll be using Tres Matres a whole lot more. This scent is so good, I'm actually still surprised I like it so much.\n\nThe products in general are stellar. I have zero issue building a lather. This vegan formula takes little effort to build, and it takes in a lot of water.\n\nUsing the set Today, I detected more of the bitter orange. Made me think of Chatillon Lux Vide Poche, and the dry down the EdP is excellent, I love it.\n\nGreat shave today. Probably going to switch it up this weekend with something else though.",

Just the soap and aftershave, plus 2 sprays of the EdC to my chest, and I can still pick it up almost 11 hours later. It goes to show that scent concentration (EdC, EdT, EdP, Parfum Extrait) don't necessarily correlate to longevity. It really is a lovely Italian barbershop.",

WTG, XTG, and ATG clean ups. It started out great and came a bit rough towards the end. The brush was awesome to work with. The razor and blade felt great but tuggy during ATG. The soap was a challenge because of the water ratio. Post shave was great but bit burning with the bracer.\n\n**The Soap** worked okay. This was partly my fault because I added too much water to the soap. Razorock soaps in general doesn't need a lot of water. However, coming from yesterday's Stirling shave, I added a ton of water. As a result, it turned thin and bubbly. It still worked for three + passes but razor didn't glide. It felt like scraping the skin without the lather. I'll try again tomorrow and see if it improves with less water.\n\n**The Razor and Blade** combination worked well. The WTG pass was amazing but the closer it got, the rougher it was. ATG was a tough one because the soap didn't have the slickness. The blade felt okay but I might have to change it soon. I'll decide from next shave but I could work it couple more times, from my inference.\n\n**The Brush** felt great. The silvertip brush felts amazing on the face, like a plushy ball. It has low-medium amount of backbone but I do not mind it. It lathered up a lot but a tiny bit less that what I wanted. It gave a good scrub but it didn't hold a lot of lather. I'll be trying it more in the next few shaves to test out its lather-holding capacity.\n\n**The aftershave portion** was great. That Skin Bracer gave me the alcohol burn and somehow, I liked it. I felt like the kid from home alone right as I put it onto my skin. Feel the burn, feel the burn. Good amount of menthol and I felt each tiny cut closing up. The Stirling balm helped moisturize the skin and I was good to go.\n\nOverall, a decent shave. I feel that the lather determines the quality of the shave. Some soaps make it easier while others don't. However, even my favorites like Stirling can give me less optimal shave if I don't dial in the water or load enough soap. Razorock soaps can work well with the right amount of water. In couple days, I'll be shaving with the same setup to see if I can get a better shave. Perhaps the blade is the issue but I feel that I can get a better shave with the optimal lather. Also, I got a stirling badger in the mail! That will be showing up in pictures soon.",

Random.org chose [5](https://i.imgur.com/tsQCVlD.png) which means u/chillaxdude7 was closest with their guess of 4, congrats! PM me with your address and I'll get the tub of Club Cola on its way to you.\n\nNow today's shave. GSBs and Perma Sharps are fine, but neither are as smooth as Polsilvers for me, particularly with the OC.\n\nMy variety pack of WK samples has arrived and I'm excited to work my way through them. The parcel contained a bonus sample with a blank pink label. I assume based on the scent, colour of the label and the other samples I received that this is Chypre Rose Concerto. Thanks WK!\n\nI picked King of Oud to try first at random. The primary note I get is rose. I'm not the world's biggest fan of rose and my wife actively dislikes it, so this was unlikely to ever be a favourite. However I appreciate that it is a really well put together rose accord. It's well balanced, not too sweet and the oud compliments the rose very well. I highly recommend it to fans of rose!\n\nPerformance was as expected with WK bases - fantastic.\n\nHave a great Friday all!",

I don't really like Derby blades, but it was MUCH better on the second use, probably because I just shaved on Wed, and the soap is such a banger.

High tide at 11:05 tonight.\n\nRough shave this morning. Irritation city this morning, all over the map. I did have Chiseled Face - Ghost Town Barber pulled out to go along with the Arko, but when you splash water on, and that stings, you switch it up to a balm.\n\nFirst go with Arko. Not a bad soap, but post-shave attributes are seriously lacking. I picked up two sticks from Maggard's for the Father's Day shave. I would have only picked up one, but you have to buy two. I will probably keep it around, use it a few more times as a stick, and then decide if I want to grate it into a tub.\n\nHave a nice Friday everyone!",

First go with Mammoth that I got in a trade, its just incredible. The scent is to die for. To me it smells like a cherry almond, but I am the only one that I've heard say that. I get no leather from it, which frankly I'm okay with. This is probably a top 2 scent for me, possibly even 1 passing NeV. The performance was amazing as well. u/mammothben you have a real winner here!\n\nYesterday I took my last final exam. Moving out today, which means I've offically completed my first year of college.

It's quite good, and is a noticeable improvement over the earlier base. The earlier base was good, and it's not like I'm selling off my History 101 set, but the new one is definitely better. Bell Ringer was a touch sweeter than I had expected, but the strong citrus cuts the sweetness nicely. It smells vaguely like a citrus heavy juice box. And it's a very strong scent. Definitely hits the goal they were going for: \"that attention getter that snaps out of your sleep and gets you ready for the day.\" I'm an evening shaver, but I often have lots of work I do after my shave in the evening. I was exhausted after work yesterday, so it was definitely a nice pick-me-up.",

Performance is always good from Southern Witchcrafts. Courtney did a great job capturing the essence of the theme. Lathering the soap brings out a smoky leather and I got an occasional whiff of something industrial like diesel or that petroleum smell that's on new clothes in SE Asia. It's a good smell though. Mrs Cosmo says it reminds her of Fa Soap. I think that's an Asian thing, I've never heard of it.\n\nI took the EdP for a test run on the back of my hand yesterday, as I usually do with a new fragrance. It dries down into a smooth smoky leather with a slight kick of citrus. I'm wearing it properly for the real test today. So far I'm a fan.\n\nIt made me think of a new soap idea. The scent would be oud, leather, sweat, and iron maybe. Call it \"Bondage\". You're welcome to it, u/phteven_j , just don't ask what I was doing when I came up with it... 😇",

The other silvertips just don't have the backbone and 'springiness' that the two band has. Just feels so good to lather this one up.\n\nAfter a few recent shaves with the Excelsior base, I find it is definitely a step up to the Glissant. This base is easier to lather up but the shave is not as good imo. I managed to get a thick lather that felt slick but not as much as I've become used to with Excelsior. I am tempted to PIF this soap and get it in Excelsior... let's see.\n\nThe nacet blade did not feel right tonight. Maybe my technique was off but I found a patch of uncut hair to the side of my face that I had to clean up. Maybe another shave to see if there's something left in this blade.\n\nComtemplation AS is great - I like the cooling 'burn' after that is not too harsh but feels good.\n\nHave a good Friday folks!",

Van Yulay Tallow and emu base feels great. It is slick, Cushy, and has nice face feel though it does require a bit more water than I am used to. The Aetolus is a nice fresh scent. The Nacet blade felt more comfortable on it's second shave, and the shave was going so well I decided to go for a third pass. I even went against the grain on my neck (which I NEVER do)! Despite giving myself a little razor burn, I achieved a pretty close shave with not much discomfort. You can bet I put a LOT of balm on though! Hope everyone is having a great day and a quality shave!",

Still hope to get a 10th use with no problem, and this is typical of other AC blade performance for me.\n* **Brush**: This is an amazing brush for roughly $20 or so. Looks great, superlative ergonomics, and loads and lathers impeccably. Proof that the joys of wetshaving do not necessarily cost a lot!\n* **Soap**: Great scent and performance as always - but Mr. Clod (me) dropped the lid on the bathroom floor and the plastic rim partially shattered. This has happened before with these higher end hard plastic tubs. They look and feel great, but have glass jaws, or rather glass rims. (The lip of the bottom part of the tub also breaks very easily.)\n* The partially mangled lid creates no real problems in either sealing or product preservation, but looks sad, and reminds me of why I am not a neurosurgeon.\n* **Frag**: MB is sort of like a higher end L'Occitane, found in malls that charge for parking, offer \"concierges\", and have marble floors. Molton Brown frags are interesting, and occupy an interesting / uneasy price point, halfway between Old Spice EDC from CVS and the $50 an ounce stuff at Sephora.\n* This is a very nice well balanced oud mix, lightened up to avoid the usual agar bombast, but (as with most mall store scents) with mediocre longevity (3 hours or so) and limited projection. Worth a try if you've always hated oud; this may change your mind.",

Gone are the artemisia, cumin, juniper, carnation, coriander, geranium, jasmine, marjoram, rose, thyme, amber, frankincense, tobacco, and leather. All that's left over are lavender, bergamot, and basil up top; pine in the heart; and oakmoss, patchouli, cedar, and musk in the base. Aside from the pine, cedar, and musk, that's basically a traditional barbershop fougere. It's good stuff: mossy, green, slightly woody, and super smooth.\n\nGreen Aqua Velva compliments it nicely with a hefty dose of moss along with some green notes, woods, and citrus. Sheeit this stuff is nice, especially applied *in moderation* so it doesn't smell like you're swimming in a pool of cheap green cologne.\n\nStill getting good shaves out of this yellow Gillette so far. Pretty happy with these ones.",

I like a hit of menthol in aftershaves, but menthol in soaps just never really appealed to me. In aftershave, the menthol typically dissipates in a few minutes for me, but cold face for ~15-20 minutes? ennnn. That's likely why I passed on Cannonball when it was released last summer. I think I was going to pick up a sample, but never got around to it? I landed on some Cannonball in a Lather Games trade, figured OK, i'll use it on Summer Break day, btw, smells nice.\n\nThen the fine proprietor of Summer Break, /u/rocket455 posted the other day that Cannnonball was coming back in his new base, and regret or FOMO set in. See, I love the old Summer Break base, and all I got is this little lather games portion of the stuff. ThErE WiLl AlWaYs Be MoRe SoAp, though. But I figured why not throw up a Bazaar post, and the community came through and I secured a tub (thanks for the 3rd time). So, don't need this for Lather Games, let's use it today...\n\nMy fear of a freezing cold and uncomfortable shave was largely unneeded. Is it cold, sure. Is it uncomfortable, not in the slightest bit, I suspect due to the fact that synthetic menthol is was used. Is this something i'd use every day? No, probably not, but I think it will absolutely scratch an itch and the tub should last me a couple (many?) years at the rate i'll likely use it. Nice job sir, even though the greater shaving public thinks lanolin is important for their fictitious post-shave :)",

Nestled within that package, wrapped in black and purple tissue paper, were two Southern Witchcrafts soaps, two aftershaves, and an EdP. I'm saving Valley of Ashes for tomorrow because I'm not sure if it's really a work scent or not. So today, it was the Grapefruit. This was my first time lathering from a full-sized tub of SW and it was glorious. I took a Marco approach and sent the brush into the tub fairly damp...swirled about 100 times with the tips just lightly grazing the surface of the soap, and then moved up to my noggin to build the lather. The airy bubbly foam quickly coalesced into a thick rich lather. I did one pass across the grain and one pass against the grain. No nicks, cuts, weepers, or razor burn... just a near-BBS skull. The alcohol-free splash was a nice finish and left my skin feeling soft and nourished. I topped it all off with a bit of Guerlain Homme L'Eau Boisée which has a nice mojito opening and a very satisfying vetiver dry-down.",

Trying out the Gibbs with a new Nacet blade; was a great match. And a new-to-me scent from the Club.\n\n#### ❧ Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Gibbs - No. 17 Adjustable Setting 4 ::: Nacet - Gibbs ‹1 uses›)*\n\nBumped it up to 4 of 6 just to see how it felt. It was refreshing to see that this didn't change it too much, because it wasn't too aggressive. Just a little more blade feel. Wonderful shave with the Nacet (a new one I had to modify to work in the Gibbs, not the one of legend :-)\n\nNo tugging or irritation.\n\n#### ❧ Soap Notes\n*^(The Club - Signature)*\n\nThem: \"The notes include Bourbon, Tobacco Absolute and Sandalwood. I blended both Arabian Sandalwood, as well as Tunisian Sandalwood notes for this offering. To round out the base, I added a bit of Agarwood.\"\n\nScent: This is such a nice blend of notes. Manly, and it was easy to pick up the bourbon, while I also noticed the hint of agar and sandalwood. I just wish it wasn't so weak.\n\nScent Strength: 3/10, barely present during shaving.\n\nI really like this soap base. Lather felt great on the face, and in the rinses between passes. Provided excellent glide for razor, too.\n\nNext time, I'll try 3tsp water, since I had to add some to this one during the shave with a spray bottle.\n\n1/4 tsp soap + lightly-wet floppy badger brush + 2.5 tsp water = 5 passes of lather.\n\nBowl - I used the XL version of this bowl:\nhttps://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3392930\n\n#### ❧ Brush Notes\n*^(Semogue - 1800 Boar‹14 uses›)*\n\nThis brush, I think, is starting to get a little too relaxed, even for me. I'm going to put an o-ring on it to rein it in. Comfy though, and did the job. It just splays a little too easily.\n\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Cut flush to where I just see the tips (above average for me)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm)\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

I saw someone mentioning the Rapira Platinum Lux blades as a fit, so I decided to try it out today. BBS shave... however, I had to be suuuuuppperrr careful as I could definitely feel the blade (first time using these blades, btw, and they are *sharp*). The reason I had previously put the V3a away was that I got really close shaves, but at the cost of having to go *reeally* slow and slicing up my legs... not great if I want to wear shorts for the summer!\n\nGreat performance from the Barrister & Mann Velvet, as usual. Really sad they discontinued two of my favourite scents. I will continue to use them sparingly :(\n\nBlue Spruce by Eleven is one of my most favourite scents. Other than B&M's Taiga (my other fav B&M scent), I haven't really found anything similar yet that's not too manly or lumberjack-y. Looking for recommendations!\n\nSo, I guess that means I'm putting the Maggard V3a back into storage, or if any Canadian (or anywhere else if you pay for shipping) wants to give it a try, it's available as a PIF (head only).\n\nHappy Friday everyone! :)",

First, the GC .84, which I couldn't resist buying even though I have no complaints at all about my GC .68. Brand new and with the barberpole handle, it looks beautiful. It's only slightly more aggressive than the .68, considering the increase in efficiency. Where I really noticed the difference vs. the .68 is around my mouth and chin area, where my stubble is the coarsest yet my skin the most sensitive. This area takes several passes (and sometimes a bit of pressure) with the .68 to get really smooth. With the .84, I really avoided using any pressure at all and still got it smooth enough that I didn't need a 4th pass touch up. The other new piece here is the SBS Icy Stare splash. I've come to learn that my favorite splashes contain menthol, but I still have a few that I bought early on which lack this ingredient (including EM). I put a bit of Icy Stare in a spray bottle and just spritzed it on prior to the EM splash. WOW. I can already tell this synthetic menthol is a game changer for me. It's not a full on face-freezer, but has a nice moderate intensity that lasts a LONG time (still felt it lingering almost 40 mins later). I plan to use this a lot in the summer and if you live in a warm climate I highly recommend you try it out (believe it is integrated in the splash formula for SBS Cannonball, which I haven't tried). I like my improvised spray bottle setup because it allows me to calibrate the dosage of Icy Stare depending on the splash I am using with it (ie whether that splash already contains menthol or not). Can't wait to pair it with some non-menthol splashes which have been dormant in my den even though I really enjoy the scents.",

It's such a great scent! I think since it became a Glissant base, I've been using this tub sparingly. Now that it's in Excelsior, I'm not so hesitant to use it lol\n\nI had the time today to use scissors to trim the 'Stacie, and bust out the clippers and trim/even out my chops. Which also meant I could take my sweet time shaving. I was rewarded with one of the best shaves I've had in a few weeks. HELL TO THE MUFUGGIN' YEAH!!!\n\nDFS and it's Friday!

It's a very earthy and somewhat sweet profile that feels soothing to the nose. It's not over-powering at all, and I'd recommend it to anyone who has an affinity towards earthy, grassy and/or slightly sweet notes. As many of you already know, the B&M Excelsior base is an elite level performer. The only base that rivals it in my mind is the current Ariana & Evans tallow base. An excellent shave this evening.",

The GSB was a little harsh, but not completely uncomfortable on it's first use. We'll see if it smooths out or if it's just not a match for the razor. I am really enjoying Lisa's elixir. I know she came out with a new vegan formulation, so hopefully she will feature the matching Ouzoud scent eventually in that line. I stopped at Macy's and Sephora while at the mall the other day and thought I'd take a whiff of the fragrances they had available. I somehow stumbled upon Y as a clear favorite. I do not own any YSL to date, but kept coming back to this one at both stores. It's a very fresh, aquatic scent that is great for summer. I get about 8 hours longevity and the scent is very consistent. It's not a \"unique\" fragrance, but very pleasant. I also liked the YSL Ulitime, and will be picking that one up soon as well.",

I still feel the need to keep (re)trying other blades, but I'm always happy to return to Polsilvers.\n\nThe next WK sample is Monaco Royal. There are lots of scent notes listed, but for me the overall effect is just a male bath soap scent (Imperial Leather for UK folks). Inoffensive but unexciting. It's relatively lightly scented though so you're free to follow up with whatever AS / Frag you like.\n\nION I picked up a G4 Slim on ebay this week and it arrived yesterday. It cleaned up pretty nicely.\n[Before, from ebay listing](https://imgur.com/a/2hTkuwA) and [after](https://imgur.com/a/dOlUJ3B)\nIt was really satisfying and relaxing to gradually clean and polish it. I can absolutely see the attraction of refurbishing vintage razors.\n\nIt's been a rough week at work, thank goodness for the weekend. Wish you all a good one!",

It was my #3 for the A&E sets that I have, but it's kind of creeping up there in usage. I think the scent is light enough for everyday use and I only get maybe 5 hrs of the scent from the AS. The powderiness of the soap reminds me of a barbershop, but not quite. It's like an aquatic barbershop to me. Anyway, have a great day folks!",

I don't have much experience with the artisan, but the foamy lather I started with turned into loads of nice lather. Diesel and tar stuck out prior to shaving, but the only difference I detected while lathering was the leather with the occasional whiff of bourbon. I'll be honest, I didn't hate it as much as I thought I would, but I don't think I'd pick up a full set.\n\nLife is short, shave with good gear.",

I used it today with the same brush I used with Tabac yesterday and I still cannot detect any difference in the bases between the two soaps. What does that mean? Well, two things really. For those that want to experience the Tabac base, but can't stand the smell, buy a puck of Fine. And for those like me who like the scent of Tabac, but want more variety, Fine soaps offer a lot of scents in that very good performing base.\n\nA good amount of outside work is in my future today.",

Trying out a new-to-me scent from Cold River.\n\n#### ❧ Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Gibbs - No. 17 Adjustable Setting 5 ::: Nacet - Gibbs ‹2 uses›)*\n\nA great match gave a VERY efficient shave today, taking it all down in just 2 passes! Not typical for me at all.\n\nI bumped it up to a 5 today... not because I felt like I needed to, but just to see what the feel was like. It was very smooth for such a setting. A little blade feel, but man, have they got this geometry right for people of my face/skin/beard type! My skin felt really nice after just the first pass.\n\nI did hit a small area on my neck the wrong direction and got just a little razor burn, but it subsided very quickly.\n\n#### ❧ Soap Notes\n*^(Cold River Soap Works Glide - Winter)*\n\nThem: \"Top notes of eucalyptus, citrus and ozone with nuances of cranberry. Mid notes of warm spices, carnation and tuberose blend into a warm base of cedar and balsam.\"\n\nScent: This may be my fav winter scent that I've tried. It just doesn't have the fir notes or heavy spices that often push me away. I easily picked up cranberry, ozone, and a hint of the floral. A nice blend that, while not being particularly inspiring if you don't consider the season, is still enjoyable and beats out many others, for me at least, in the winter seasonal category.\n\nScent Strength: x/10, X present during shaving.\n\nVery little secondary slickness, and the razor was slower on the face than most other soaps. A bit ironic that they would call this base \"Glide\". However, I did just get a 2 pass shave, where most of the time it takes 3 to get this close. So maybe sliding around my face like greased lightning isn't all it's cracked up to be.\n\n1/4 tsp soap + lightly-wet stiff dense boar brush + 2 tsp water = 4 passes of lather.\n\nBowl - I used the XL version of this bowl:\nhttps://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3392930\n\n#### ❧ Brush Notes\n*^(Stirling - Boar 24mm Factory Seconds‹14 uses›)*\n\nThe center of the brush still has great backbone/very stiff from the core and up till about half way. But the tips have a good bit of flex, so it feels massagey at this point. still young, so plenty of time for those tips to split and get soft. Worked well.\n\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Smooth\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Cut flush to where I just see the tips (above average for me)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm)\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

I received my Valley of Ashes set as well as a couple of Contract Techs which I'll be gifting to friends. Then yesterday, there was a Wolfman drop and I finally ordered myself one of those pieces of functional art. And then this morning I saw on the front page of TryThatSoap that Try This Soap 2.0 is coming out on the first day of Lather Games. What a time to be alive!\n\nGreat shave this morning. The B5 Dogclaration was my first real piece of artisan gear and it's just such a great brush that it ruined me for all other brushmakers. I love the smell of Uplift. It's very lemony and not overly sweet. Whipped up a great lather and the single edge just chopped through several days worth of growth leaving me somewhere between DFS and BBS.\n\nSpeaking of DFS, I was reading a thread on DFS yesterday where someone was talking about how he had 3 different levels of BBS. Is it just me, or does this seem like too fine a distinction? I mean... that's like claiming that a 97 shavescore and a 96 shavescore are legitimately different categories. Or maybe I'm just a Gen X a**hole yelling at the Boomers to stop yelling at the Millenials to get off of their lawns. Go back inside, Harold. that PBA tournament ain't gonna watch itself.",

Preshave - Unscented\n**Brush:** Stirling Badger\n**Razor:** Rockwell 6S (R4)\n**Blade:** Rapira Super Stainless (2)\n**Lather:** [Elvado - Mayan Vanilla Almond - Cream](https://trythatsoap.com/collection/911/?product_type=cream)\n**Post Shave:** [Captain's Choice - Lime - Balm](https://trythatsoap.com/collection/132/?product_type=balm)\n\n\nI wanted something a little sweeter for Summer with a citrus zing. The Elvado cream was the closest thing I had to citrus, but it fit the bill for sweet. The stuff smells amazing. It's three notes: Vanilla, almond, and cherry. I would classify its performance as OK, but worth the non-stellar performance for the great scent.\n\nThe lime balm gave me the citrus I was after, so no complaints there.\n\nAfter using my new R41 for a couple of weeks, the shave with the 6S was like being on cruise control on a straight highway, totally effortless. I also noticed that the R41 has made my shaving technique much better. I normally use mild razors that are pretty forgiving of sloppy technique, but an aggressive razor does not allow for such things.",

I know we always hear beginners say \"I have sensitive skin\" when really they're just bad at shaving, but I legitimately have sensitive skin and every time I face-lather with this brush I come away with a wicked case of brush burn. This makes me think that if I can't even handle a 70/30 badger/boar brush, I probably couldn't handle a pure boar brush at all. I should probably just stick to my synth brushes.\n\nNo perfume today because I'm hanging out with my wife and she's too scentsitive for me to wear pretty much Anything.",

It makes me think of what my grandfather's barbershop likely smelled like, and it's a great scent to have under my nose. The aftershave is wonderful too, with the bit of menthol that Chiseled Face adds.\n\nI got a great BBS today, but my lather wasn't great...still working on my bowl lather skills, and I added way too much water. The 7 O'clock is still treating me well though, and my Grand Shave King allowed me to get a wonderful close shave without nicking myself despite a thin lather.",

A couple things about the scent:\n\n- The dry, not particularly sweet violet is really nice.\n- there's something in there that makes me think of yellow mustard.\n- Still, it may well be my favorite violet-focused scent.\n\nThis is also my first time shaving with Excelsior and Deltus. They are excellent, without flaw, but I am so spoiled that they does not seem particularly out of the ordinary.\n\nI think I also am just less discriminating about soap bases than some other folks. Excelsior is without flaw for me, but so is Reserve, and Glissant, and Latha, and White Label. I'm thinking of compiling a list of my own personal shave scores, and like 80%+ of them are going to get 100.",

I keep a bottle of Clubman on my counter at all times because he wants to participate in shaving with Dad.\n\nI'm getting the final touches done on my Lather Games setup. I was close to hitting 30 fragrances so I bought a bottle of CK Eternity for Men. It's a bit dated and the EdT strength is pretty weak, but I remembered why it was so popular in the 90's. As a Fougere sent, it really doesn't compare to Fougere Royale, but it's crisp and clean with a bit of an citrus and soap overtone. This is something that is 100% a safe reach. I don't think it'd an perfect paring to Fougere Trois, but it would be an ideal compliment to some Black Ship Grooming Philips Fougere.\n\nHave a good Saturday!\n\nRobot",

Used some DG Sweet Lemon and paired it with some Tom Ford Grey Velvetier. It's a good combo. The GV has some citrus they goes well with the DG Lemon and the Velvitier compliments the soap base of Icarus. It feels like the scents are made for one another.\n\nMy wife confessed to me today she didn't care for my TF. She feels that the Velvetier has too much of an old man smell to it. I personally like it and feel that it's a classy, mature scent, but I can see how she would arrive at that. She's more in the camp of Aventus, Spicebomb and DG The One, but I personally don't feel those are office appropriate scents.\n\nRobot",

It was smooth, intuitive to find the right angle and had just a little more blade feel than I was expecting. Nicely balanced, no irritation. It's not just a pretty face!\n\nMan from Mayfair is WK's barbershop scent, and like Monaco Royal it's relatively mildly scented. I got a decent amount of basil from it, and also some sandalwood. It's a perfectly pleasant scent but I think I prefer my barbershops with a bit more character, like Ghost Town Barber.\n\nHope you're all having a good weekend!",

Mostly cloudy, with a high near 61. South wind 10 to 15 mph. Chance of precipitation is 70%. New precipitation amounts of less than a tenth of an inch possible. High tide at 12:29 this afternoon.\n\nToday's shave was decided by the fact that my head saw a little bit more sun yesterday that I expected, so I wasn't going to use an alcohol based aftershave this morning. That meant no Ruby's Green this morning, which is what I had set out. Wanted a nice bright citrus scent so Helios it was.\n\nPerformance, while nice a few years ago, is not a contender with the current artisan market. Where the line really excels is the Scale Polish. It ties for best aftershave product that I have ever used with Declaration Grooming's liniment.\n\nHave a nice Sunday!",

Just two passes again! Wanted to Try the Agar soap... finally. And see how the Manchurian handled a nice long soak before the shave. And lastly, to try the Gibbs at its highest setting.\n\n#### ❧ Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Gibbs - No. 17 Adjustable Setting 6 ::: Nacet - Gibbs ‹3 uses›)*\n\nAt the highest setting this razor was capable of giving me some razor rash, but with care I avoided it. This is a very enjoyable and usable range for me with this little guy. Excellent cut.... so good I only needed 2 passes.\n\nNo tugging or irritation.\n\n#### ❧ Soap Notes\n*^(Stirling - Agar)*\n\nMight be a good one to blend with some other more basic soaps,,,, for some variations.\n\nScent: straight up, awesome Oud/Agar.\n\nScent Strength: x/10, X present during shaving.\n\nVery good slick lather today.\n\n40 second load with lightly-wet, dense, badger brush + 4.5 tsp water = 5-6 passes of lather. I overshot the mark just a little.\n\nBowl - I used the XL version of this bowl:\nhttps://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3392930\n\n#### ❧ Brush Notes\n*^(Elite Razor - Manchurian Fan CravingShaving Blue/White 26mm‹5 uses›)*\n\nStill a bit resistant to splay during lathering. Had a few hour soak this time to see if it would help.\n\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Cut flush to where I just see the tips (above average for me)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm)\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

I'm a big fan of the Voskhod blades, they give me a close shave with no irritation which is all I can ask for. Gonna be using them and GSBs exclusively going forward.\n\nI was gonna go with Seville this morning but hadn't reached for Barrbarr in a couple of weeks. Post shave feel is a step down from some of the others at the top imo but it's still very good. I really enjoy the different takes on Barbershop scents and this one is no exception. Currently debating if I want to jump on the Bandwagon set but I already have a few DG offerings.\n\nHeading out to get a round of golf in before playing in a scramble later this week.",

Some days it's more bergamot to my nose, some days it's more lavender. Either way, I enjoy it. Followed it up with two dots of Ice Blue, which seems like just the right amount to be able to smell it but not drown in it.\n\n8 shaves seems to be the end for this SharpEdge. I could probably keep going if I didn't aim for BBS on my neck *every damn day* but uh I'm a dummy, so time for a fresh blade.\n\nI think I'm going to stop posting shaves of the day for the rest of May so I can discretely test out some of my Lather Games combinations and make sure they're going to work as well as I hope. I don't want to go in flying blind and end up wearing something awful because it sounded good on paper. I'll be back June 1 for the games... It's only 12 shaves away, folks!",

I had a sample of the soap prior to the drop, so I pretty much knew what to expect. As promised, the tub held notes of oil, rubber, and dirt. It's not an offensively dirty smell... it's not like getting slapped in the face with a mechanic's shop rag. But it is grungy. It opens up a bit on lathering, some of the bourbon and leather come out and it's more like being in a recently-serviced classic car than being in the garage where the car is being serviced.\n\nThe first thing I noticed about the aftershave was the color. It looks nearly as dirty as the soap smells, which is honestly pretty cool. The aftershave continues the progression away from the oil and rubber notes and brings more of the bitter citrus and clove into the mix. As you would expect from Southern Witchcrafts, the splash soothes and feeds the recently scraped skin quite nicely. My only thought here is that it's a bit sad that SW isn't doing alcohol splashes yet because this is a scent profile that almost screams out for a bit of alcohol burn to go along with it.\n\nThe EdP is just fantastic. Court really knocked it out of the park on this one. When I first got my hands on a sample of the soap, I asked phteven just how close the frag would be to the soap's scent profile and he said they were still working it out because the diesel was overpowering the rest of the notes. When I close my eyes and smell the EdP, I get the tobacco, clove, and leather notes pretty strongly. The bourbon is hanging just underneath with some of the bitter citrus. And it's all riding along above a just barely concealed layer of industrial filth. It's not an every day wear and it may not be a superb warm weather scent, but this is a really enjoyable and surprisingly wearable (far more so than 3Sheets, IMHO) grungy fragrance.\n\nAlso, first shave today with my recently acquired triangle-slot Contract Tech. Nice razor. Many thanks to Chuck at ShaveHQ for setting me up and also helping me find the parts I needed to complete a couple of gift razors for friends.",

WTG, XTG, and ATG clean ups. A little rushed shave but good one nonetheless. The razor & blade worked well. The brush was soft and did its job. The soap smelled great and provided good slickness and protection. Ended with a good chilly post shave.\n\n**The Soap** worked well. This is one of the best mass produced soaps in my collection. Soaps like Proraso perform okay but this soap gives a bit better shave. Nice floral/fruity scent that almost resembles shampoo. It provides good slickness and good protection throughout the shave. It lasted for the two passes + clean ups so I really enjoyed it.\n\n**The Razor and Blade** combination worked well. The Merkur 34C is really the standard razor to go to. It performs excellent every time without disappointment. I didn't overbuff my face and that was a smart decision. That resulted in non-BBS shave but I'm okay with it. It still looked clean and that's what mattered today. The blade was efficient and smooth but not the best. It'll work for couple more shaves and I'll determine its uses after that.\n\n**The Brush** felt great. This 26mm brush was a bit big in the beginning but it feels like the right size now. Very soft and it has that \"synthetic backbone\" It's doesn't feel harsh but there is a fair bit of resistance from the bristle pushing against the face. I do enjoy it for what it is and I'll continue to use it.\n\n**The aftershave portion** was great. My go-to setup for post shave. It doesn't fail me and the menthol still continues to impress me. My face feels great after the shave and I can't wait to go back to work! Haha jokes on you.\n\nOverall, the shave was good. All of the products I used perform well and there is nothing to complain about. Standard razor and good synthetic brush with some backbone. Great soap that smells good and performs well. I'd say this shave was a bit boring but I did get a good shave out of it. Next shave will probably be in couple days. I'll use the Stirling Finest Badger with some artisan soaps.. maybe Stirling?",

I mostly get earthy and soil notes mixed in with a light buttery sweetness from the popcorn and caramel underneath the grass and earth. As most of you are already aware, the B&M Excelsior base is an elite level performer regardless of scent. It's only rivaled by the Ariana & Evans current beef tallow base in my opinion. What an excellent shave on this Sunday evening.",

Went to church, bought some Herod on /r/fragranceswap and then went home cleaned and watched Game of Thrones. No spoilers (because I'm not a dick) but either way, I am glad to see the show through the end.\n\nFinally broke out my EdP of Fougere Gothique I traded for last month that came along with the soap and AS. I don't care for it. The opening is strong and I only used a single spray. Smoke, char, oak moss, wet musky dirt all come out. It would be a good match for some Midnight Stag or Texas on Fire I would think.\n\nThe drydown mellows the acrid notes and some lavender sweetness comes out. That was actually very pleasant. I suspect I'll be selling or trading this set off after the Lather Games.\n\nIn other news I shaved with Two Kings, the set that made me fall in love with Noble Otter. As usual amazingly performance and my Karve just allows for a mindless shave on the first two passes. All in all a good way to end the night.\n\nHave a good one, Robot!\n\n\nRobot",

Today is Le Piment de la Vie, tomorrow is WK Spice Vitae. Same name, different(ish) scents.\n\nLe Piment is a sweet, not too heavily spiced scent. I could definitely smell the cinnamon from the start with some ginger coming through later on.\n\nIf I were to purely by the notes listed for each soap Le Piment should be significantly less complex than Spice Vitae. I'm not sure that's true though as my wife got notes of smoke, wood and patchouli. This is definitely a soap I'll come back to, as I think it may grow on me.\n\nAlso notable today, I combined a baby changing mat and an old baby sheet to make a janky af sweep for the photo. Product photography is hard yo. Sadly my proper tripod is on loan and my gorilla pod is being used for the baby monitor!\n\nHave a good Monday all!",

I won't go into too many platitudes but sufficed say, it's amazing and if you haven't tried it I would highly recommend it. My only regret is that I didn't pick up a set sooner and I can't always say that about all soaps.\n\nIn other news, I competed my first paying soap label design yesterday. Soap, AS and EdP labels all done. Proofs have been approved and the vectors are going out after I clean up my layer organization for the company/printer shop. It feels incredibly satisfying to have another outlet for art that can cross over into a hobby I enjoy so much and I am so greatful for the Artisan to give me a chance to play a small role in the development of a soap. That said, It's not my place to say who the label is for, or what the final design is, but I am very proud of how it turned out and I think y'all will like it when it's finally released.\n\nFinally the Maggards meetup is quickly approaching. I don't know about y'all, but I have a list of soaps I want to check out when I'm there. It honestly feels like I am going to be a kid in a candy shop.\n\nY'all have a good Monday.\n\nRobot",

Wanted to try the Gibbs at the lowest setting, and visit the new maker, Murphy & McNeil.\n\n#### ❧ Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Gibbs - No. 17 Adjustable Setting 1 ::: Nacet - Gibbs ‹4 uses›)*\n\nA wonderful smooth shaver at this, its lowest setting. Still got a great shave and close cut.\n\nNo tugging or irritation.\n\n#### ❧ Soap Notes\n*^(Murphy and McNeil Tallow & Duck - Claddagh)*\n\nI didn't pick up any of the top citrus notes, but I did like the scent.\n\nScent: I got the Green Tea and maybe Black Currant, and probably the musk, but the Sandalwood was more hidden. Some combination of something gave me a tobacco impression, though that is not listed in the notes.\n\nScent Strength: 4-5/10, present during shaving.\n\nLather wasn't top-tier, but still very nice. Great glide and felt good on my face. More of a cream than a croap.\n\n1/4 tsp soap + lightly-wet boar brush + 3 tsp water = 4 passes of lather.\n\nBowl - I used the XL version of this bowl:\nhttps://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3392930\n\n#### ❧ Brush Notes\n*^(Semogue - 2000 Boar‹14 uses›)*\n\nComfy guy by now. Just soaked for 30 mins or so. Probably don't need that kind of break-in shortcut any more.\n\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Smooth\n*Neck*: Smooth\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Cut flush to where I just see the tips (above average for me)\n\nP.S. I haven't even begun to plan for the Lather Games!! =-0\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm)\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

Triple-milled, to me a light-scented sandalwood. Only thing I don't care for is that I bought the travel stick, and it makes applying a triple-milled soap to the face rather difficult. First, it doesn't smoothly glide over your face akin to deodorant to your armpit. Second, you have to rub your face for at least 30 seconds and even still you probably didn't get enough to transfer, especially if you shaved the prior day. I shook out all my moisture from my brush and I managed to get a good-looking lather. It lacks the slickness that we've come to expect with our top-tier soaps, but it did do the job. I was afraid to add too much water, and when I rinsed my face between passes, the resulting re-application of lather was on the verge of disappearing. I'm not a fan, but maybe I need to try smearing it in a shave bowl and lathering from there. Just kinda defeats the purpose of a travel-friendly shave stick, you know?\n\nLife is short, shave with good gear.",

Icarus leaves my skin feeling so soft after a shave, so that's my benchmark. This is also a very good base and extremely easy to use. I don't think it's as nourishing as Icarus though. Still very enjoyable and I like the scent on this soap quite a bit. Nice way to kick off the new week.",

Think I have to get the sampler so I can figure out which scent to get my puck in.\n\nI'm starting to think that I'm not scooping enough soap out of the sample because I'm not getting enough lather for three passes and it feels a bit watery. Will keep experimenting. Lather games should give me plenty of sample loading opportunity.\n\nHere we go Monday.",

Some of the storms could produce heavy rain. Areas of fog before 8am. High near 76. Southwest wind 5 to 10 mph. Chance of precipitation is 80%. New rainfall amounts between a tenth and quarter of an inch, except higher amounts possible in thunderstorms. High tide at 1:16 this afternoon. [Wells Harbor Weather Station](https://i.imgur.com/JbtYSE6.jpg)\n\nNice shave this morning. Lather was nice and slick, but took a little bit to get there. This is a really great scent, green, and dirty, with the smell of tomato leaves. This is the one splash that I have added menthol to, as when I used it always wanted that bite of cooling. Over all a nice shave.\n\nHave a nice Monday everyone!",

Oakmoss, sandalwood, and patchouli comes together for a sweet earthy feel, perfect for a rainy SoCal Monday.\n\nThe addition of some florals with Southern Witchcrafts Lavender AS splash works great with the earthiness of the soap. Applied to damp skin it feels and smells fantastic.\n\nThe icing on the cake is Chatillion Lux Lavande Poivre EdT. This is a complex fragrance that is a great example of how scents can change during the dry down. The lavender and black pepper top notes morph into a floral rosemary and I'm left with a great patchouli combo in the base. It's really so good. Scent level is mid to strong and I wish it were an EdP because I want more. It's really well done.\n\nStarting my first of a two week break between semesters. It will be nice.",

On my first try with my go-to blade (Wizamet) the shave felt a bit harsh, reminding me of the Blackland Dart. Despite the feeling, the shave was as close as my favorite razors, with no irritation, and that BBS feeling lasted all day. When I switched to a Voskhod blade, the shave became noticeably smoother while maintaining the closeness and efficiency I had the first time- win.\n\n\nI tried the razor with 1, 2, and 3 days of growth. Each time it was easy to use and left no irritation. Big plus there, as often more efficient razors are not fun to use two days in a row while milder razors struggle with thicker growth.\n\n\nThe fit and finish are impeccable. My only gripe with the appearance is the handle shape isn't quite my style, but I've been assured the production handle will be different.\n\n\nIn all I'm sad to see this one leave the den, but I look forward to seeing the final product.\n\n\nOleo's No. 11 is a dupe of Maison Margiela's At the Barber's, an appealingly modern take on a barbershop. Nefertiti is not a match, but I love it and couldn't pass up a chance to use it again. I'm still breaking in the 28mm Druida, but after just a few uses it's already a joy to use.",

I keep finding new layers and depth in this scent. The performance of the soap is what we have all come to expect from B&M. I also use it shaving my head and I can tell a real difference in my skin afterwards. It's just damn good stuff and a great way to start the week.\n\nAs far the the Headblade razor, it's certainly not as nice as a good DE. But the form and shape of the handle are exactly what I need to shave my head In the shower without tearing it to shreds. I believe a good soap makes a bigger difference here.\n\nHappy Monday y'all!",

Thanks to /u/reut0 I now have both a Matte handle and a Matte stand. Gotta say this looks great with the Rockwell head!\n\nFeels like i'm having a slightly different shave than what I am used to despite everything but the handle being the same. The TRH7 is *only* 5.5 grams heavier than the TRH5 and yet you can really tell the difference.",

      "body": "Monday 5/20 SOTD\n\n* Razor: RazoRock Gamechanger 0.68 w Super Knurl handle\n* Blade: Bolzano (2)\n* Brush: 24mm Stirling fan\n* Soap: Wholly Agrumi in Estate tallow DM amino acids base\n* Post: Krampert's Frostbite splash\n* Frag: Acqua Di Parma original scent EDC\n\nProduct Notes:\n\n* **Razor**: A \"gamechanger\" perhaps in terms of build quality to price ratio. Fit and finish is impeccable. However the bottom plate mounted blade retention posts (versus the more usual underside of the top cap location for the posts) make blade loading more like an AC SE loading - mildly fraught with peril for the non-dextrous - but hardly a mankiller.\n* More problematically, the GC 0.68 cannot deliver a two pass BBS, my new standard for 2019 after I grew tired of 35 to 40 minute shaves. A good two pass can be done in 21 to 25 mins, and as a daily shaver, that 98 minutes per week adds up.\n* The GC actually can barely offer a DFS in two passes let along a BBS. A three pass shave BBS is quite possible with the GC (though maybe not so easily with the only moderately sharp Bolzano) and the face feel is mild and reassuring.\n* I am looking for reasons to use fewer razors, and the GC's inability to attain the entirely arbitrary standard of a two pass BBS may move it all the way to the back of the closet.\n* As far as mild shavers go, the RazoRock Babysmooth, Feather AS D2, and the Gamechanger are all in the same category of \"too slow speed BBS\" razors. The ATT M1 and Maggard V3M can both offer a quick BBS with a sharp blade. Have not tried the RR Mamba yet, but with a 0.53 gap, I am a bit pessimistic. (Though the Timeless bronze 0.38 is a very efficient razor for me, so gap is not the be-all and end-all.)\n* **Brush:** Perhaps the finest entry level badger. Still going strong more than two years after purchase, no hair loss, no horizontal stragglers, and even the Stirling printed logo is still fully legible.\n* **Soap:** Done as a special scent for TSM, this is a fine moderately complex citrus scent. The base was an evolutionary dead end, adding amino acids to the tallow / DM base, and these did... absolutely nothing as far as I can tell, as the soap shaves exactly as well as the (excellent) tallow DM base and offers none of the perceptual \"next level\" (admittedly only a somewhat higher one) of the WK Bufala base. No other WK soaps ever came out in the tallow / DM / AA base, so this one is rare.\n* **Post:** Hot weather means I can go back to splash use without seeing my face look like that of Thanos. Kramperts is a gem, offering a simple yet elegant frankincense scent, menthol that first shocks and then soothes, and a very effective botanical mix that the maker (oddly) does not detail much about nor make any claims about. Neertheless, my face feels a billion times better after using this that it does with the more basic alcohol based splashes out there, so something magical is going on here. Great way to start a hot day!",

Two Kings is a great scent, but I feel like I wish it was stronger. It reminds me of TexAus in that regard. Maybe Two Kings will be one of the fragrances Cody has been teasing.\n\nI've been comparing the 3\" and 3.5\" handles on my Karve, and I'm still trying to get all of my feelings on the plates figured out. It's pretty easy to compare the A plate to the D plate, but figuring out the C vs. the D plate and the SB C vs. the OC C plate is a little more nuanced.\n\nRegardless, I smell great and my face feels fantastic.",

I've been using it more often these past few weeks and it had grown on me. To the point that I think I'm going to pick up another set before they go out of production - if there's anyone in Canada trying to get rid of their BtW set, let me know.\n\nAfter using Glissant and Excelsior back to back, it's more apparent that the new base is a big improvement, even if it does take a little more time/water to get it dialed in right. The post shave and the deltus AS are excellent.\n\nThe Nacet blade worked a lot better today - I think it may be the lather that was nicer this time. The badger brush is just awesome - it really works well with this soap as well.\n\nHoliday long Monday here but the weather in Canada is just annoying - sunny but windy as hell today, yesterday it was warm for a couple hours and then cold again. Just nothing consistent and it's annoying.\n\nHave a good Monday folks!",

I wish it had more hold (and am taking recommendations on that front) but the smell is very pleasant.\n\n*Lather Games:* Alright and but so like that I wanted to do a thing where I do a countdown of sorts, for songs I mean. I was thinking a list of some kind *or* a Top 30 tracks of an artist but then I got to thinking that the only artists I can think of where I know their whole discography intimately enough are, well, Eminem, Modest Mouse and, erm, Aerosmith. Heh. So it's one of those three or a list of some kind or I can just fuck off and keep doing the thing. I haven't decided yet. I'm so goddamn hyped for lather games. Shit. I can't wait for the pics. And the shit posting. Probably some drinkin' and some fightin'. (Maybe some fuckin', *wink* *wink.*)\n\nI think it's gonna be a good time. And we deserve it.\n\nYou know?",

It's less sweet, and more heavy than Le Piment. The scent strength is stronger as well. I'm not sure I could pick out any particular notes, but that probably speaks more to my nose than anything else.\n\nIt was a rare hard pass from my wife though. She got strong notes of alcohol and disinfectant from it.\n\nI guess I'll call this a split decision. Two very interesting scents, but neither of them jumped out at me right away as a must buy.\n\nHave a great Tuesday all!",

      "body": "Razor: Karve with OC C plate\n\nBlade: Nacet (24)\n\nBrush: 24mm custom tuxedo\n\nLather: T&S Sicily\n\nPost: T&S Sicily AS\n\nAnother chilly morning so went with something more savory. I love the complexity of this scent. It is layered very well and everyone plays nicely in the sandbox. I love walking past the den and just cracking open this soap for a deep sniff.\n\nSwitched back to the OC C plate for today's shave for something slightly less aggressive. It was a good switch. I love both the OC C and D plates. Having a few plates that work really well for me make me really appreciate this razor.\n\nThe blade is still going strong and smooth as I near the quarter century mark. Not even close to 100, but much closer than my last few blades. I'm not going to retire this blade any time soon.\n\nGotta love a BBS morning.\n\nHappy Tuesday!",

Also, the technique of rubbing the shave stick against the lather bowl seemed to suffice, just skimming enough off the top and bits of soap accumulating on each ridge around the whole bowl. So today in an effort to expedite it, I used a wet brush, and this time probably too wet. Couldn't get past the foam stage, and when I tried shaving with it (was far too thin), it was skip and drag and all sorts of non-slickness from the lather. Hit the reset button, tried it again, and I got a good lather similar to yesterday's shave. Didn't play around with it trying to get it slicker, at this point I was already behind schedule, and the lather was good enough to do the job. What I'm learning is this soap is a finicky mistress and I hope she's worth it.\n\nLife is short, shave with good gear.",

I was deliberating between this one and the hammered, and although the latter looked the most grippy, there was a certain \"je ne sais quoi\" that drew me to the maze (few SOTD pictures may also have been responsible). If it shaves half as good as it looks, I'll be a happy camper. I also now understand what people meant by the handle feeling small in the hand. My Karve handle is also 3', but feels much more robust. Will be interesting to see whether I grow to like it.\n\nWhat I do like is this Grizzly Bay handle. The trademark flutes make it so comfortable to hold, and the \"crushed\" brushes in particular have a lot of character to them. Although I tend to er more towards minimalism when it comes to brush design, John's pieces manage to be eye catching without being gaudy. Given how quickly his drops sell out, I don't think he needs my mediocre promotion 🤷\n\nTwo more finals and I can taste the sweet elixir of freedom... Have a good one!",

I'd forgotten about this need until I went to shave, so I just grabbed the closest razor I had to hand and damn is it milder than I remember! I had to buff quite a bit of areas compared to what I've been doing lately, but my face really doesn't feel nearly as irritated, so it's a win I suppose. Oh and to mention the software, even though Spicebomb is normally more of a cooler weather scent, I think the sweetness that's inherent gives it the versatility needed to use it this time of year. I'm just not sure how much hotter it can get before I put the Kaboom away for the summer.",

The resin is well poured and the shape is super comfortable, the knot has some pretty good backbone which I personally like for my face lathers.\n\nI feel like I had the soap dialed in today perfectly, just so much damn glide in this soap it should be called Slicarus. I honestly couldn't tell if the razor was cutting on my first pass and during the buffing it felt as if there was still lather on my face. Just a great shave today!\n\nHave a good one everybody!!",

Afterwards the smell is more an industrial lemon soap. Not great smelling, but lathers very well and gives a nice shave. Not bad for < $2!",

It blooms in a more deeper and layered way than it is just off the sample. Very enjoyable.\n\nFirst feather blade and yup - it's sharp. This might be in the too sharp category for me but I'm going to see if it settles in after a few more shaves. Right now favorite blade is the Gillette green so when it's time to order more i will probably be heavy on those and try a few others. Maybe some more Gillettes and a polsilver or something.\n\nHappy Tuesday. Make it kick Monday's sorry rear end.",

Fantastic stuff. I may even need to grab the regular D&G Light Blue, or at least get a sample to compare to the Stromboli edition, which has been one of my go-to summer scents for years. I may or may not have been quite tired before shaving, and forgetting how soft the M&M soaps are, jammed my brush into the tub, and picked up way too much soap. Thankfully, I was able to return most of the excess soap to the tub without issue. Though this stuff is way softer than almost anything that's not sold as a cream, it is a great performer. M&M is certainly one of the best values on the market tight now.",

Since going down the rabbit hole I haven't went back to my Stirling samples much but decided to give them a go again this morning. For the price they really are tough to beat but I've definitely noticed a slight step down in terms of slickness and post shave from some of the heavy hitters. I'm trying to get my brother into wet shaving so I may give him a few samples that aren't getting love but I'll be mixing them from time to time.",

This soap was created for the forum \"Sin Corte No Hay Gloria\" based in Spain. The artwork was created by forum members and then voted upon by the members; it was a very fun process.\n\nThe soap smells superb, a nice greenish tea type scent that is very appealing and actually smells stronger when lathered. This soap is extremely slick, great residual slickness, and a very nice post shave. I really enjoyed this morning's shave.",

I put a little too much pressure in one of the passes, but no major cuts, so all is well.\n\nI still find this one of the more fascinating scents that I own. Every time I use it the smell seems a little different, so I find myself smelling the puck randomly to try and pull all the pieces out. Normally I don't notice the \"Jazz Cigarette\" smell but today it was fairly apparent with the orchid and incense.\n\nAnyway, hope everyone has a wonderful day.",

Same gap, much better results. An easy two pass BBS, about the same mild blade feel. Stumbling block for the Timeless remains the 100mm handle, which lacks the balance of other 4 inch handles I've used, and is also very slick when wet due to the lovely but impractical plaid pattern on the handle, which makes it devoid of grip points. The razor works better with handles from other brands. (I've not bought any Timeless handles to replace the Plaid, as they seem a bit overpriced,)\n* **Soap**: Don't like the scent much. The Eufros vegan base here also seems to work less well (protection, post shave feel) than that same Eufros base in the Tierra Humeda scent, a product for which I do like the scent. Is this psychology or some variance in the base formula between one example and another? Dunno, but Gea is going away for a long time after a mediocre shave comfort performance and that polarizing scent.",

      "body": "**May 21, 2019**\n\n\n**Brush:** Ever Ready F40 / 24mm faux horse\n**Razor:** Maggard V3A\n**Blade:** Gillette Nacet\n**Lather:** Declaration Grooming cream tester\n**Post Shave:** [Declaration Grooming - Unscented - Liniment](https://trythatsoap.com/collection/897/?product_type=liniment)\n**Fragrance:** [Australian Private Reserve - Fougère Trois - Eau De Parfum](https://trythatsoap.com/collection/1155/?product_type=edp2)\n\nToday I used the last of my Declaration cream test sample. After initially not being all that impressed with it (admittedly due to my general lack of experience with creams and over watering it), the 3 subsequent shaves were much, much better. Starting with a damp brush and adding water slowly yields a thick creamy bison-like lather with top tier slickness and surprisingly good post shave for a cream. Two of the shaves I tested this by not using any post shave product and my face never felt dried out. Pretty amazing because I have naturally dry skin.\n\nThe scent is a mix of citrus and soft floral to my nose and seems very fitting for this time of year. Another thing that struck me is how long the scent sticks around. Usually the soap scent is gone right after rinsing it off, but this I can detect hours later.\n\nFougere Trois is a new fragrance in my den thanks to /u/Ythin. I was able to snag a decant of the EdP that he was offering last week. It's a wonderful take on the fougere genre, probably the best I've ever smelled. It reminds me of Reserve Fern, but is brighter and less powdery/creamy so it takes it out of that \"old man\" realm.\n\nAll in all, a great shave was had and I'm feeling and smelling awesome today. Such a great time to be a wetshaver with all of these excellent products and scents to enjoy. Happy Tuesday all!",

Some weeks back there was a thread about brush preferences, and I chimed in that the limited money I use on wet shaving goes to software since I don't want to get in the habit of spending big bucks on badger brushes. Outside of my original Art Of Shaving badger (which wasn't very good) I've gotten by with a cheap Omega boar and a cheap Stirling synthetic. /u/ugmug sent me a message offering to PIF a brush that had been PIF'd to him by /u/mammothben - one that started his love for a great badger brush. After multiple attempts badgering him (ha) to let me pay him something for it, we settled on a donation to [RestoreNYC](https://restorenyc.org/) to help fight sex trafficking.\n\n/u/mammothben - First, thank you for PIF'ing this brush in the first place! Second, are you able to provide some details about it?\n\nThe shave itself was excellent. In honor of Will re-launching 42 in the new soap and aftershave bases, I figured I would use my Glissant/Tonique set today and finish it off with the EdT. The brush has incredibly soft tips while still meeting my desire for a strong backbone. It built an awesome lather and set up a *great* shave.\n\nHappy Tuesday shaves, all!",

Yesterday I got in the mail two loaner razors. Reg's PILS and and Hyv's Wolfman MR2. Talk about first world problems, having to decide what to shave with first?\n\nUltimately I went with the Wolfman and secretly I hoped that it wouldn't live up to the hype but it looks like it might. It's still a first impression, but the shave itself was very close with nice blade feel and a easy angle to hit the sweet spot. Knowing that as my familiarity with a razor gets better the shaves usually do to, I'll be interested to see how this guy performs in a week or two.\n\nIn other news, I'm in some ICS training today. It's death by PowerPoint, but there worse ways to spend the days I suppose. Chugging through the day. I know it's important to have the grounding for when an emergency like a Hurricane or Earthquake happens, but in my experience, most people who arnt first responders lose the trees through the forest when it comes to disaster response.\n\nRobot",

A little goes a long way and it initially reminded me of the Chatillon Lux toner, but it sinks into the skin and doesn't leave an oiliness like the CL toner. My face feels really great, like I don't think I've had a splash like this before.\n\nThe scent is really strong. Sharp lemon, sparkling ginger. And florals in the back.

The shave to compare others to. Not BBS as I don't see that happening with my neck, but super close and comfortable after 2 passes. No additional clean up passes needed on neck and no accidental cuts or nicks. Had a week of growth coming in to make sure my face was plenty healed up. Took my time to ensure good results.\n\nLather game was a bit off last night, but I suspect I just didn't pick up enough soap initially to deal with all the extra hair on my face.",

Decided I didn't care for the 100mm handle, and swapped to a shorter 85mm handle that came with my RR Game Changer .68. While this razor is not as efficient as the GC .84, I do appreciate that the steeper blade angle seems to do better on some of my hard-to-reach spots (under the jawline). Either way, got a nice clean BBS in 3 passes with no nicks.",

Let's whip it out and enjoy!\n\n#### ❧ Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Gibbs - No. 17 Adjustable Setting 3 ::: Gillette - 7 o'clock - Ylw Gibbs ‹4 uses›)*\n\nThis little razor blew through 1.5 days growth like it was nothing. This 7 o'clock SharpEdge Yellow worked very well in it for me.\n\nNo tugging or irritation.\n\n#### ❧ Soap Notes\n*^(Barrister and Mann Reserve - Fougere Gothique)*\n\nOne of my favorite all time soaps/scents!!!\n\nScent Elements from Them: Lavender, Oakmoss, Bergamot, Geranium, Sandalwood, Smoke, Mushroom, Ash, Tonka Bean, Fir, Vetiver, Cedar, Musk, Leather, Tuberose\n\nScent: I was able to pick out the Cedar, Fir, Smoke/Ash, and Bergamot. This has many ingredients, but they were all mixed with such finesse that you wouldn't know it.\n\nScent Strength: 4-5/10, lightly present during shaving.\n\nLather: I mixed it thin, so I never got creamy, but it was nice to use and did the job with ease. Super slick.\n\nI really like the Reserve base. It's silky creamy, and even if you overload it with water, it performs. Probably one of my top 2 bases.\n\n30 second load with lightly-wet boar brush + 3 tsp water = 3 passes of lather + just a little for touch-up.\n\nBowl - I used the XL version of this bowl:\nhttps://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3392930\n\n#### ❧ Brush Notes\n*^(Zenith - B10 Boar Red‹14 uses›)*\n\nIt's surprising that this little brush is so comfortable when not a lot of the tips have split. It enjoyable to use, and has just the right amount of backbone for me, Medium-ish.\n\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Smooth\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Cut flush to where I just see the tips (above average for me)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm)\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

I am going to be shaving with a unobtanium razor thanks to /u/Hyvasuomi79, Aftershave that was a gift from /u/Rainbow_65 and shave with a Unicorn Ivory Brush that came from /u/Soullesssingularity. None of this would have been possible without the amazing community here on /r/WetShaving and I'm greatful to be part of it.\n\nI realized I haven't shaved with Panda in a long time. Camel has been on my list to look for but it never came to fruition. Panda is odd. It's green and has this sort of Asian Fougere-Musk accord to it. It's not unpleasant but I honestly can't think of anything else like it on the market. As someone who loves Fougeres, I plan to use it sparingly.\n\nIn other news I just finished out another project. This one was photography related and that makes two projects off my plate. I've been trying to work ahead of sked the last month so that I would have some free time ahead of the Maggards meet up and then the Lather Games. I was thinking today about the games and the idea about trading.\n\nI honestly believe anyone could go into the games this year with 2-3 jars of soap and have a wonderful experience, thanks to trading and isnt that really what the games are supposed to be about? (That and shit posting) but in all seriousness, it's a chance for us to have some laughs and perhaps try some new products and hardware in a way they fosters the community and that's great.\n\nY'all have a good day.\n\nRobot\n\n\nRobot)",

Very soft out of the tub, but overall an easy lather. The scent is very pleasant, a fresh, clean, soapy cologne smell that's sure to be a crowd pleaser. The balm isn't as quick to dry as Stirling or Lisa's, but does rehydrate the skin and leave it soft and supple.",

I actually could have possessed the V1 version of this from the take-2/leave-2, as it was donated from Cody midway through the trip. I felt guilty taking it after it was literally just put in. Plus I took coffee so that would have been 3 items. Anyways, I gave it a test run before sending it on the way, but ever since then I knew I needed a set of my own.\n\nSo here we are, I actually got the soap 6 months ago from the Secret Santa exchange, and I picked up the AS around March. The performance was exactly as I remember, thirsty, slick, user-friendly. I like the scent, but if I were to rank the NO scents, I would still put Lonestar and Flying Hide in front of it. I think in the past, I held it in such high regard because it was supporting a new brand, the performance was excellent, and it was a sub exclusive. I'm feeling a bit like Thanos, where reality did not quite live up to the memory or expectation. Lonestar though, I need a set of that.\n\nLife is short, shave with good gear.",

I'm not sure. But I finally feel like I really have this down. For the longest time I was only shaving a few times a week, but lately, I've been able to go every other day real easily, with basically zero irritation. Feelsgoodman. I do plan on snagging a new razor here in the next few months, looking to snag an open comb. Luckily, as much as i'm addicted to new smells and software, I haven't ever really gotten that bug to acquire tons of hardware.",

      "body": "Soap: Declaration Sweet Lemon\n\nBrush: Declaration Shipwreck\n\nRazor: Rockwell 6C\n\nBlade: Perma Sharp\n\nPost: Declaration Sweet Lemon splash; Declaration unscented liniment\n\nToday is my 40th birthday (and my wedding anniversary but that's a story for another day). I've been thinking about this day a lot for several months now. I suppose big life milestones cause you to reflect and take stock of your life where you stand. Mostly, I'm grateful to be where I am. I have a lot to be thankful for: a great family, good health, a steady job, good friends and many other things that make me feel fortunate. So, here's a few thoughts as I commemorate this occasion.\n\nA few years ago, I felt like I was engaged in the same work/kid/sleep routine each day. I felt like I needed to find a hobby to bring something different to my life, and that would break up the monotony a bit. I found wetshaving by happenstance. I had always been a sort-of-satisfied electric razor user, and had basically resigned myself to putting up with mild irritation on my neck and jawline as a normal thing. When my electric razor broke, I did a Google search for \"ways to eliminate razor burn,\" intending to find another model of electric razor that would take care of this, and began reading various articles. I was introduced to the wetshaving world-a world that I don't think I even knew existed. My grandfather used an electric razor, and my father uses cartridges. I started reading all about wetshaving, and watched some YouTube videos too. I bought the Maggard kit, like so many of us, and the rest is history.\n\nShaving changed from something that I had to do each day to avoid looking like a 14 year old boy with a whispy mustache (darn genetics) to something I enjoyed doing just for me. I don't really have a lot of time in my daily routine to do many things for myself, so the 15 minutes I spend each morning shaving and caring for myself have really enriched my life. Like many of us, I started with just a few products, but before I knew it I had a whole collection of soaps, aftershaves, razors and brushes. At one point my wife jokingly said to me: \"who are you\"? Well, my answer is, this is me, and I'm proud of finding something that I have to look forward to each day. I've found something I truly enjoy, and it's made my life fuller.\n\nAside from finding a hobby I enjoy, I also made friends on this sub. Without naming name, you know who you are. So many people have been extraordinarily kind, generous and understanding. I want to give a special shout-out to all of my friends on IRC, and for the many, many laughs that I've had each day. If you're not joining us on IRC, you're missing out on one of the best parts of this sub. So, please join us, and come have a good time!\n\nWhile this sounds like a resignation letter, unfortunately for all of you, I'm not going anywhere. My reign of terror will continue until deposed, or until I get tired of it and resign, whichever is first. I think this is the best community on the internet, and I am thankful to each of you who contribute, donate, and otherwise make this a special place. Happy shaving.",

It has more background information that I was interested in finding out about. Kind of like a \"pull the curtain down\" and get a take a glimpse of the High Table. For me, it was a great follow-up to 1 and 2. Recommend viewing for fans of the first two movies. Great Wednesday shaves to all.",

It's woody and leathery and there's something sweet about it. I was getting a slight smoky scent off the brush. Performance was perfect. It's very slick and I can do whatever I want with the razor. This little Omega boar holds the perfect amount of lather for me. This is the kind of shave that I'm always after.\n\n\nI wanted to keep the theme going with Aoud Leather EdP. \"Aoud Leather incorporates a warm of the leather note with spices, citrus and amber.

It lathers easily and the post-shave feel always impresses me. I really enjoy this scent as well.\n\nI'm not sold on the MLS pre-shave yet. It's oily, which is alright, but I find it's sticky and the lathers does seem to stick to it a little bit on the first pass. I don't think this might be optimal as I noticed that I skipped a few patches of hair on my cheek for the first pass. Not an area I usually skip over.\n\nThe Maol Grooming AS is fantastic. This one had a lovely menthol effect after it and my skin just feels so smooth and good. My skin is still feeling great this morning, even after a morning face-wash. This is a great product.\n\nThe Nacet blade is going strong and feels very smooth. I feel it's not as sharp as it was at first but I don't think that's an issue for the 3-pass shave.\n\nIs it the end of the week yet?! Gotta love short, post-long weekend weeks. Happy Wednesday folks!",

This one went better than the last one, but I still didn't see any magic happen. The two scents played nice together, but it was a swift transition and not one that I could really appreciate over time EWalk smelled a lot better than I remembered it, I enjoyed it quite a bit. Nefertiti is growing on me and I think it might be best suited for me as an aftershave product. So, idk, I'll probably continue to experiment with mismatched shaves from time to time but I think I also have to just accept my nose's prudish ways and that matched sets are my favorite thing.",

I had thought it was heavy vanilla, but vanilla isn't listed, so it was something else. I used the AS/EDP combo a couple times a few months back and unloaded the aftershave, defeated, because i do love me some sandalwood....I was going through a drawer last night and realized I still have the EDP sample and gave it a shot this morning, and i really dig it. I don't think I had ever tried the EDP without the aftershave....So score. I totally see now why Shawn does some things in EDT/P only, and tweaks some for aftershaves, and doesn't do some in soaps....While I do think I like the Santal Auster in EDP form, in aftershave it just didn't do it for me.",

I've never had a bad shave with it, it's high quality and the scents are quite nice even if they're on the subtle side. The higher price will prevent it from having a consistent spot in my soap collection once the 1802 and Grafton are gone, but the quality and performance are right up there with the best I've tried.\n\nI've also decided that I need a new razor and brush. There's nothing wrong with the ones I have, I just want something different. I have an idea for a custom brush that I would like to present to u/Phteven_j sometime, but with his schedule being taken up by the Gatsby theme releases going on I will give him some time to settle down a bit first.",

Anyway, in honor of Try That Soap's proprietor, I decided to let Try That Soap choose my shave this morning. Luckily, the algorithm spat out a perfectly acceptable pairing.

Today I used what I think is my favourite brush so far and I achieved a very slick and protective lather. The soap performance is out of this world and my face was left feeling smooth and lightly scented.\nThe aftershave continues to impress me, I always add an unscented balm or skin salve after applying any alcohol based AS but with this one I don't feel like I need to. My face doesn't feel itchy or dried and the scent is mild but I can still smell it. The honey is not at all overpowering and instead complements the other notes really well.\nNefertiti is quickly becoming one of my favourites sets in my den.",

      "body": "Wednesday 5/22 SOTD\n\n* Razor: Timeless SS 0.68 SB w 100mm \"Plaid\" handle\n* Blade: Bolzano (4)\n* Brush: 24mm RazoRock 2 band badger in barrel handle\n* Soap: Eufros Cronos tallow base\n* Post: B&M Reserve Cool splash\n* Frag: Lauder Devin EDC\n\nProduct Notes:\n\n* **Razor / Blade**: Combo works nicely. The Bolzano is mild enough to not give any irksome irritation yet also shaves well enough in the 0.68 to give an easy 7 to 10 hour BBS in two passes. The long relatively unbalanced and non-grippy handle on the Timeless continue to be an irritant, but not a major one as my hands are usually dry during a shave and the balance point is not too hard to find and keep.\n* **Brush**: This one was dirt cheap at Pasteur's, possibly mispriced at $15, but holds up well. A bit of bloom makes it look like a 26mm, but creation and flow through is excellent. Face feel and backbone are well balanced. Brush lost no hairs but has a few horizontally oriented stragglers that make it look a tad less nice than the the Stirling 24mm fan, which remains my go to recommendation for cheap badgers. But this is still a very nice brush with the relatively unusual barrel shape handle.\n* **Soap**: Eufros tallow, used a day after Eufros vegan, shows its advantage prominently. Great shave, interesting scent, though maybe not quite worth the price elevation over the costly enough base Eufros tallow price. Uses some exotic EOs, probably not really necessary, especially as the end result scent is somewhat less appealing than other Eufros all-FO based scents. Still, a unique scent, and a creative and unconventional artisan, so hard to grouse too much.\n* **Post**: My favorite B&M splash. Scent is fine, but the moderate amount of menthol is the selling point. The alcohol and menthol shut down the Incredible Hulk pain sensors in the face for a bit, and then when the visage wakes up later, it's back to mild, calm Dr. Banner. For me personally, if every post shave had menthol in it, I would be a happy camper.",

For my birthday shave I had originally set out my full Seville set, but made a change this AM to Executive Man and Aventus - one of my favorite scents and the one that first got me into wet shaving about two and a half years ago.\n\nSince I had the benefit of a 9:30 AM meeting near my house, I could take my time with no longer commute today and have a relaxing shave. For the first time in a long time I bowl lathered with [this guy](https://photos.app.goo.gl/aH6ux5SHAJsZx1zGA), and actually found that I left my lather a bit under hydrated. I think I've turned the corner to realizing that I'm a full time face lather guy. Not only is it quicker, but you get a better feel for when your lather is at the proper place. I'll probably still use the bowl to lather samples, but I don't think much more than that.\n\nThe shave itself was nice and Aventus was a great scent to carry into this morning meeting.\n\nLooking forward to a relaxing night with my wife to celebrate tonight. Happy Wednesday shaves, all!",

They offer some of the most unique scents in the shave-dom. Some of them I really like - Sherlock, Summer Storm, and Midnight stag. I love GTB too, but it burns my face. From the website - Scent is made of the following notes: Russian Leather, Motor Oil, Hoppes #9, Birch Tar, Oakmoss, Gasoline, Smoke, Cedar, Cade, Bergamont, Vanilla. I really really love this - it kinda smells like a car workshop - but in a good way. I mostly get Motor Oil, some gasoline, a little bit of smoke and a mixture of everything else. There is some sweetness in the scent, which, imo, balances everythign else very well. I guess the background sweetness comes from Vanilla? I can see lots of people hating it, but I love it. I won't wear a frag that smells like this - but this is another of my 30 minutes pleasure thing. I would say scent strength is mid-strong to strong. The scent remains strong while lathered and your bathroom will smell like it for an extended period.\n\n\nUnfortunately, the scent is where my love for this soap ends. Oh wait, price - I love the price too, especially the price of this tub - I picked it up at a massive discount. Where this soap doesn't perform exceptionally is performance. I am not talking about 'I can't use this' type of performance. I could use it for the rest of my life - but compared to most soaps I have, this performs noticeably poorly. For reference, before this soap (last three days), I used Icarus Shore - with which I have absolutely 0 problems. Not only that, I rate about [15 other soaps](https://i.imgur.com/tAcPxHl.png) as top tier - I am not particularly elitist when it comes to soap performance.\n\nThis soap is fairly easy to lather - I use a relatively wet brush, load a lot, take the brush to my face and lather. I add close to 0 water after loading. This base kinda hates water and loses its consistency with more water. This is where I have to be a bit careful - almost every other soap/cream in my den requires more water than this. I don't see this as a good or bad thing - just a feature. I am fine with it, never had any problem lathering CFG.\n\nLather doesn't become dry or thin over the course of three full passes. I find the lather slick - not the slickest maybe, but definitely slick enough. If I don't do any buffing/ minor passes without lather, this is soap is perfectly fine. And that is where my displeasure with CFG base comes - I do buff, not a lot, but quite a bit - especially while shaving the chin area, and few parts of the neck. Regardless of what razor I use, DE or straight, I feel a genuine lack of residual slickness with this soap. As if every pass removes all lather and lather-like goodness from my skin. It feels like I washed my face with lots of water. And because of this, buffing strokes make the shave rather less enjoyable. I have tried loading significantly more - didn't really improve the situation. I even tried adding little water at a time - but the lather fails with regular (wrt other soaps) amount of water - so I have to use less. This has been my observation regarding CFG base over the course of the last two years and numerous usage. I simply don't enjoy the shaves with CFG as much as I do with my other soaps/creams (well except proraso).\n\nImmediately after the shave, I never felt any dryness - my face feels nice and hydrated. I should say, I never tested without any post-shave products either.\n\nNow, why am I caring that much about the performance now, after all these years? Because I have found a soap/scent that can replace my love for Midnight Stag - Valley of Ashes. They aren't the same, but close enough and I prefer SW V2 base by a noticeable margin. So I am trying to justify offloading a soap base I don't like but a scent I love. Hence, I am trying to figure out CFG base (again) without any luck. Thanks a lot for reading.\n\nPurchased everything with my own $$$",

WTG, XTG, and ATG clean ups. A little rough towards the end but a clean BBS shave nonetheless. The razor & blade felt aggressive but that was expected. Soap and brush lathered up fantastically. Post shave really tightened the skin and moisturized it for the entire day.\n\n**The Soap** worked well. I'm learning to enjoy the scent as I shave more with it. It's a great sweet, powdery scent that reminds me of an old fashioned barbershop. Rod did some great work with this one. It lathered well and performed excellently. It does take a while to clean it off but I really can't complain about that, haha.\n\n**The Razor and Blade** combination worked well. The blade is slightly rough and the Personna Lab Blue tends to be like that. The first couple shave were a lot better but as I push it, it's getting rougher. Still no nicks or weepers but it did scrape my skin a bit more than usual. I'll give it one more use and decide on the blade. But overall, a clean and efficient shave that was a bit rough but not enough to call it bad.\n\n**The Brush** felt great. This 26mm brush is dense and lathers up so well. It feels like a ball but it still has that synthetic feel to it. Sometimes, it does become flimsy and resistant so that's that. However, the handle feels so nice and the overall impression of this brush is great. As a synthetic, it performs well so let's keep it at that!\n\n**The aftershave portion** was great. The Alum Block felt rough. I felt stinging all over my mustache, chin, and neck. It's not the fault of the alum block but the aggressive shave of Gillette Old Type + Personna Lab Blue. Anyhow, finishing with the Stirling Executive Man Balm definitely calmed down the skin and made my skin glistening for the whole day.\n\nOverall, the shave was great. You can't go wrong with any Stirling products unless your skin is allergic to lanolin / you don't like the scent. Anyhow, great brush to go with the soap. Coming from the luxurious finest badger, the synthetic felt a bit unnatural. Regardless of that, it gave me great lather to work with. Now the razor & blade was efficient but rough. I felt the stings with the alum block. My face was okay but my skin was slightly irritated. I'll try one more shave with the razor combo when I get another heavy growth. Ended with a great post shave so I was glad at the end. Tomorrow, I'll go with milder setup, probably the MR1 with Amici soap. I want to use the same brush to get used to the synthetic feel as well.",

South wind 5 to 10 mph. High tide at 3:35 this afternoon.\n\nExcellent on theme shave this morning. Was going through the bins trying to find something to match this theme and came across this tub of Mike's that doesn't see a lot of love from me. Performance is very nice. Slick, and cushiony but not overly cushiony. Residual slickness, just after a pass is a bit lacking, but if you splash some water on, it's there in bounds, so that was me probably under-hydrating the lather. Even though I did under-hydrate it was still slick.\n\nColbeck is nice. The one issue that I have with this is the bottle originally had a metal cap that had rusted and was just a mess to get on and off without getting stuff everywhere. Luckily the bottle matches up with the bottle of Fine splash that I killed off, so I was able to just switch that top. I'm not sure it he's changed the bottle, or the cap for more recent runs. It's a very nice, menthol heavy, scent and one that comes out quite a bit during the summer.\n\nHave a nice Thursday everyone!",

After working the previous evening, and then pulling an all nighter before taking 2 finals, I came home and crashed as badly as Richard Hammond when he drives supercars. Managed not to eat dinner or shave, so I had a solid two days growth to mow down, which is pretty rare for me these days.\n\nThe Personna I had in the CG was tuggy, and I was going to be damned if I let my first shave post stress relief be uncomfortable. I popped in a new Gillette Platinum, and it was smooth sailing from there. The menthol kick from Fern Concerto hit the spot, and I so glad I didn't get rid of this soap. I am still not a menth head by any stretch, but call me a convert. Also really enjoying this handle. Functional work of art is the perfect way to describe it.\n\nHappy shaves on this thankful Thursday!",

This was my first use of 88 Chestnut St. (or Fourth and Pine) and I think I'm really going to like the scent for spring and summer. So... when I purchased 88 Chestnut St. off the Bazaar it was listed as a post shave toner. The ingredients show no alcohol, the stuff comes out thick like the toners do, and there was no alcohol burn on my face... but curiously, the [front label reads aftershave](https://photos.app.goo.gl/27rygsKAcTrfMZft7), not post shave toner. Did you change up the labeling for the toners, /u/hawns?\n\nIn any case, great shave, great post shave, great morning. Happy Thursday all!\n\nEdit: Didn't even look at the theme today, but apparently what I chose fits the bill. Very nice!",

After reading about it, I thought this was going to possibly be the be all, end all of GEMs....Maybe it will be, but it'll take more uses. First use thoughts, most similar to MMOC, but a little bit more blade feel, but also with a bit of easier glide and thus more comfortable. Because the top is a bit rounded instead of straight, finding the angle wasn't as easy as typical GEMs, but I think I got the hang of it. Will use again very soon for sure.\n\nI enjoyed Santal Auster so much yesterday, back to it today, with the first soap/AS I saw that would go with it.",

I generally don't shave everyday but after seeing this brush waiting for me in the mailbox, I had to give it a try. One shave might be a little early to judge but the first shave was fantastic. Plenty of backbone but soft tips - it releases lather easily and paints it on smoothly. I find that the density of the knot also allows for lather to be whipped up easily.\n\nThere still is a bit of badger funk and the lather does get a tinge of brown to it but nothing that hampered my shave. I absolutely loved the shave.\n\nNow what do I do with all the other brushes I have?! Some are going to have to make their way to the S_B. I think I am now convinced that the two band/finest/best badger is my go to rather than silvertip, which just doesn't have enough backbone for my liking.\n\nThe Stirling Bergamot Lavender is a lovely, strong scent that lingers quite a bit. Actually is a nice, bright summer scent iMO and the menthol in the AS completed the cool feel summer scent.\n\nIf only the weather could get better... Happy Thursday folks!",

I'm fairly certain this tub came in a lot I got off of the bazaar last year. It's a nice enough scent if you like mint and the lather definitely falls into the \"perfectly serviceable\" category. And I figured since we're celebrating the proximity of summer by freezing ourselves, I'd also give cold-water shaving a try. Gotta say, I was not a fan. It's not so much that it was too cold on my skin as I just didn't like how cold it was on my hands. Rinsing the razor in cold water and holding a cold razor just wasn't comfortable. I'll probably give it at least one more try for science, but I don't see myself converting to cold-water shaving.",

However with it being the theme day I selected my own soaps. Speaking of impressed, the new base from SBS is fantastic and I found the Lather to be richer and slicker from the V1.\n\nIn other news, the reason why I picked Cannonball is because today is my son's first swim lesson. Sadly in my line of work I've seen too many children get hurt or die because of not knowing how to swim and a long time ago I swore that my children would always know how to swim.\n\nI'm about to walk into the pool now and get started with the lesson. Y'all have a great day!\n\nRobot",

Life is too short, PIFing this soap to an IRC member.\n\nBurnish is an interesting scent - a bit menthol heavy, but I like it quite a bit.",

Keeping on with my loaner Gibbs razor, and now trying it with one of my two go-to budget blades. But the star of the show for me was the Formula T base from WSP. It is nigh-top-tier for me for sure. The feel and slickness and creaminess even while being hydrated well were just superior. Samples can be had for $5 or so, which is not super cheap. But I say give the Formula T a try in whatever scent you think you'd like.\n\n#### ❧ Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Gibbs - No. 17 Adjustable Setting 3 ::: Derby - Gibbs ‹1 uses›)*\n\nExcellent shave today. So today was a jaunt into trying budget blades in the Gibbs. And the Derby did very well. I would not have a problem if I was stuck with that combo for a very long time. Tomorrow, I'll try the Wilkinson Sword, most likely.\n\n#### ❧ Soap Notes\n*^(WSP Formula T - Barbershop)*\n\nScent: A nice, even-keeled barbershop, without having powder or floral as overly-dominant notes ... something I was glad about.\n\nScent Strength: 4/10, lightly present during shaving.\n\nLather: This Formula T base is really knocking on the door of the top-tier with its creaminess, slickness, and elasticity. Rinses were luxurious, and the lather was beautiful. Razor had plenty of glide and the shave was very close. I like the Rustic base okay, but this one is much better. So good that I will likely skip the samples from their site, and maybe order one soap a month of all the scents I think I might like.\n\n40 second load with lightly-wet large-ish badger brush 4.5 x tsp water = 6 passes of lather. Obviously, I'll reduce that.\n\nBowl - I used the XL version of this bowl:\nhttps://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3392930\n\n#### ❧ Brush Notes\n*^(Stirling - Finest in CravingShaving Blue Slate 26mm‹5 uses›)*\n\nI let it soak for several hours prior to shave, to see if that would relax the knot a little. I think it did. It was softer and had a little less backbone than previous. I hope it lets go just a little more.\n\nThe first pass was on 2 days of growth, so I didn't go into the splay and stayed with the tips. I think that's a good plan from here on out. Maybe the bristles, in splay, get caught up on the longer-than-usual whiskers. I dunno. So first pass was with nice soft tips, and the subsequent ones were in splay and were comfortable, but just a bit too much backbone still. But hey, it's young.\n\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Smooth\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Cut flush to where I just see the tips (above average for me)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm) *and also in the sub's sidebar.*\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

      "body": "**May 23, 2019 - Summer Time Chill Shave: On Theme**\n\n\n**Brush:** WCS Synth\n**Razor:** Razorock GameChanger .68\n**Blade:** Astra Platinum (5)\n**Lather:** B&M Seville in Reserve with Chiseled Face Cryogen\n**Post Shave:** [Barrister and Mann - Seville - Aftershave](https://trythatsoap.com/collection/27/?product_type=aftershave2)\n**Fragrance:** Ralph Lauren Safari\n\nI need to start by giving credit where credit is due. I think u/CosmoBarber and u/Not_a_robot101 turned me onto the idea that I could combine Cryogen with other soaps to essentially give me unlimited access to mentholated soaps in the warmer months. This makes tremendous sense to me at this point. Recently I've used some older donkey milk WK Fougere Bouquet tubs that I picked up in the Bazaar along with the Cryogen and the shaves were great. I will say that the menthol scent from the Cryogen can overwhelm the other soap if you get overzealous with it. And that's easy to do. The menthol concentration in this stuff is incredible. I don't know how Chiseled Face sells any of this stuff because the one tub I bought is probably enough to last me for the rest of my life.\n\nSo I was considering just using the Fougere Bouquet BUT I really wanted to make sure that I'm on my B&M Reserve lathering game because Saturday I plan to use my newly pieced together set of Fougere Gothique for the first time. So I grabbed my Seville in Reserve and got to work. I may have found one of my new favorite shaves. The menthol note not only fit in with Seville for me but even accentuated it a little bit. I'm sure u/bostonphototourist just face palmed himself if he read that, but to my Neanderthal nose it fit much more seamlessly. Which turned out to be a good thing considering.\n\nI did four passes today. I've thrown an Astra back into the GameChanger just to cycle back through some blades before the Lather Games and to confirm for myself that I'm as set as I'm gonna be for the sh!tshow that is about to ensue. My face does not love constant change between brands and part of me wonders if a few of the r/WickedEdge gory neck shots won't be mandatory for me during the games. At any rate the Astras are plenty smooth but for me to get a similar level of smoothness that I get from the Gillette 7 o'clock Super Platinums I've had to resort to more passes or more buffing or maybe both. The lather today was definitely up to the task and I enjoyed the \"Feels\" of the menthol and the scent I couldn't really help myself.\n\nThe Safari cologne was just for fun. I bought my first bottle in high school or early in college when I ran out of Drakkar Noir. I wore it forever and the wife was nostalgic for it. The Post Office delivered the package last night and I don't know how long this bottle has been collecting dust because I could right away it was still the same stuff. In fact the wife complained that the Seville was overpowering it this morning. I'm not a heavy cologne sprayer.\n\nLastly I want to add a shameless plug for the fact that I'm still looking for some Mammoth soap, any scent, whatever release. Apparently this stuff is cooked on Mars and kept here on earth along with King Soloman's treasure and the remnants of the True Cross in the Illuminati's vault. Or I guess it will be at the Maggard's meet-up... I could also use some Siliski Santa's Pipe and I think there's one more thing I'm looking for to complete my Lather Games run this year. Its been fun to try to piece all this together and I'm looking forward to the Shenanigans. Happy shaves everybody-- at least all you night shavers.",

WTG, XTG, and ATG clean ups. A mild to mid-aggressive setup. The soap worked well but didn't exceed my expectations. The brush felt great again. Mild post shave to calm down the slight skin irritations.\n\n**The Soap** worked well. It's a great value soap that performs great. As a vegan soap, it's a bit thinner than Stirling's but it's slick and creamy for me. I'd say it performs at a average rate but a lot better than the canned goo's out there. The scent is amazing as it has a bit complex citrus/grapefruit notes to it. It's not too dark but somewhere in the middle for me.\n\n**The Razor and Blade** combination worked well. It's a great razor but the blade is heading towards the end of its life. The 1st pass felt great but 2nd and clean up felt a bit rougher. I really need to cut the blade out once it gets to 5th/6th uses as that feels like the tipping point for me. Anyhow, a slight irritation because of the old blade but nothing major. Efficient but a tad rough.\n\n**The Brush** felt great. The dense synthetic feel is still there but I enjoyed it today. Another thing is that water always drips from the base of the knot. I say to myself to start with less water but I always start with too much. Next time, for sure, I'll start with less water. There were flying water and lather everywhere but it performed well. Lovely and beautiful brush that I love to use for any shave.\n\n**The aftershave portion** was great. Mild aftershave setup that calmed down my slightly irritated skin. There were no menthol involved but my skin still felt great afterwards. Even at the end of the day, I can still feel my face moisturized. A small effort can go long ways.\n\nOverall, the shave was great. I used some great products today. Good value soap with awesome artisan brush. Comfortable razor with old blade (I threw the blade after the shave). But as a result, my face was clean and I reduced most of the stubble. Not a BBS but pretty close. For tomorrow, I'm thinking of using the Omega 10066 with Siliski Soaps Midnight in Tunisia. That scent is intoxicating.",

Jamestown Gentleman is another scent which just ends up smelling like generic bath soap to me. Expensive, nice bath soap but generic all the same. My wife, who has a better sense of smell than me, got a hint of woodland fauna from it. She is also batting just about 1000 on detecting whether a scent has musk in or not, again unlike me - I can only tell if it's right in my face. (I'm looking at you Wickham Citrus Musk!)\n\nAnyway it's another sufficiently lightly scented soap that I was free to pick and choose the follow up, which at the moment means Unconditional Surrender.\n\nI hadn't looked at the recommendation for Jamestown Gentleman for me on TTS until I went to add my rating for it. My rating was within 0.08 of the recommendation! Of course confirmation bias means I'm much more likely to notice when the recommendation is close to my rating, but a fun correlation nonetheless.\n\nHappy Friday all!",

Violets, green grass, spice and tobacco flower make this beautiful mix that feels clean, green and fragrant. This may be my favorite of the Mammoth soaps today. Admittedly I love green scents but I don't think I'm understating that it's a very, very pleasant scent. No changes to the soap base so it's the same solid performance as you could expect from any of the other Mammoth soaps.\n\nThe violet is fairly prominent in the soap so I choose to use some B&M Tuesday to compliment the soap and add a bit of lavender. It was a really lovely combination and I was very pleased with the shave. I elected to go the classic route as far as hardware went and reached for an open comb Gillette Aristocrat.\n\nY'all have a great Friday!\nRobot\n\n**Edit:** I was wrong, and my first impressions were way off. Violet is more of a background note and the tobacco is front and center. I went back and did a second shave today and this time I used some APR Fenchurch, and it was fantastic. If you like tobacco scented soaps your gonna love this.",

I loved the scent off the puck when I received it, and I didn't recall disliking the scent as I lathered. So I lathered it this morning, and when thinking about it, it is strikingly similar to Seville. Like, so much so that when I went to sniff my collection a few days ago, I took a big whiff of Seville, then a big whiff of Nectar Amissa, and I swear I couldn't smell anything. I'm sure it would've worked in reverse, there were just no major differences detected when your nose was already saturated with the other. The shave went predictably well. Then came the aftershave. It's the aftershave that I'm not a big fan of, and I don't know at the moment what note has become more prominent. Who knows, maybe it's the initial splash I don't like, but it mellows out later in the day? I'm really considering making this my PIF table contribution at the meetup. This is what I was smelling as I wrote Wednesday's SOTD when I ranked Nectar Amissa #3 of NO scents, but I'd say the soap, I'd probably rank #2, just behind Lonestar. Now I feel I need to try the Lonestar AS to see if I feel strongly about that one...\n\nLife is short, shave with good gear.",

The consistency is almost liquid-like when compared to all the other creams I have tried. The performance is quite good and the post shave feel is better than Castle Forbes IMO. The downside is that I need to use more product per shave.\n\nOff to do Friday.",

After using the Icarus base the last five shaves it was nice to switch it up to the old buffalo base. I still do believe this base performs better than icarus, but if buffalo is my number one pick for best soap base then icarus would be second for sure.\n\nAlso, i was super excited that this razor came in the mail today. I've never been lucky enough to score a CG razor but got lucky and snagged one when they posted on the ready to ship. Got the level 2 guard, but now i'm thinking i might peruse the bazaar to see if anyone has a level one up for grabs just to see how they compare.\n\nThe brush is a beauty and the SHD badger from Maggards is fantastic. The best brush at that price range by far. Happy Friday everyone!",

Rejuvenating Serum - Unscented\n**Fragrance:** Houbigant - Fougère Royale\n\nI haven't been getting good lathers lately with the badger brush, and I think I figured out why. I had been loading from a tub that is running low, so all the soap is squished into the center. That works fine for my synthetic brush, but I don't think the badger was loading enough soap. So, i broke out the nearly full tub of Stirling Gentleman (great scent!), and loaded for a little longer than usual. This time, I got a great lather from the badger. Thanks for your tips from yesterday, u/K1986!\n\n\nAlso, the R41 now has me totally spoiled to the great shaves it gives. My 6S can't compete with the quality of shaves. I'm going to keep an eye out for someone selling one of the more aggressive plates for a Karve, because the B plate isn't cutting it any more compared to the R41.\n\nI've also just accepted that the R41 is not a very smooth razor. I've tried a fair amount of different blades at this point, and none are very smooth. Even with the not super smooth razor, I get amazing shaves with very little burn from the alcohol splash I use.",

Also, I seem to be having a mild gout flare up, which makes me less happy. But good shave this morning with the flat bottom tech. It is a very pleasant combination of efficiency and smoothness. It's not going to make me give up any of my other vintage Gillettes, but it's certainly earned a place in my lineup.\n\nGot a bit of a Froot Loops vibe off of the Visions and Revisions aftershave this morning.

It fit the mood perfectly. I went with a fresh 7 O'clock yellow blade and my vintage Gillette, which is such a comfortable shaver. Finished off the shave with Reserve Fern and one spray of Creed Royal Mayfair after feeling inspired from the review on here earlier this week. Happy Friday shaves, all!",

First time shaving back to back days in a long time and it went well. I'll probably keep skipping a day because I really like my sleep haha.\n\nThe Voskhod blades continue to work well for me, I'm glad I bought a 100 pack of them. Got a little tuggy on the last pass so I'm gonna go ahead and swap before the next shave. No sense in pushing it for 7 cents a blade.\n\nHave a Maggard SHD brush coming in the mail today that I'm looking forward to using on Sunday.",

It does open up a bit while lathering but it's just not it for me most days.

The .68 already seemed very efficient to me, but I definitely got more audio feedback from the .84 and sensed that it was shaving closer (though not at the cost of any incremental discomfort). After 3 passes, both sides felt pretty smooth, but I went ahead and did a 4th touch-up pass with the .84 and sure enough, I was picking up some extra stubble mainly on the side of my face that had been shaved with the .68. I also preferred the feel in hand of the barberpole handle that I used with the .84, vs. the HD handle that I had with my .68. It's funny b/c if you had asked me a month ago I had zero complaints about the .68, and I really only purchased the .84 out of curiosity...but I think it's safe to say that the .84 is now the first-string razor in my rotation. Such a great value for the price. I was originally hoping to finish off the dregs of my Mountain Man samples, but it turns out that the last little bit of splash in the sample bottle is hard to get out, so I substituted w/ Stubble Buster Absolutely (complimented by a few sprays of SBS Icy Stare, which I've developed an addiction to). Stubble Buster is another splash that performs well above its price point. My skin feels fantastic and I'm still catching whiffs of the scent, which reminds me a bit of B&M Reserve Classic.",

And true to the hype of this soap, no post shave was needed.\n\n#### ❧ Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Karve - Christopher Bradley OC C Plate ::: Gillette - Silver Blue ‹7 uses›)*\n\nGreat shave. As we move up the plates from the OC A and B to the C, blade feel increases, but it is still controlled and doesn't feel all that aggressive, despite giving me such a close shave. Very happy with this line of base plates!\n\nNo tugging or irritation.\n\n#### ❧ Soap Notes\n*^(Barrister and Mann Excelsior - 42)*\n\nScent: I might describe it as a muted sweet lemon scent, made mature by the tea and florals. I really enjoyed it. A person who doesn't like lemon or florals should not be afraid of this scent. It's a wonderful blend. And one that I continued to enjoy for several minutes after the shave.\n\nScent Strength: 4-5/10, lightly present during shaving.\n\nLather: Very excellent. Smooth, creamy, and awesome. Better than my Vespers try a while back. This shave lived up more to the hype around Excelsior.\n\n40 second load with lightly-wet large-ish badger brush + 5 tsp water = 6 passes of lather.\n\nBowl - I used the XL version of this bowl:\nhttps://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3392930\n\n#### ❧ Brush Notes\n*^(Elite Razor - Manchurian Fan CravingShaving Blue/White 26mm‹6 uses›)*\n\nWill keep using this brush to put some more miles on it. Hoping backbone relaxes a bit more. It may not, just because of its density. It's nice, just not as much as some (in terms of what I'm looking for).\n\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm) *and also in the sub's sidebar.*\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

I just wanted a refreshing shave after a less than desirable start to the weekend, and refreshing it was. I've used it a ton, but I will say that the Parker 94R is a surprisingly aggressive razor. Watch your pressure if your using it with sensitive skin. The AOS products are brutally overpriced, but they are quite nice in their performance. I purchased this balm at one of their brick & mortar stores after having over-imbibed at a bar in Disney Springs. I don't regret it though. I hope you all have satisfying shaves this weekend!",

It'd had been a little while since I used a L'Occitane balm, and I forgot just how moisturising they are.\n\nAlso TIL that Guatamalan quarters are the exact same diameter as the bore of the brush handle I needed a spacer for.\n\nHave a great weekend all!",

I honestly haven't had any desire to use anything else. I'll probably continue trying out different blades to try and find the best fit. Just got The Muse in the mail yesterday, so I was more than excited to use it. I'm a fan of the soap base, it feels very soft on the face while lathering. It's easy to lather and doesn't take a whole lot of extra water to get it going. The Muse is listed as Sea Grass, Citron and Jasmine. To my nose, I get a floral sea air scent. It's a great summer scent that matches well with any fresh fragrances. The post shave is outstanding and the balm doesn't feel greasy and dries very quickly.",

I just received this West Indies set and a Morocco refill, both are the old V2 base. I'd be curious to know how this scent translated in the new V3 base, but I just have a slight preference for V2 performance so I sought it out specifically.\n\nDefinitely a cool take on a bay rum.. There's no clove in the scent, but I get whiffs of it, probably actually from the allspice. The lather is very bay and vetiver forward, whereas the aftershave really brings out the orange and pepper. I've heard that this scent kinda morphs the more you use it, so we'll see what happens. I somehow scored an overfilled tub with almost 150g of soap.",

The OC B was better than I anticipated. It took a little bit to get used to the blade contact (this being my first open comb experience) but it did a great job knocking off the stubble I had in two passes. 42 came in yesterday and I enjoyed the scent and performance. The aftershave left my skin feeling supple with no drying or greasy residue.\n\nYall have a great weekend!",

I'm a Sandalwood junkie, so I had to try this one. Disappointed, I'm afraid. Just too weakly-scented. That seems to be a theme for them with many of their soaps. Great for those who like light scents, though. Also stepping back into my old Feather blade.\n\n#### ❧ Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Wolfman - WR1 Solid Bar .54 Brushed ::: Feather ‹33 uses›)*\n\nIt may be time to relegate this aging Feather to more aggressive razors. A little tuggy on the first pass, so I had to open up the handle angle some, which really helped. This is the Feather that I'm going to marathon, so we'll see how it goes.\n\nPasses 2 and 3 were smooth, and the closeness of the shave was the Feather-standard Excellent.\n\n#### ❧ Soap Notes\n*^(Soap Commander - Ambition)*\n\nThem: \"Sandalwood, Verbena, and Citrus\"\n\nScent: Because it was so weak, the only note that made it to my nose was just a standard woodiness, like cut lumber. I wasn't able to pick up any verbena or citrus.\n\nScent Strength: 3/10, very lightly present during shaving.\n\nLather: I like SC a lot. Very good performance for not being a tallow soap. smooth and slick.\n\n45 second load with lightly-wet long-bristled boar brush + 2.5 tsp water = 3 passes of lather. I'll load for longer next time, or just scoop.\n\nThese long bristles, working in the smaller diameter container of Soap Commander, kinda stayed in the middle and didn't seem to gather as much soap. I think with this brush and tubs like this, I'll scoop next time.\n\nBowl - I used the XL version of this bowl:\nhttps://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3392930\n\n#### ❧ Brush Notes\n*^(Omega - 10098 Boar‹15 uses›)*\n\nScrubby, not really comfortable, but did the job. He's still young, so can't complain.\n\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Cut flush to where I just see the tips (above average for me)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm) *and also in the sub's sidebar.*\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

This soap doesn't disappoint when it comes to cold! My only gripe is, the glacial level of menthol overpowers all other scents in this soap so all i got is a menthol scent. Not a big deal, especially when i need a good face freezing! The aftershave is great as well and i think the synthetic cooling agent pairs well with the good ol fashioned menthol from the soap making a lovely freezing effect that lasts for a nice amount of time.\n\n​\n\nReally digging this razor, easy to find the angle and very efficient. Have a good weekend everyone!",

For some reason, if a strag (strag: non-hitch hiker) discovers that a hitchhiker has his towel with him, he will automatically assume that he is also in possession of a toothbrush, face flannel, soap, tin of biscuits, flask, compass, map, ball of string, gnat spray, wet weather gear, space suit etc., etc. Furthermore, the strag will then happily lend the hitch hiker any of these or a dozen other items that the hitch hiker might accidentally have \"lost.\" What the strag will think is that any man who can hitch the length and breadth of the galaxy, rough it, slum it, struggle against terrible odds, win through, and still knows where his towel is, is clearly a man to be reckoned with.\n\nHappy Towel Day, you hoopy froods!",

Long have I heard tales about how difficult MWF can be to lather. I dumped a teaspoon and a half of water on top of the puck, put my brush in a teacup of water, and hopped in the shower while they bloomed and soaked.\n\nAfter the shower I loaded my brush a bit heavily (just to be safe) and proceeded to whip up one of the biggest, easiest, fluffiest lathers of my life. What the fuck. It even shaves well! And the scent? Smells exactly like I always imagined shave soap should smell: faintly floral with a light citrus zest. The post-shave feel is a little dry to me, but that's nothing a good balm can't help.\n\nThis blade though.\n\nFrig dudes, this one just doesn't work for me. Endless love letters to Voskhod abound on the shaving forums of the internet, praising its sharpness and smoothness. Not for me. Yes, I got a good BBS shave, but *no, it was not comfortable in the slightest*. Not as a daily shaver at least. Maybe it would work if I was still just shaving 3x a week and giving my face more time to recover between shaves? Oh well! There are loads of other blades out there to choose from.",

It's amazing how much being able to hear feedback from the razor can impact the shave. I was shaving while my wife was still in the shower and the bathroom fan was on, so I couldn't hear much feedback on the cutting. Combine that with a razor I don't use too often and there you have it.\n\nI very much love this scent and wear it on weekends because my wife has it as her favorite... but in scent, longevity, and projection, I prefer Royal Mayfair to Silver Mountain Water.\n\nOut to dinner to celebrate birthdays for my wife, my dad, and myself (all in May).

I'll be honest, I'm not actually tried ViW before so I really have nothing to base it off of but the scent is self is lovely. I actually received this sample when I was looking for something to pair with some Tom Ford Soulie Blanc and while not the same, it feels very complimentary in nature. Bonaire is lime forward with undertones of coconut, bergamot, ginger and hibiscus. It's tropical and lush, and my wife who is particularly a fan of fragrance soaps really enjoys it.\n\nThe scent feels a bit feminine for me, so I paired it with the gnarliest aquatic fragrance I have, Penghalion Blasted Heath. Salt, rock, seaweed and driftwood are bold and present in this fragrences and built upon the soap it feels like a aftermath of a storm blew across an island and stirred up jetsam and flotsam. In other news I'm looking forward to Maggards next week. I'm a bit worried about going over budget with all the great offerings up for sale, but I'll deal with that when the time comes.\n\nHave a great day y'all!\n\nRobot",

You all are in for a treat. Off the puck, I get mostly blood orange, pineapple, and fern. The fern cuts the citrus quite a bit so it's not overly sweet or tart. Once lathered, the fern, and I presume the petitgrain and galbanum started to come out. I didn't get much of the cedar or black amber.\n\nTry This Soap has similar soaps (although all <40% match) as T+S Sicily, BaM Citricuya, Bufflehead Tishomingo, Declaration Puzzle, and Chiseled Face Santa Paula. I definitely get the similarities to Citricuya (hence the AS pairing) and Santa Paula.\n\nThe soap is in the icarus base, which I think most people are familiar with or have read reviews on. It's great and not much else to say that hasn't been said.\n\nI'm really excited for people to get a chance to smell this as I think people will really enjoy it... which is kind of the point!",

WTG, XTG, and ATG clean ups. A mild to mid-aggressive setup. The soap works well but I did not load enough this time. Especially with the boar brush, it ate up lather and did not perform well for second pass and clean ups. Razor + blade combo was amazing. Post shave felt great.\n\n**The Soap** worked well. I did not get enough lather but I still had a good shave with the soap. The scent is intoxicating in a neutral way. It has a dirty \"Night Music\" like scent but it's also floral heavy. I enjoy it but it is not my favorite. The performance was excellent despite the lack of lather. I'll load heavier next time if I'm using a boar brush.\n\n**The Razor and Blade** combination worked well. It the razor the go-to for me and it hasn't disappointed me yet. It shaves well and even ATG feels comfortable. I always have slight irritation during clean ups but I had zero irritation with this one. I might like the Shark SS blade a bit more than I expected.\n\n**The Brush** felt good. Boar brushes feel amazing on the face but sometimes, they are harder to use. They tend to eat up lather more than others and that results in a thinner pass. As you can see during the video, my second pass was sub-optimal. However, due to the slickness of the soap, I was able to shave all the way. This brush also shed couple hairs and I'm a bit worried. It's been almost a year but I realize that I do not use this brush too often. I'm going to keep this in my rotation and hopefully it slows down/stops the shedding soon.\n\n**The aftershave portion** was great. Mild aftershave setup and the hint of menthol felt nice. I thought the cooling balm was a lot lighter but I still felt the chill even through the light menthol. My face was more than ready to head outside after this shave.\n\nOverall, the shave was great. Quality products but poor execution on my part. I need to load heavier with boar brushes and I can't forget that. But I still enjoyed the shave regardless. The Merkur 34C is slowly becoming one of my top razor and same with the Shark SS blade. For the next shave, I'm thinking of using Catie's Bubbles Ocean Grove with the Parker 26C. It's goin to be awesome!",

Trying out the QShave before I send it out on a loan. Haven't used it in so long. And trying Abbate soap for first time. Loved it.\n\n#### ❧ Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(QShave - Adjustable - Futur Clone Setting 3 ::: Gillette - Silver Blue ‹8 uses›)*\n\nGood cut today. A noisy little razor, but very efficient while also being comfortable.\n\nThis is the QShave Adjustable, which is a clone of the Merkur Futur, because their patent ran out.\n\nThe GSB in it, with 7 shaves on, cut so well, that I heard the cutting, but didn't really feel it.\n\n#### ❧ Soap Notes\n*^(Abbate Y La Mantia - Buttero)*\n\nLoved the blend, and the strength on it.\n\nScent: To me, a nice blend of leather and wood, maybe even a sandalwood type.\n\nScent Strength: 6-7/10, very present during shaving.\n\nLather: It wasn't super dense, but it performed really well and felt great on the face. Slickness was outstanding.\n\n1/4+ tsp soap + lightly-wet large-ish badger brush + 5.5 tsp water = 7 passes of lather. Reducing this will make it a pretty economical soap, despite a higher per tub price tag.\n\nBowl - I used the XL version of this bowl:\nhttps://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3392930\n\n#### ❧ Brush Notes\n*^(Stirling - Finest in CravingShaving Blue Slate 26mm‹6 uses›)*\n\nTips are so soft, but the backbone still shoves my face around just a little. But it's young so we'll keep at it. Still going to continue to recommend it ot others because most dont' like the feel as soft as me.\n\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Smooth\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Cut flush to where I just see the tips (above average for me)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm) *and also in the sub's sidebar.*\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

APR base is fantastic, and this scent is a great, bright fougere. Didn't get the matching aftershave thought just due to the price. Cape Verde is one of my favorite fougeres so it was a nice pairing.\n\nThis razor and blade combo continues to impress. Very happy i was able to snag this, and i am also happy with the level 2 OC guard. Very efficient and very smooth.",

Clean, timeless and great smelling while unoffensive and yet still smelling refined. Normally I wouldn't wear this on the weekend, electing for something a bit more adventurous, but I needed to come into the office for a few hours today. Can y'all believe that Maggards is only a few days away? There's a lot I am looking forward to. Someone in the roll call thread asked me if I was planning to take photos. I will have my camera there and I'll be putting together a meetup album for anyone that was not able to attend.\n\n​\n\nIn other news, Oleo is having a 25% off sale on the majority of their soaps and aftershaves and I couldn't resist picking up a few sets that have been on my radar for a while. Something I also appreciate about Oleo is how they make each label unique and different from the next. Don't get me wrong, there's nothing wrong with consistency, and It would keep cost down for label design and reduce illustration time but as someone who enjoys visual art, I can appreciate the one off nature of the labels that Oleo does.\n\n​\n\nIn other news, I sought out some Tom Ford Oud Wood yesterday. Cody at Noble Otter is shipping out his new LE Oudywood Soap that is based on TF Oud Wood and I like to match my soaps to fragrances occasionally. Having not tried Oud Wood, I was really pleased with the scent. Its a very deep, rich wood and feels like stepping into an expensive, wood paneled study. The scent does not smell old or stodgy, just extremely refined and classy. I'm pretty excited and will likely use it in the Lather Games.\n\n​\n\nY'all have a great day!\n\nRobot",

Going to take some time to get my lather where I want it but it seemed a little dry today. I was going back and forth between the 24mm & 26mm but this is plenty big enough. The splay on the brush covers plenty of surface area to distribute lather and the face feel is amazing. Looking forward to using this going forward.\n\nA&E is my top soap base currently and post shave feel remains at the top for me. I picked up some Executive Man balm as I have quite a few Aventus clones, it's not a perfect match for the different takes but I quite enjoy the scent.",

I love Dr. Jon, it's clear I overloaded, I kept adding water and the lather was so slick and creamy, I probably had enough for 5 passes.

I just can't form a flat surface so if I want it clean, I need to touch it up with a DE.\n\nLife is short, shave with good gear.",

It's way more smooth than a lot of grapefruit frags I've tried. Smells like the peel is in there. Scent strength is mid to mild and is quite nice. I prefer a stronger scent though. Performance is good. Didn't really blow me away compared to the other top bases but it's up there for me.\n\nThing I like about this little Omega 22mm Boar is I can just load it until it won't take any more and I'm not stuck battling the lather all morning. After a good break in and about 10 shaves, the thing feels really nice with just the right amount of slight scritch. I'm really enjoying it.\n\nLemon Line is a great citrus and is one of my favorites. Top notes are lemon, orange and lavender; middle notes are white flowers, amber and geranium; base notes are white musk and oak moss.\n\nHope everyone is having a great weekend and my fellow Americans are enjoying the holiday.",

WTG, XTG, and ATG clean ups. I thought I loaded enough but it turns out I didn't. I really need to load heavy from now on. Soap worked well but not the slickest. Great brush and razor + blade. Chilly post shave and we off!\n\n**The Soap** worked well. Again, I loaded for 30 seconds and it was not enough. I also, shook out my brush four times and that resulted in dry brush. Overall, the lather experience was poor today. However, soap was slick and creamy enough to shave with. I didn't get much irritation but only a slight one during ATG. For the scent, I get a floral and laundry scent with hints of the marine notes. Nice and light smell that is not offensive.\n\n**The Razor and Blade** combination worked well. The razor felt very smooth. I enjoy the rounded edges of the razor, even though it's open combed. The shave was smooth but efficient. I felt slight irritation during ATG. I might skip ATG for next couple shaves but it depends if I can get a clean shave without the ATG. I might try two XTG instead. The blade felt good but a little rough towards the end. It might have couple more uses left.\n\n**The Brush** felt nice. The Finest badger feels lovely on the face. It usually holds a lot of lather but I went in a bit dry and resulted in thin lather. Next time, I'll start with a wetter brush and load heavier to get lasting lather throughout the shave. The tips were soft and there was good amount of backbone. It's very close to my ideal brush. It actually might be my ideal brush but I also enjoy the feel of boars so I'm hesitant between the two.\n\n**The aftershave portion** was great. The Alum stung a bit around the mustache/chin/neck area. Not painful but slight stings all around. It tightened the skin very well and I chilled/moisturized it with the Ice cold balm. Lovely feel at the end.\n\nOverall, the shave was great. Poor execution once again. Next shave for sure, I'm going in with a wetter brush and loading until I can see good amount of lather left on the brush. If not, I'll continue loading until I achieve the desired amount. I'm thinking of using Nancy boy cream with a synthetic brush. Perhaps a mild razor as well.",

Funny how I have a complete set of both Burnish and Executive Man, but the system prefers them used separately. I'm fully expecting it to throw the opposite combo on June 2.

No protection, no going over an area twice without re-lathering, but it was serviceable. My eyes are still watering from the menthol of the AS",

Finally got around to trying Admiralty from RPS. And putting another mile on my Feather. And I've just about decided that it's time to raise the knot on the Manchurian to get less backbone.\n\n#### ❧ Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Gillette - Fat Boy Setting 7 ::: Feather ‹34 uses›)*\n\nClose and comfy shave with just a little tugging on pass 1. Normally, setting 7 is a bit too harsh for me, but the smoothed out Feather worked with it well. No irritation.\n\n#### ❧ Soap Notes\n*^(Reef Point Soaps - Admiralty)*\n\nThem: \"The bright, orange citrus scent of Japanese yuzu, together with peppercorn, mellowed over a base of amber, musk and sandalwood. It's smooth, refined, and not your standard citrus scented shaving soap\"\n\nScent: I picked up all the notes except for the Sandalwood. A very inteligent mixture of contrasting scents. The Amber softens the yuzu well. The musk and pepper add dimension. Really well done. I like it a lot.\n\nScent Strength: 4/10, lightly present during shaving.\n\nLather: excellent. Creamy and slick. Too bad the company had to shut down. I know they had lots of competition, but this soap deserves some accolades and a place near the top.\n\n30 sec load on a lightly wet large-ish badger brush + 4 tsp water as I built it up = 4 passes\n\n\n#### ❧ Brush Notes\n*^(Elite Razor - Manchurian Fan CravingShaving Blue/White 26mm‹7 uses›)*\n\nI can see how people like this kind of knot, but the tips just arent soft enough for me, and the backbone just a little too strong, at this kinda standard loft. I'm going to lift it up a little and see what happens.\n\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Just a little tugging\n*Neck*: Just a little tugging\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Cut flush to where I just see the tips (above average for me)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm) *and also in the sub's sidebar.*\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

Well that was not going to happen since I had left my razor at home. Went over to the GF's place where I only have a disposable 3-blade thing sitting around.\n\nStarted off really badly - the blades wouldn't cut at all. Then realized I put the cartridge in upside down. I kinda felt proud about losing the familiarity of using a cartridge but also dumb for screwing a simple tool up. I blame it on the alcohol.\n\nI did not like the cartridge shave. I used to think it wasn't too bad but I miss the feel of my razor and the smoothness of the blades.\n\nAh well - have a good Monday folks!",

Today my son got up with a completely dry diaper and pissed in the potty first thing in the morning. Great success! I celebrated with a leisurely shave using a recently-acquired sample of APR. My first time using this base, which performed very well and particularly shined on the post-shave feel. The scent is hard to characterize, it's sort of a mess of florals, but very well blended to avoid the \"grandma's perfume\" vibe I get from some other floral-forward scents. This is more of a \"walk in a blooming garden on an early spring morning\" vibe. I over-scooped my sample and was left with residual soap in my lather bowl so now my bathroom smells great, and I guess I'll use the rest tomorrow.",

The weather today is looking to be absolutely gorgeous. Happy memorial day to everybody, and thank you to all our veterans that served.\n\nI'm stuck at work today, but that's ok because today is time and a half and I'm off in only a couple hours. So no 15 hour shift for me today. After that, I'm off to the Big Sur for a camping trip!\n\nI take back what I said about the Gillette Tech. With the Nacet blade this razor was very smooth and efficient! Easiest, and quickest shaves I've had so far.\n\nDirty Prose is a great soap, and scent. Has anyone else had their cream turn into a hard soap? Mine did. Not complaining, makes it easier to load in the container, and the performance is still the same!\n\n\nLastly, the SHD knot is breaking in nicely. The tips are starting to hook and gel very nicely. Still a bit of a lather hog though. Does anyone know if the knot gets better at building lathers with use?",

WTG, XTG, and ATG clean up. It's one of the milder setups. The cream was amazing. The razor + blade combo was decent. Nice brush and cold post shave.\n\n**The Soap** worked excellent. Wow, just wow. The cream went from a dissipating cream to a whole lot of lather within couple shaves. I put couple almonds size of cream into the brush and boy, did it lather up quickly. It was slick and creamy. It provided everything that I needed. It could boost a little more in terms of slickness but that is being greedy on my part. Overall, great cream to shave with any time.\n\n**The Razor and Blade** combination worked well. The razor is mild but easy to use. The blade with this razor is okay but I prefer it with the Merkur 34C. I still haven't found a good blade with this razor. Today, the shave felt great until the ATG. ATG was slightly rough but it is very hard to have a smooth ATG. I only had a smooth shave with Merkur 34C and Gillette Old Type. Overall, an efficient and smooth setup but slight roughness during ATG.\n\n**The Brush** felt nice. This was one of the synthetics that I did not enjoy as much. However, the more I use it, the more I enjoy it. This bristle is towards the stiffer side. Even when I paint the brush, it pokes my skin a bit. However, once it splays out, it has a good amount of scrub that I enjoy. Most synthetics just have a soft feel but this gives a good scrub throughout the shave. I was thinking of maybe selling this one but after today, I'm not selling it.\n\n**The aftershave portion** was great. Mild aftershave setup and quick chilling feel. I can never get used to the plethora of menthol. The Ice Cold balm, again, chilled my face to the max and it gives me the drive to head out in the morning. Amazing combination of post shave.\n\nOverall, the shave was great. Finally, I got the lather down and shaved with a creamy and protective lather. The razor + blade was efficient and smooth but still a bit rough during ATG. Brush was amazing; it's got a good scrub for a synthetic. Chilly post shave and I was ready to head out. Tomorrow, I'm thinking of using the same synthetic with the Ocean Grove. I also want to take out a Derby extra and use it with MR1. I already know I don't like Derby's but I have a desire to try one more time. If ATG feels uncomfortable, I'm staying with just XTG passes.",

I love vanilla and ginger and tobacco. Off the puck it smells really promising, with sweet vanilla and hints of the other notes. When it came to lather though, the scent was very light. I slightly over-watered it, but even so.\n\nIt was very pleasant overall, I just didn't have as much scent strength as I was hoping for. Anyway the sweetness and vanilla segued nicely into Unconditional Surrender.\n\nBack to work, booo. Have a good Tuesday all!",

This soap lathered really easily and gave me a thick pillowy lather with very little effort. I found it slightly less thirsty than WK when face lathering, but will push the water further the next time I use it to see how much it can take.\n\nThe scent was strong off the puck and moved to a mid when lathered. My nose picked up a good blend of cedar and fir tree. I found it well blended. I was afraid it would smell like my grandma's cedar chest (a great smell, but not one I want to rub all over my face), but I was happily gifted a smooth outdoorsy cedar instead.\n\nThe Tempest paired well and seemed appropriate since my family was up for a while in the middle of the night last night with tornado warnings (thankfully no touch downs or damage to the area).\n\nNow onto breakfast and LOTS of coffee.\n\nHappy Tuesday!",

Whether it was intentional or not by the opposite party? That's how I feel after the weekend while dog-sitting. Now, I'm not promising our dog isn't a perfect little angel (he likes to sniff out and steal used underwear, among other things), but at least he doesn't put his paws up on the counter, is incontinent, and pretends throwing up in order for us to wake up early.\n\nMy shave was a pleasant disconnect to this awful, pee-smelling reality. First time with this soap, I know others say it smells too astringent, but I think it works. It's odd, but I get a hit of nostalgia with this scent and I've been unable to pinpoint why. Now my bedroom smells like pee but my face is smooth and feels nice.\n\nLife is short, shave with good gear.",

First shave was good. Razor glides very well with this lather. I think I still need to dial in the lather a little bit.\n\nThe soap did not load easily so I keep adding a few drops of water to the soap to load. The brush was damp but not sopping wet.\n\nThe AS splash was good - left the skin feeling good but I missed some menthol effect after. The scent smells amazing to me.\n\nNacet going well except I'm starting to notice that my shave is not as close as it used to be. There's a few patches of hair that remains more than I remember. Blade change may be needed soon for comparison.\n\nHave a good Tuesday all!",

I've been a fan of Feather & Astra blades but might keep Derby in the rotation.\n\nThis is my first time using DG Icarus base and it lived up to the hype. A thirsty soap but it easily produced a thick, slick lather. It may be my technique but the lather wasn't voluminous. We'll see with the next few shaves. Performance was great as both razors just glided right over two days of growth. The post shave feel is where I can really tell a difference. My skin feels soft & smooth, maybe even well hydrated (?).\n\nThe Sellout scent is supposed to be similar to Creed's Aventus. I'd say it's pretty close to the dry down with less of the sweet pineapple on the front. It's a nice scent that is lightly lingering on my skin this morning.\n\nAt any rate, I'm looking forward to shaving with this soap some more. It's only been one shave but it would appear the hype is real.",

I've given him Stirling Barbershop and Barrister and Mann Seville to try (and actually gave him a second Seville tub from a recent Bazaar haul, to keep). Anyway, he lent me Pre de Provence as I've never tried it before.\n\nThe lather started a bit bubbly but really smoothed out with some additional water and agitation through face lathering. I ended up with a nice, slick lather and a great shave. The scent is clean and very muted, so I paired with 88 Chestnut St. for a some citrus flair and made my way off to work.

      "body": "Tuesday 5/28 SOTD\n\n* Razor: Parker Variant adjustable\n* Blade: Polsilver (4)\n* Brush: 26mm Paladin Sumo\n* Soap: B&M Behold the Whatsis Excelsior base\n* Post: Duke Cannon Ice Cold balm\n* Frag: Caron Pour Un Homme EDT\n\nProduct Notes:\n\n* **Razor**: Been trying the Variant on different settings over the last few days to see if I have underappreciated the appeal of adjustables.\n* Seems that I have not. I have found two settings that work well for me, 2.5 and 3 out of 5, and after varying between one and the other during shaves, I feel I could probably go forever on the 2.5 position.\n* I tried mixing up different settings during the shave - \"neck is sensitive, let me use 2\", \"lip and chin are hard to shave, let me use 3.5\" etc and all that felt unnatural and cumbersome. Just setting the razor at one position and doing the regular two pass felt most intuitive and efficient.\n* The Variant shaves well and is nicely made. A rather blatant copy of the Progress, but with an improved turn dial, longer, grippier handle, and slots in the bottom of the baseplate to make rinsing easier. Well balanced and good ergonomics. Ultimately though, if one has no need for the adjustability, the Variant has little to recommend it over comparably priced non-adjustables.",

Wholy Kaw makes a wonderful soap base, however i find its just a touch too easy to overload so i have to be more careful when loading otherwise the lathering process takes too long getting the correct amount of water in there.\n\nThe SynBad from AP Shave Co is definitely not my favorite synthetic on the market, but its not bad. I find it to be kind of scritchy at times. After over a week of shaves on the CG razor, i think it definitely has earned a spot in my rotation.",

I'm picking up some business cards for my photography work and somehow that makes my hobby that I do for Scotch & Shaving money feel more real. I also have a bottle of Guerlain Vevitier arriving in the mail today.\n\nSpeaking of new arrivals, I got a set of Declaration DFS2017 and a set of Unconditional Surrender in the mail on Saturday and today I'm breaking out Unconditional Surrender. For those that aren't aware, /u/hawns built the scent around Ulysses S. Grant's and his ultimatum to Confederates during the Civil War.\n\nThe notes are Amber, Tonka Bean, Amyris, Cedar, Agarwood, Vetiver, Tobacco, Black Tea, Jasmine, Geranium and it uses the bison soap base. The scent to my nose is extremely pleasant, rich and masculine and the amber, tea and tobacco ash are prominent and make for a wonderful combo.\n\nI hope everyone has a good day!\n\nRobot",

I like to alternate my shaves with mild and aggressive days - my skin doesn't seem to like it when I use aggressive razors all the time. My last shave was with the Gillette SA on mild, so I was expecting this to be slightly more on the aggressive side (but not too much since I've been using this Derby blade a few times already), but it ended up being mild without having to worry about slicing myself up, even while using the V3a.\n\nRainy day today, but it's my friend's last day staying in Toronto so we're gonna make the most of it :) Happy Tuesday!",

I did have some strong tingling from the splash though, so I'm nervous it's an irritant for me.\n\nThe scent doesn't last too long. this is my only SBS soap/splash, so I'm not sure if that's how all of their stuff is or just this one. It's not a bad thing with an earthy scent like this that most people probably don't want to smell like all day.\n\nGreat performance from the Karve.

WTG, XTG, and ATG clean ups. Finally got a decent lather going on. The soap was good. Razor + blade combo was okay. I'm liking the brush a lot more. Post shave was mild and light on the menthol.\n\n**The Soap** worked well. It was slick and creamy but still performed as a vegan soap. Nothing wrong with vegan soaps but they just lack a little bit of the fattiness that I enjoy in my soap. Regardless, it gave me a great shave and I enjoyed it. The scent was light and laundry/floral - like. I do get a bit of the salty marine notes as well. A neutral scent that is not offensive.\n\n**The Razor and Blade** combination is a tough one. I usually go through my shave comfortably but Derby Extra just makes it a bit tougher. The razor is mild-mid aggressive but the blade feels dull and rough on the skin. Even from the first pass, I felt the drag and it wasn't comfortable. I felt experimental so I took out the Derby and even on the first use, it didn't feel right. And ATG, as I thought, was tuggy and rough. I got couple of noticeable nicks and I usually don't get any. That said, I do want to give it another try tomorrow.\n\n**The Brush** felt good. This synthetic is becoming one of my favorite... as I say to every brush, haha. It's soft on the tips and stiff on the rest. It feels a bit pokey but once I start lathering, it becomes this resistant synthetic bristles. I like the resistance and it lathers so well. Although the middle of the brush is losing some hair and I can visibly see it. Hopefully it last longer into the years of my wet shaving journey.\n\n**The aftershave portion** was great. Mild aftershave setup and the hint of menthol felt nice. I had this setup couple days ago and I had the same pleasant experience.\n\nOverall, the shave was good. Slick and creamy soap with neutral scent. The razor + blade combo was a bit rough. Definitely no more ATG with Derby Extra even though I got a close to BBS. I'll be using the brush more as I continue. I did not like the synthetic at first but I'm liking it now. Mild post shave that I can use any time. I will be shaving tomorrow if I have time. I have to get up at 3:00 am and go change engine oil later on... working and will be busy. Hopefully I get to test out my [New Brushes!](https://imgur.com/a/19wWFMP)",

The Shark was fairly tuggy and not the most pleasant shave, but the end result is pretty good, relatively smooth with absolutely no irritation. This may be a blade if I was shaving daily, but I shave 3 times a week so I don't want to experience this every shave.\n\nFirst time using the Cheshire soap, I've used the splash before and found it fairly inoffensive to pleasant. The soap has a much stronger tea scent than the splash with the spiciness of the tea and the citrus of the additional Early Grey elements (botanicals?). I've stayed away from tea scents for too long as I imagined getting hit in the face with a Yorkshire tea bag, which I'm not sure how I feel about. The subtleties of this though have convinced me to at least try a few more tea like scents.",

The top cap of the razor is very nicely polished and thin. It looks very good and certainly feels like a premium-level offering. The handle, in my opinion, is not very attractive. The knurling looks nice, but the smooth parts show visible tooling marks. I would be okay with this on a razor that was $150, but for a razor that is $250, I would expect a higher level of finishing. Looks aside, the razor is a nice performer. It's pretty smooth and also efficient. I had a good shave with it this morning and certainly don't have any major complaints about its performance.\n\nMy favorite part about the cream is that it smells really good. It kind of reminds me of the Club Signature, but isn't nearly a sweet and doesn't have the fake caramel smell that that particular soap has to my nose. It smells very classic to me without being stodgy. The performance for me was just okay. Slickness was pretty good, but I felt like the lather was thin. I'll probably give it another try and use a little bit more product next time, but I went out of my way to use a bit more than normal and still had that result. Thanks again for the chance to use these products!",

This is the brush I always use with this soap. It has become a symbiotic relationship much like the old days of my Omega 11047 with Cade Rich. This really is a good performing soap. It has no scent left in it and was very lightly scented when it was new. That doesn't matter to me. What matters is how good it performs on my skin.\n\nSo, it was an adventure getting to work yesterday. Multiple road closures and detours due to large amounts of tornado damage.

I can see why this scent is so popular, and to my nose it's kind of surprising that it only consists of three scent notes as it seems like a more complex scent as I was shaving with it. Either way what a great soap AS combo and being from Florida the citrus and floral aspect play all year round.\n\nIt was my first time using DG's bison tallow base, and after using Icarus jeez is this stuff soft. Far and away the softest soap I have used so far. I feel like I had to be careful loading or I would suck up a big chunk of soap into the brush off the puck. But once on the face with plenty of water added it turned into such a creamy, smooth, and shiny lather. Absolutely love this stuff, maybe a bit less cushiony than Icarus, but it's really immaterial seeing just how much glide this stuff has, as well as just how nice it leaves you face feeling after the shave. Finished it off with the matching AS and my face feels perfect. I just might dry out from how much I will be touching my face today.\n\nHave a great one everybody.",

Trying out Don Luis for first time. And contrasting OC and SB plates for the C.\n\n#### ❧ Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Karve - Christopher Bradley OC C Plate ::: Gillette - Silver Blue ‹10 uses›)*\n\nWow. This shave was so close that I only needed 2 passes... very rare for me. But the comfort was still high. That's the miracle of these OC heads I guess.\n\nNo tugging or irritation.\n\n#### ❧ Soap Notes\n*^(Oleo - Don Luis)*\n\nThem: \"A fresh clean blend of Wood, Sage and Sea Salt Scent Notes: Grapefruit, Sea Salt, Seaweed, Sage, Ambrette, Musk\"\n\nScent: The citrus was easy to pick up, and once I read that it was grapefruit, it was an easy match to appreciate. It's the dominant note, and is tempered by the sage and maybe the musk, and keep it from being too simple and one-dinensional. That's about all I can pick up. Zesty and refreshing scent.\n\nScent Strength: 4-5/10, present during shaving.\n\nLather: Very good, though a little low structure for me. STill, happy with it. Very slick and creamy.\n\n40 second load with lightly-wet scrubby dense boar brush + 2.5 tsp water = 4 passes of lather.\n\nBowl - I used the XL version of this bowl:\nhttps://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3392930\n\n#### ❧ Brush Notes\n*^(Stirling - Boar 24mm Factory Seconds‹15 uses›)*\n\nA young boar, so no surprise it is being stubbornly scrubby and resistant to break-in.

First shave on this blade (Monday, forgot to post it) was one of the best I've ever gotten. Today's was good as well though I could have done better on my chin. Missed a patch on the third pass. Think I still like these better than the feathers but not as well as the Gillette greens. Definitely still a top 2 blade for me.",

Very easy to find the right angle, super comfortable and quite efficient. To be honest i almost gave up on this razor. Literally every other AC Blade was terrible in my opinion. Didn't like any of the feathers, the KAIs were no good, and then i read on another forum about the Schick Pro-Lines. The first shave could be a little rough but every shave after is so smooth and comfortable. I'm so happy i gave these a try.\n\nI didn't think i'd be super fond of the scent on this soap so i didn't buy the aftershave and now i'm kicking myself. I really enjoy this scent. I'm terrible at describing scents but its a floral with a nice spiciness from the hops. Top of the Chain still has it in stock (the soap anyways, aftershave is sold out) and i would definitely give it a try. Only took a week to get to me here in VA from where they are in Canada, which isn't bad at all.",

The Blackbird is the spiritual opposite of the Variant. The Variant is smooth but gimmicky, a sort of cheerful dilettante who gets a bit tiresome. The Blackbird is the Thanos of shaving, grim, efficient, intense. Fortunately, it takes off more than half the stubble from the face (indeed virtually all the stubble) but it does so with tons of blade feel so you feel each hair go as it is sliced. Gets the face nice and smooth with no irritation, but is definitely no fun at parties.\n* **Soap and Post**: One of the nicer B&M scents - moderate in strength and complexity, and the soap and splash work well together for me, as the splash's mild drying effect from the alcohol is offset by the soap's excellent post shave.\n* **Frag**: IMO the most accessible of crossover vetiver scents; if you don't like this one, cease your exploration of vetiver as this is about as civilized a fragrance that can be created using the controversial tropical grass note. Great for all seasons, and a fascinating drydown.",

The fir and lavender make a beautiful combination, and the addition of ylang ylang for that herbal earth tone to mellow out the lavender floral is inspired.\n\nI was absolutely aghast that black ships base scores so low with the Important People who make the reviews around here. The bubbly lather feels great on my skin, the post shave is fantastic, and the whole experience is a lot... Lighter? Than a heavy tallow based soap (I have B&M excelsior and declarations icarus). Maybe that's just the noob in me talking but I always end the shave with a smile and this tub is noticeably emptier than anything else in my den. The aftershave is sharper in lavender and the fir gets lost a little, so I sometimes feel like I might as well be wearing the pure lavender reserve I have from B&M, but after 2 hours it mellows and the full bouquet comes out.\n\nAn exquisite product, would recommend.",

Looks like my skin is still somewhat resilient even though it's been a few months since I've taken blade to face.\n\nMuscle memory is great and I was able to manage a nick free shave. I did spend more time than usual hydrating and dialing in my lather, which should be an indicator of how long I've gone without shaving. After several dips of the brush in water as well as some sprinkling of water, I was able to get a nice marshmallowy lather, albeit a bit drier than I remember.\n\nScent is great and I do believe this pairing with Encre Noir Sport played exceptionally well with The Trail. The frag was able to pull the lavender out of the aftershave and played well with the woodiness of splash. I think this is probably my favorite EdT/AS pairing. I really would like to get my hands on some regular old Encre Noir.",

Intrigued to try the Karve at a similar blade gap to my current favorite razor (GC .84). First impressions: Karve is heavier, slightly smoother (less blade feel) but I would prefer a slightly longer handle. Also a more noticeable metallic scent from the brass, which I found distracting. All that said, I got a great shave, even with a soap I would only describe as adequate. Will give the Karve a more extended turn in the next week or so, paired with some better soaps. Hard to displace the GC in terms of performance and value, IMO....but I'll keep an open mind.",

Because of that and the fact that I just got a bottle of Guerlain Vetiver in the mail yesterday I decided to pair the combo up for a smokey, leathery tobbaco and ash goodness. In all fairness, I don't think this was the best pairing of a fragrance and a soap. The sharp citrus brighness of the bergamot opening from the Guerlain is a bit jarring against the sweet tobbaco and leather of the APR aftershave. In the drydown the two scents compliment each other, but the blast of citrus would have been better served agains some barbershop scents like Seville or Y/R/P.\n\n​\n\nIn other news, I have a set of Noble Otter \"Oudywood\" arriving per my tracking tomorrow. Oud is one of those fragrances that I love when done right and hate when its done poorly. Out of respect for the artistans here, I won't mention the soaps that I have found disagreeable, but between the scent profile of Two Kings and the Tom Ford fragrance of Oud Wood, I am very hopefully that this limited edition will be a homerun.\n\n​\n\nFinally, I am getting ready to pack my bags for the meetup this weekend. It honestly feels a bit surreal to be heading out to Maggards for a weekend trip. For those of you that will be there, please say hello to the guy with the camera. For those that cannot be there, I hope to do a trip report with lots of photos to hopefully inspire others for next year.\n\n​\n\nRobot.",

A bit of irritation, but that's all related to waiting 8 days between shaving. Way too much fur; razor kept getting clogged, but that was kind of expected.\n\nThe scent on Piacenza is interesting. It's sort of like a more citrusy Baker St. Similar to Baker St. I think I like this one a bit more than their standard Babershop offering.",

WTG, XTG, and XTG clean ups. Rough blade resulting in average shave. Razor does not complement the blade well. Soap was amazing. Brush was amazing. Post shave stung but did the job.\n\n**The Soap** worked well. Stirling continues to surprise me with their performance and scent-pleasantness. As I went back to the Sharp Dressed Man, I was amazed. Great clean, cologne, and green scent that I enjoyed throughout the shave. The soap lathered up into a slick and creamy goodness that lasted the entire shave. I could not expect more out of Stirling soaps.\n\n**The Razor and Blade** combination was a bit off. I'm usually okay with his razor but with Derby Extra, it was rough. It dragged on the skin and even without ATG, it did not feel comfortable. If you watch the video, you'll see that I catch myself on the neck with a sting. I usually do not have this experience with any razor, and especially not at second use blade. As a result, I didn't enjoy the shave as much but I still ended with a somewhat clean face. I'm still waiting on a razor that complement Derby Extra blades. Some day... this razor will come.\n\n**The Brush** felt great. I was very curious about the Fan knot and how it felt on the face. After using it, I was in love with it! Fan 2-band badger feels so soft but still gives a good scrub on the face. I could feel every bristle and I did not have any resistance. Unlike bulb where you feel the middle of the brush rotating, the Fan was nicer in a sense where I felt the whole length of the brush. For face latherers, Fan knots are great and I would recommend Yaqi Fan's or Stirling Fan badgers. (I've heard they're the same or similar).\n\n**The aftershave portion** stung. The alum block was painful and I felt the irritation at the end. I learned that Derby Extra and MR1 is no good and I experienced it through the alum block. To combat the dryness of the alum, I used the most moisturizing balm that I have which is Stirling balm. That calmed down the skin while Alum calmed down the irritation and minor nicks.\n\nOverall, the shave was okay. I had a rough session with the razor + blade but the soap + brush combination was out of this world. I loved every second of lathering up but I did not enjoy the shaving part as much. Regardless, my face was mostly clean at the end. The irritation calmed down after the first hour and my face was good to go. For the next shaves, I'm thinking of using the Gillette Slim Twist with Miami Mojito. I have an early morning tomorrow so I'll reserve the new products for another relaxing day.",

South wind 5 to 10 mph. High tide at 9:22 tonight. Up early for work.\n\nSuppose to be a rather chilly and cloudy day so went with richer scent. Excellent performance. While everyone else seems to be jumping on the Icarus wagon Bison is still very much a contender. I am beginning to think that I prefer bison more, just because the process from start to finish is easier for me. I don't have to bloom it. I don't have to leave the tub open for days on end to help get rid of the gamey smell. it builds a slick, cushiony lather in no time with very little effort on my part (not that Icarus doesn't). Bison just seems to \"click\" for me better.\n\nHave a nice Thursday!",

Hoping this scent will brighten things up a bit!\n\nI've been using the Karve plate C almost exclusively for a few weeks, determined to find out if it could beat my top razor if I gave it a good run of regular use. Right around the same time, I picked up the G plate, so that provided a chance to try it with a bit more aggressiveness. Ok a lot more, but to be honest my familiarity with the angle on the Karve by that point meant the shave was nearly identical. The angle of the blade is shaped by the top cap, so changing the position of the safety bar just gives you a little more room.\n\nThat being said, I'm interested in swapping my C plate for a D plate, and my standard handle for a longer one. Lmk if you're interested.\n\nAnyhow, the experiment is over. I went back to the Lvl2 today and it's no question. It's still my top dawg. Intuitive, efficient, and paired with a Wizamet I get great shaves every time. I like the weight of the magnum handle, and hammered is the grippiest handle I own of any razor. The copper is picking up a purplish patina as well. Very cool and useful tool.",

Trying a new soap scent. Didn't really care for it, though the performance was good. But loved the Slim and the PermaSharp in it.\n\n#### ❧ Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Gillette - Slim Adjustable Setting 7 ::: Perma-Sharp Super Stainless ‹4 uses›)*\n\nVery good shave. I don't usually rack it up to a 7, but I did this time at a viewer's request. I'm glad I did. It was a very efficient shave, but also comfortable enough.\n\nNo tugging or irritation.\n\n#### ❧ Soap Notes\n*^(Wild West Shaving - Van Helsing)*\n\nThem: \"Patchouli, Leather, Black Currant, Wood, Smoke.\"\n\nScent: I didn't get much from the scent notes. Maybe Black Currant, because I don't know how that smells. It smelled a bit of just the soap base, though when it got wet into lather form, the scent seemed more like a sweet floral or a floral combined with a fruit. Scent was okay, but not good enough for me to keep around.\n\nScent Strength: 4-5/10, present during shaving.\n\nLather: Performance was good. slick and creamy. A watery slickness, not buttery or fatty. Rinses easily.\n\n1/2 tsp soap + lightly-wet boar brush + 2.5 tsp water = 5 passes of lather.\n\nBowl - I used the XL version of this bowl:\nhttps://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3392930\n\n#### ❧ Brush Notes\n*^(Semogue - 1305 Boar‹15 uses›)*\n\nI like this brush a lot. The 1250 and the 1800 seem to maybe losing a bit too much backbone. But this one is just right. Still very soft, but just the right amount of support.\n\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Cut flush to where I just see the tips (above average for me)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm) *and also in the sub's sidebar.*\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n**Lather Games** Handy Links - [Schedule](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1K_WchM_Uv9lTxltPz5RWm0dYmxgLhHee2-DjQ-Bg8sk/) - [Main Thread](/r/Wetshaving/comments/bipktk/announcing_the_fifth_annual_lather_games/) - [SOTD Formatting](/r/Wetshaving/comments/buj6da/psa_lather_games_sotd_formatting/) - [Trading Thread](/r/Wetshaving/comments/bipkya/lather_games_2019_official_trading_thread)",

I think I went a little overboard tonight with the water in the soap so the lather was a little thinner than usual. I probably shouldn't have had 2 glasses of wine before shaving...\n\nThe 6S and Nacet didn't have any issue gliding against my skin for two days' stubble. This blade is so good and the combo feels very comfortable.\n\nAs usual I diluted the AS a little bit to tone down the scent - Worked out great and my skin feels very smooth. The deltus is great stuff.\n\nHave a great Thursday! Go Toronto Raptors!",

I recently broke out this scent, I've had it forever. To give you some flavor, I'm about to hit 16 years of marriage, and a long ago girlfriend gave me this scent. Now I've replaced it since then, but probably not in the last close to 20 years. I found it, remembered I liked it, and broke it out. Not sure if it's even made any more.",

APR has one of the best bases on the market in my opinion. My only real gripe with them is the jars they come in since the mouth is kind of narrow. Its my understanding that its a supply issue in Australia so i can't fault them for that. This is a great spring time scent in my opinion, a lovely, sharp, floral lavender.\n\nI think i came to terms with the fact the good ol' Plissoft Style synthetic knots are my favorites as far as synthetics go, and i have tried most of the ones on the market. YMMV of course. Wonderful splay and super soft, i put this one into a Wild West Brushworks handle. The Vector still continues to perform effortlessly. Enjoy your Thursday everyone!",

Had to make some last-minute swaps in the schedule due to the early arrival of a new \"most expensive soap\" but things should still work out nicely. Maybe even better than before.\n\nI'm excited, guys. Been doing lots of planning and prep. Still hunting down a few props for photos. I'm a little worried that my new Fatip won't arrive from England on time... it's running pretty late in the mail, but hopefully it'll show up in the next week. Are the rest of y'all ready for this?\n\nEdit: the super duper secret test fragrance from Sephora was Black Opium and it did not meet expectations. Wasn't quite what I was looking for in a sweet coffee scent. Maybe its Nuit Blanche flanker will be more to my liking.",

Yesterday Haze is a sweet-ish creamy fig and wood scent that somehow almost evokes coconut. After shaving with the sunscreen/coconut scent of Sandy Cheeks, this would have been a great choice to continue the scent experience. However, I randomly grabbed Yesterday Haze from my IA sample set to wear today and its wonderful. I just wish it was a little stronger. After wearing O, Unknown yesterday, both of these scents have been pretty weak in the silliage/longevity department. Maybe I don't spray enough? Maybe my nose is broken? I don't know. I'm rather new to the whole fragrance world, but I sense that I've found yet another rabbit hole to dive into. RIP wallet...",

Don't get me wrong, I love YeeHaw, but didn't feel like walking into my office and digging it out of my shaving supplies and instead I elected to use Unconditional Surrender again. Its *rare* that I use the same soap or aftershave twice in a week and I have to really like it. Occasionally I will reach for Fenchurch, Fougere Trois or Pure Lavender back to back because I enjoy them so much, but that's about it. I think Unconditional Surrender might fall in line with those other soaps, its really nice.\n\n​\n\nToday is going to be one of my last shaves with my borrowed Wolfman before I return it to [u/Hyvasuomi79](https://www.reddit.com/user/Hyvasuomi79/) and I am extremely grateful for the opportunity to use it. I have a photo planned for the first day of the Lather Games, since that will be my last shave with the Wolfie and I'll speak more about my thoughts regarding the razor then.\n\n​\n\nBefore I sign off, I wanted to ask y'all a question. Whats your favorite soap? Whats something you keep coming back to shave with despite having lots of different options each day? I'll be at Maggards this Saturday and those are the soaps I would love to check out.\n\n​\n\nRobot.",

A smooth though very efficient shaver, the head apparently had a few QC issues and the brand eventually went to making handles only. The PH is probably the only razor I have that might be called rare, and so that adds to the pleasure of use, but the smooth efficient shave is most of the appeal.\n* Soap: Had the urge to try the 42 scent today, but have not bought it in the recent Excelsior base release. Glissant is still decent, but the appeal of Reserve and Excelsior is clear when using it, especially in terms of post shave feel.\n* Brush: The 28mm \"High Mountain White\" (three band) from Elite is now one of my favorite brushes, feeling like a denser Shavemac D01 with a bit of bloom action. The Manchurian (two band) knot from Elite gets more attention, but the HMW deserves serious consideration especially for those seeking luxury more than firmness.",

I have used it a lot in the past though. Let me reiterate - the difference in ease of lathering between a synthetic and a badger for this soap is night and day. I used an Edwin Jagger synthetic brush (25mm) for the first day - loading was easy, lathering was easy - got a super slick lather (characteristic of reserve base) in relatively low effort. Used my declaration b7 dark ruby the next day - got an (almost) identical lather - but I would say it took at least 3-4x effort. It feels like no matter how much I swirl, I don't pick up anything from the tub. Once I am done lathering, it takes another eternity to build the lather. The increase in effort (especially since I suffer from chronic shoulder pain) kills the added enjoyment I get from natural hair brushes. It absolutely kills it for this base at least. Switched to a synthetic today and man, it is just so so so much easier.\n\nLooking forward to the start of LG.",

Neumann & Co. 1911\n\nThis soap was sent as a surprise return for me sending a sizeable chunk of Boellis Panama 1924. I certainly wasn't expecting this to come! The gifter didn't remember what scent it was, so I have NO idea what it is. It's a masculine, herbaceous scent with a little bit of a medicinal quality way in the back. It's a very nice scent, just wish I knew what it was! Lol!!! I guess I can go through the soaps available in wood bowls and try to match it that way.\n\nThis is my first go with a Penhaligan's soap. Ive used a cream and was NOT impressed, therefor didn't have much hope for this being anything special. I was wrong. This soap is fantastic! It's been sitting in the bowl for months without use, so I was expecting it to be somewhat dried out and difficult to load. Wrong. It loaded with ease, and lathered even easier. It yielded a nice, thick, slick lather with ease. I even brought in the scrubbeast, the Elite. I HATED this knot. It's so scrubby it's uncomfortable for me, and it's set super low in this beast of a handle. I figured the weight of the handle would tame the backbone a bit, and it did. So in preparation, I soaked this bad boy for a long time before the shave. It paid off.\n\nI don't really have any aftershaves that I use regularly that really match this scent. I looked in the drawer and saw an old bottle someone sent me in trade of some samples I sent. Wm. Neumann 1911. Its supposed to have citrus but I never really picked up any of that, more a masculine woody vibe with a little musk. It's a nice scent and it works great...I need to get around to grabbing this and a couple others of theirs. They're nice scents.\n\nThe end result was a DFS with a favorite razor, a hated brush, and a gifted soap and aftershave with scents I don't use too regularly. Couldn't have been better!\n\nHave a great day everyone!!!",

WTG, XTG, and XTG clean ups. Soap had a good performance but it did burn slightly. Razor + blade was wonderful. Brush was okay, still breaking in. Calm and chilling post shave.\n\n**The Soap** worked well. This soap has a great performance and always looks creamy and glistening under the light. However, it does have bentonite clay in the ingredient, which I am allergic to. I used this soap for couple weeks straight and I had no problems. However this time, I let the soap on my skin for too long because of the video. I did get a slight allergic reaction to the soap but it went away after the chilling post shave. The scent is neutral for me now. Great soap but not my favorite.\n\n**The Razor and Blade** combination was amazing. Wow, just wow. I didn't realize that the blade was at its 11th use! It felt like the 2nd or 3rd time using the blade. The razor was smooth and efficient throughout the shave. Blade cut well and tugged slightly but it did not cause any discomfort. Overall, a great combination that I will for sure, return to.\n\n**The Brush** felt okay. With the slight burning from the soap, the short scratchy boar did not help. This brush usually performs well but it does buff my skin. It is not completely broken and due to the nature of the short loft, it gives more scrub than what I like. It still lathered up great so I'll give it that. It's my travel brush but I'm still trying to break it in.\n\n**The aftershave portion** was nice. Despite the allergic reaction from soap and scrub from the brush, the two combo calmed down the skin. Thayer's tones the skin and the Ice Cold Balm chills the skin down. If you haven't tried these two, it's a must for me.\n\nOverall, the shave went well. I had a wonderful shave and I cannot complain about much. I already knew about the nature of the soap and I'm still trying to break in the midget boar. The razor + blade felt so smooth compared to yesterday's painful derby extra shave. For tomorrow's shave, I'll be taking out the all new Yaqi razor. It'll be with the standard head so It should be a medium aggressive shave. I'll pair it with a familiar blade + Lucky Tiger Cream + Fan Badger.",

I'm hoping the Lather Games is the catalyst to turn that around.\n\nSpeaking of the Games, thank you so much to everyone who has put their time and effort into organising them. You've created something amazing. I can't wait to see the awesome [shit]posts, and try out a bunch of new stuff that I would not have otherwise tried.\n\nAnd, as someone who's pretty much as old as it's possible to be and still technically be called a millennial, I'm looking forward to my participation award!\n\nHave a great Friday all!",

I ordered a sample (dunno why, I knew I was gonna buy the whole thing) and liked the smell a lot, but far out, the soap + EdP together are incredible. This stuff lasts ages. I know /u/ntownuser said this is more of a winter time scent, but I could definitely use this year round.

Last one before the Lather Games! Chose a favorite soap and razor. Also was the first time trying out the higher loft setting of this Stirling Finest.\n\n#### ❧ Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Wolfman - WR1 Solid Bar .54 Brushed ::: Kai ‹4 uses›)*\n\nThis was a dream team combo. It cut really closely while staying comfortable and smooth. On most other razors for me, the Kai acts up.\n\nNo tugging or irritation.\n\n#### ❧ Soap Notes\n*^(Cella - Crema Sapone)*\n\nScent: That cherry/almond/marzipan scent that's been on Cella forever.\n\nScent Strength: was great and about 4-5/10 for strength. Nice and present during shave.\n\nLather: creamy and slick! Very very nice.\n\nToday's tub load w large-ish soft badger (and hard water): 40 sec load and 1.75 tsp water gave me 2-3 extra passes.\n\nThis time, I did remember -- thanks to the notes -- that Cella likes to be a little drier than my usual high-elastic standard.\n\nIt treated my skin well, and I didn't feel any need for post shave stuff.\n\n\nBowl - I used the XL version of this bowl:\nhttps://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3392930\n\n#### ❧ Brush Notes\n*^(Stirling - Finest in CravingShaving Blue Slate 26mm‹7 uses›)*\n\nI raised the knot on this one a couple of mm with a plastic washer and I am hoping this knot opens up more. I definitely liked it better, but didn't use enough silicone, so I'll need to re-adhere it before I bring it out again.\n\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Smooth\n*Neck*: Smooth\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Cut flush to where I just see the tips (above average for me)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm) *and also in the sub's sidebar.*\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n**Lather Games** Handy Links - [Schedule](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1K_WchM_Uv9lTxltPz5RWm0dYmxgLhHee2-DjQ-Bg8sk/) - [Main Thread](/r/Wetshaving/comments/bipktk/announcing_the_fifth_annual_lather_games/) - [SOTD Formatting](/r/Wetshaving/comments/buj6da/psa_lather_games_sotd_formatting/) - [Trading Thread](/r/Wetshaving/comments/bipkya/lather_games_2019_official_trading_thread)",

I'm on the plane, awaiting take off to head to Maggards and I could not be more excited. I made it to the gate as the plane was boarding and I'm praying that my checked bag makes it on the flight since my camera and shave kit was checked.\n\nShaved with Oleo Shiloh. Nice and dense lather, good slickness. Picked up this set when they had the 25% off last weekend. Smells great and excellent performance. Ahjoyc2 recommenced using a Vosktok in the Aristocrat and he was right, somehow the shave works better in this head vs an Astra.\n\nY'all have a good day and for the folks going to Maggards, be sure to say hello!\n\nRobot.\n\nPS, thanks for all the good suggestions yesterday. I added them to my list of soaps to check out.",

My obvious fragrance pairing for this is The Cobra and The Canary from Imaginary Authors. This scent is a fresh leather bomb that's sweetened by lemon and softened with iris. I really like it and it's somehow nostalgic to me. I just can't place the memory at the moment. Happy Friday y'all and if your going to Maggard tomorrow, maybe I'll meet you there! Can't wait!",

It would be nice to see a revision, as the protection and post shave is not exactly up to best modern standards. The performance does not souq by any means, but the ol face feels a bit sore at the end of the shave, a feeling which used to be pretty much par the course for me back in 2016-17, but which has gone away in the advent of newer bases like Reserve and WKDM.\n* The scent is lovely, one of the creative and striking scents which MLS does so well. I hope the brand stays the course indefinitely, but I think some new base chemistry would be very welcome.\n* **Brush**: An understated brush, looks very generic thanks to Ye Olde Offe Whyte Rezyn handle but the ergos are fine and the knot is dense and efficient at the same time, and the DO1 three band is an ideal combo of pleasant face feel and useful backbone. The knot has aged quite well with no hair loss or horizontal strays,",

This is the first use since then. Happy Friday shaves, all!",

Really like this one. The vanilla is very forward in this fragrance, and I really enjoy that. The shave was a little rough, though, and I think that was thanks to overhydration due to it being a sample and me not loading enough. Oh well. Overall a good shave.",

Earlier this week I finished off a tub of B&M Fougere Aromatique (which could be considered treason in some parts given how rare of an item it is). I usually need a break after 3017'ing a soap before settling on another target, and Behold the Whatsis was an easy choice.\n\nFirst use of the Whatsis, hadn't used Excelsior before though I know it has quite the reputation, which did not disappoint. The base, aftershave, scent, were all home runs for me.\n\nNot sure how often I'll keep up the posting, and am down to a little over 10 shaves a month this year (how do I kill soaps if I don't shave more often?), but will try to figure out how to respark that.\n\nHow the hell has everyone been?",

I've tried a few of the splashes and found them to be a great value, but put off trying the soap b/c of reviews that it lacked scent strength, etc. Finally got around to trying this tub of Burnish that I acquired via PIF. The scent is indeed mild (but pleasant) however the lather quality is fantastic! It really sticks to your skin and provides a lot of slickness, and the post-shave feel is excellent. I used my most aggressive razor and had zero nicks--even skipped the alum, which I rarely do. And FWIW, the scent strength on the splash is stronger than the soap and definitely in the typical range of longevity (I'm still picking it up 3 hrs later). These sets bundled at $17.50/pop has got to be the best deal in wet-shaving. If anyone has some SB sets they want to trade, PM me. Still working my way through my sample pack of splashes but Burnish is a winner for me.",

Well...it's Aqua di Gio, and that's really about all there is to say. It's not a very good product, at least in my opinion, and the scent is it's only real redeeming quality to me. It's not awful, certainly better than any of the canned goop, but it is the extended spring training to B&M, Declaration, Stirling and other artisans' major leagues. Maybe it would be better with a cartridge razor, but I'm not really all that worried about trying it that way.\n\nThe aftershave is actually quite nice, though. It's a nice thick balm that doesn't take a lot to cover the face and neck, and has the great AdG scent. I would use this on it's own.",

WTG, XTG, and ATG clean ups. Cream performed worse than I thought. Brush was lovely. Razor + blade was above average.\n\n**The Soap** worked okay. I haven't used this cream in a while and I had a good first impression of this. However, I had a different experience today. I did start with a wetter brush and the cream stayed thin and airy. I put more cream in and it began to become thicker. I added a bit more water and it became thin again. This cream tends to take in a little water and if I put too much, it becomes airy. I mostly shave with soaps so creams tend to be more challenging. The scent is nice; orange and citrus scent that leans a bit towards the chemical side. I want to use this again to test out the lather.\n\n**The Brush** felt great. This brush really feels great on the skin and has enough scrub for the feels. It also holds a ton of water so even if I shake it out the usual three times, it retains a lot more. I might have to squeeze out the water with this brush. Also, this brush might eat up creams so I have to test it out more. Boars and badgers tend to eat up the creams so I'll be on the lookout for that.\n\n**The Razor and Blade** combination was good. The razor resembled the Maggard MR1 so it had a decent feel. The fit on the threading was a bit tough as I heard some creaking sounds. There was a slight blade adjustment but nothing crazy. Razor did its job and I liked it. The blade was sharp but not as smooth as I would like it. It's weird how the first pass felt rougher than the other two. Maybe the blade is a bit too sharp for me so the second and third pass dulled it down. Anyways, good combination but I might change the blade out to experiment more with it.\n\n**The aftershave portion** was nice. Lucky Tiger face tonic was wonderful as it calmed down the skin. The moisturizer softened the skin and I was good to head out. All lucky tiger products have this orange/citrus/chemical scent to it. I like the face tonic scent the best\n\nOverall, the shave went well. I had some trouble with the soap but it's still in the experimental stage. The brush was good but again, it had some trouble because of the nature of the cream. Razor + blade was nice but I think there is a better blade for the razor. Nice and calm post shave. I enjoyed the shave but I want to try the shave cream one more time. Maybe in couple days, I'll shave with the Lucky Tiger Shave Cream with the Mellon head + different brush.",
