Brush and Razor not so much since I really only use one of each anyway.\n\nFourth and Pine is one of my favourite scents, I'm making it easier on myself by not trying to smell like a cowboy banana (good band name, \" The Cowboy Bananas\"?) and picking something I'll enjoy.\n\nI definitely need to work on dialing this in, I've been shaving with samples a lot recently so I way overloaded my brush. Need to go a bit easier on the loading next shave.\n\nOverall a great shave, we'll see how I feel about it in 30 days time.",

The first time I bought midnight stag was when it was an imperfect batch so it was like, 7 bucks. I took a whiff and decided it wasn't for me, not at all. I didn't even lather it (probably should have) but sold it for what I bought it for. So here I am, spending double that on a perfect batch, and then quite a bit more to complete the set. It didn't start that way, my original intention was to use up the last of my Stirling Bergamot Lavender, one of my first wetshaving purchases. Something that agrees with me, not this, something that TTS suggests is a 1.53/5. I mean, at least it's more than 1? At least it thinks it is 30% related to Ghost Town Barber, something I'm a big fan of? Well I lather up and I get the leather (no complaints there), the tar, the oil, the bourbon, the musk, and it's not so vile that I thought it once was. I'm not going to profess my love to it, but we'll see if this grows on my kinda like Night Music grows on others. I didn't detect many of the notes it says it has, maybe I will get a whiff of cedar or vanilla or bergamot later this month.\n\nThe shave went well. This blade hasn't seen an Austere August so I'm here to change that. After this month I'll be close to where u/sgrdddy started with his. A different head on my colossus to hopefully help with the blade-feel, otherwise I would've gone with my M1 head. In a shocking twist, I did draw a bit of blood, a first for a blade this dull.\n\nI knew the soap would be easy, what I feared would come next. I opened the splash, threw some on, and got slapped with a strong burst of bourbon, but that only lasted for a second or two. The smokiness and leather came through to stay, along with the motor oil. Then came the [hard part](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/9np9ht/review_chiseled_face_midnight_stag_edp/). I knew this would last so I was hoping to do a half-pump of the spray, but being new, you need to pump it like, 4 or 5 times. It felt like the worlds worst jack-in-the-box. When it came, it came strong and full of vigor. There's no hiding this, I just hope I applied it early enough so that no one at the plant complains. Yes, one of the cleaning ladies had to go home once because someone commented on her perfume, so it's not out of the realm of possibilities.\n\nLife is short, shave with Midnight Stag.",

This soap is not as bad as I expected and better than I remembered. I'm very out of practice with this brush though as I've been primarily using badger brushes for most of the year. I also realize this picture is going to look very similar every day but I'm going to include one anyway\n\nI'm going to relive the early days of wetshaving down to the brush and razor. This was my first step into wetshaving although I was using the bay rum scent instead of lime. This will be a fun trip down memory lane. I do wish the puck was a little wider as this is a little more challenging to load from.\n\nShout out to /u/Fahrenheit915 for running a little side challenge. This will be my set-up and not a single piece will change for 31 days. I'll be happy to provide any proof you need that the blade remains unchanged for the entire period.\n\nHope everyone is going to have as much fun with this as I will.",

I'm in for the u/phteven_j Midnight Stag challenge. Stephen puts so much into this community and puts his time and money into making these games even more exciting. Thank you for that man. You're really an awesome guy. Aside from the Chiseled Face Midnight Stag complete set, I've also tried to challenge myself with my hardware selections.\n\nThe razor I'll be using is the Magic Barber Shavette. It's packaged under a few brand names and can be had for under $2 at Ali Express with free shipping if you don't mind waiting. One Reditor describes it as dragging a tuna can lid across the face. I think it's a great razor and I'm looking forward to improving with it over the month. I'm arming the razor with the Personna Lab Blue. I've never taken one past six shaves so we'll see what happens.\n\nI got a new 24mm boar brush from Stirling to use. I thought it would be fun to see how a boar brush evolves over 31 shaves.\n\n**The Shave** The new boar brush was a bit rough. It was tough to get the lather going and it was scratchy on the face. I eventually got a decent lather and a close shave. This is my first time with Midnight Stag and I actually enjoy the scent. It feels better suited for cooler weather but so far so good. I'm now looking forward to seeing how the EdP progresses. Happy August and all its austerity!",

I'm okay with that. I'm still devoting most of my olfactory energy to studying my fragrance collection (both full bottles and samples) and trying to weed out some of the ho-hum stuff and just focus on the best of the best, and I don't need fancy soaps and aftershaves turning me nose-blind to certain notes in the morning before I ever put a perfume on...\n\nSo today I shaved with unscented soap and aftershave balm and by gum I'm gonna try to accomplish this event in **Ultra Nightmare Mode** even though I've never pushed a blade past 15 shaves before. Worst case scenario? I downgrade to Extreme Mode. Either way I'm aiming to score me some Teacher Soap from /u/rocketk455 because that's what I used to do before I switched careers.\n\nI'm wearing Drakkar Noir today and it's magical. Mmmmmmmmmm. So good. I'll tell y'all about it tomorrow in my ***FOUGERE FUN FINALE.***",

Been a hot minute since I used the goose, it's cheat mode. No nicks or irritation, two passes made for a mild but close enough shave which is just perfect for me. The B2 hasn't been broken out for awhile and I forgot just how soft and pleasant it is. Also forgot just how great Beaudelaire was/is. Last time I used it I recall not loving the soap but only the splash. This time was different, I thought the entire shave was splendid. Finished it off with some Sauvage because from memory it seemed like the spicy notes would line up really well and I didn't have anything else I think would match. Well it's time to pat myself on the back. Sitting here I smell mostly the AS that is on my neck, but I can lift my wrists to my nose to get a peek at what Sauvage is doing. Times like this might lead to me exploring life outside the tighty whitey peehole.\n\nThoughts and prayers to all you AA warriors. I've done it twice and I should have learned my lesson the first time. This year I was never even tempted to sign up for that torture challenge. Good luck to you all, may you avoid the brokenness and existential crises that afflicted me.\n\nPS - I'm posting here too because as of today, I am still in solidarity with your austerity.",

While some of the contests that are happening are tempting I realized I like getting laid too much to smell like leather bananas or greasy new car all month. So I am using the Kraken and will just smell clean. Going to try Ultra nightmare mode because, well why not? Never pushed a blade more than two weeks but here we go. In addition to this I am changing my routine to shave in the mornings. This way I can actually enjoy the smell all day.\n\nToday's shave went well the nacet are always super smooth the first go round. Got a little careless in about me spot on my jaw so I got a weeper but no big deal. The alum took care of it and the balm made everything feel smooth. Over did the balm a little bit and my face is a little greasy. Day 1 down, 30 to go.",

Whatever you wanna call it. The hardest part of this month will be the lack of variety. I unironically enjoy the scent of the Stag and I really don't care if anyone else does. Ok. I take that back. My wife tolerates it, so I'll take it! But yeah, will all my patients for the next month appreciate it as much as I do? I doubt it. But fuck em. I'm gonna be happy as a pig in shit for the next few weeks and they'll all be ok. Happy Austere August everybody!",

Welcome to Austere August!\n\nA few things this morning:\n\n* The date last night was amazing. Definitely the **best** First Date I've ever been on. The weather was perfect, the food was great, the stand-up was hilarious, the venue was interesting....what a great time. Thank you for all the well-wishes. I have even sent this girl SOTD pics and she hasn't run away yet, so I'ma keep rollin' with this.\n\n* This will be my setup (minus the frag, which will change) until the Bandwagon runs out. There is probably **less than a quarter left** in the set, graciously sent to me by /u/stopthehumans. While the software will switch eventually, the hardware will stay the same. I'm liking this brush and I want to get to know it better.\n\n* Quick **frag** note: Still working my way through all the Chatty Lux samples I got awhile ago and I think this one is my favorite so far. I'm normally not a Rose fan but the way the Sandalwood rounds this thing out is just fantastic. I have gotten several compliments on it since I started wearing it.\n\n* **Eminem.** He's one of my favorites ever. If I were stranded on a desert island and I get three artists to have their entire discography, Eminem is one of those. I'm going to link my 31 favorite Eminem songs this month, in no order.\n\n* I was, ahem, *busy* last night and this morning. You can decide what that means but what it means for y'all is that there will be a **PIF** in the AA thread tomorrow. I wanted to do it today but I want to post it as soon as the thread is up so that everyone can see it and enter, if they so choose. So keep a look out. Don't ask me what the PIF is for cuz I ain't even decided yet. But it's been awhile since I've PIF'd and it feels like a good way to kick off AA.\n\n* **Thank you** for all the good vibes lately. I remember that when I first started posting here in Summer 2018, I came to this community for some minor relationship advice. Since then, this subreddit has helped me through several things. Not only that, but I sincerely enjoy sharing the victories with you all. This is a special sub. Thank you. Thank you. And thank you.\n\n* **Quick song note:** I love this one due to the rap at the end. That's sounds ridiculous to say but the first half of the song ain't rap, it's him \"singing.\" Gah, I'm not explaining this very well. Eminem fans, you Stan's, will know what I'm talking about. I'll do better tomorrow, I just threw this whole together before I even had coffee.",

I decided I want to improve my ability to lather tallow soaps. Two kings is just an amazing all around soap and really works for any weather in my opinion. I'm doing the full nightmare mode again this year. I find it to be the most challenge but also provide the most learning opportunity.\n\n\nStarted off with a fantastic shave. It bodes well for this month. I have to travel or about eight or nine days this month so she be interesting having to take my semogue on the road.\n\nEdit: fuck you voice to text and your crappy spelling/translation",

      "body": "And so begins austere august 2019. First time joining in something like this. Since /u/rocketk455 posted a thread on denouncing his dislike of unscented products, I feel that I must defy him. I prefer unscented products. I bought a tub of his V1 unscented shave soap a couple of months ago but had not used it till today.\n\n**soap:** Summer Break Soap Unscented\n\n**razor head:** maggard V3M\n\n**razor handle:** maggard blue version\n\n**blade:** wilkinson sword (4)\n\n**brush:** WCS handle/maggard black knot hybrid\n\n**A/S:** A little unscented witch hazel\n\nI am pretty sure I can maintain using the same shave soap, brush, A/S, razor handle combo. Not so certain about the blade and razor head. I like the V3M head but sometimes gotta change it up. I do prefer the supply SE razor but I am going with DE for this month.\n\nThe shave was rushed today but the soap was really good. Very nice lather. Lately I have been on a kick using a bowl so just scrape the soap, press it in bowl bottom, and dial in the lather. Provided this soap does not irritate my skin after the next couple of days of use, I will use it exclusively. If an unscented base irritates my skin then there is zero chance of me buying a scented version. My skin is pretty finicky so I am careful in what I use. I have thrown out several shave soaps due to them burning while on my skin or causing irritation. Suffice it to say, if my complexion gets bad the product gets thrown out.",

I used the same razor and brush for the entire month, but I didn't post to the official thread. This year, I'm taking it up a notch. I will be participating in u/phteven_j's Southern Witchcrafts side contest (Valley of Ashes soap and splash every day for 31 days) while also attempting MRTNG's Ultra Nightmare Mode (one soap, one razor, one brush, one aftershave, one blade, one month). May the Flying Spaghetti Monster have mercy on my soul.\n\nThe first shave of the month went pretty well. Ashes lathered up nicely. I got a lot of the rubber scent off of the lather today. Two passes with the Wolfie got me to DFS. I could have chased BBS, but that never ends well and I figure it's better to start out the month a little slow. As usual, the Ashes splash (Valley of Splashes?) brought a more robust scent to the party with some of that bitter citrus.\n\nI decided to finish off the morning's shave with [SMN Eva](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Santa-Maria-Novella/Eva-11421.html). If you ever find yourself in Florence, Italy, I highly recommend at least stopping in to gawk at their store. Eva is a nice blend of citrus and spice that (at least so far) pairs well with the bitter citrus notes in Ashes and takes a bit of the industrial edge off. However, I don't think anyone could do a meaningful fragrance review of anything other than Ashes while using Ashes.\n\nIf all goes according to plan, by the end of the month my B8 will be well broken in, I'll be able to use my Wolfie blindfolded, and I'll be an expert at whipping up a perfect lather with SW soaps. Also, I will have hit a new personal record for shaves on a single blade. Good luck to all the Austere August participants!",

It is so strong and so abrasive and I'm totally on the more gourmands! train.\n\nBut! I'm going to power through with you all! I'm a leg shaver and do not typically shave daily, but my friend had the great idea of breaking my legs up into quadrants so that I can participate properly. So I will be doing that + underarms. Today was an underarm day.\n\nDespite my aversion to the smell, the soap lathers really well for me! I think the consistency in usage this month will really help me nail down a good technique.",

I had pre-soaked my puck of Williams because I recall that helping somewhat the last time I decided to engage in this variety of corporal mortification, and loading and face lathering went pretty well, but the lather began to dissipate to a small degree before I finished stropping. Wetting the brush tips and touching the lather up brought it to a usable state, and the shave was decent.\n\nSome notes on the razor and brush: I bought them together from TSS back in April when both were on sale. I had Jarrod finish the razor on a convexed ark, and the edge is pretty keen but extraordinarily mellow, which is why I picked it for a month of daily shaves with lather that's probably going to be mediocre. The worked spine is gorgeous and the yew scales are pretty attractive as well. The downside is that it's carbon steel, so I've got to waste a little time at the beginning and end of each shave cleaning it off and applying oil (I live about a quarter mile from the ocean), steps I don't have to take with my Friodurs. Also, the tang is pretty narrow, though not so much that it's uncomfortable to hold.\n\nThe VP Leonardy brush is great quality badger, but everybody knows what a badger knot with medium backbone and hooked tips feels like so I won't belabor the point.\n\nI got minimal alcohol burn from the aftershave, so I've got that going for me which is nice.\n\nAfter all was said and done, I robbed the lid from a jar of Tabac and used it to cap the (vintage Old Spice) mug that my puck of Williams lives in. I figure that retaining some moisture is better than letting the puck dry out if I want this stuff to be less of a PIA to lather in the morning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHANGAR\n\nFINISHED\n\nKILLS: 0%\n\nITEMS: 100%\n\nSECRET: 0%\n\nTIME: 18:30\n\nPAR: 15:00",

I don't know if it's me or the effect you all are having on me but I am actually enjoying the scent! Totally get the dirty clean feeling that has been described with Midnight Stag. Thanks to u/Phteven_j for opening my world to these new horizons!\n\nThe splash was the real shocker but neither it nor the splash was as over powering as they seemed by first smell in the container. At this point I almost don't know who I am any more.\n\nHappy August my fine people!\n\nPS: I forgot to mention this was my first time using Chiseled Face soap and splash. Had a great 2 pass shave and did not expect to get zero (yes, 0) burn from the splash! Such a wonderful way to start the day. Good luck to all AA shavers and especially the Midnight Stagers and Stagettes (it's a work in progress)!\n\nedit: yeah, I made some updates.",

I'm excited to participate in my first Austere August. I kept a Southern Witchcrafts/ Dogwood theme for the entire month.\n\nEdit: I forgot to mention that I'm doing the Ultra Nightmare Mode.\n\nBrush Notes: The Dogclaration hybrid looks amazing, I can't stop looking at it. Apart from a few test lathers I have only used it once for a face lather and thought AA would be the perfect opportunity to break it in. I had some reservations about using a badger daily, especially one as dense as this, but the consensus seems to be that I will be fine as long as I shake out as much water and give it 24 hours to dry. I rinse my badgers thoroughly to remove any soap, shake out any water and lightly strop them on a towel to remove any remaining water after each shave. I like the variations in the Declaration batches and changing brushes so this will be a test to use the same brush for an entire month.\n\nRazor Notes: It's no secret the Karve CB is my daily driver and the top razor in my den. I like it so much that I have stopped rotating between razors. I briefly thought about using a different razor for AA but decided against it at the last minute. I did not want to change anything that will have me dreading my shaves, especially when I can't change my setup. I also ended up sticking with the B SB plate since it hasn't received as much use lately.\n\nBlade Notes: The longevity of this blade is well documented and I want to see how far I can push this blade. This morning's shave felt extremely smooth and it's off to a very good start.\n\nSoap Notes: Midnight Stag would have kept me in the dog house for a month for sure but Valley of Ashes would not so it was an easy choice. VoA definitely smells like a lighter, more refined version of Midnight Stag to me. It smells sweeter and lighter and is at least tolerated by my wife. We'll see if she feels the same way after a full month of VoA. I also like that it's wearable around the office.\n\nSouthern Witchcrafts is also my favorite vegan based soap. It performs just as great, if not better, than some of the tallow based soaps. The lather is always very slick and protective, has great cushion and post shave feel. I'm looking forward to seeing how much of a dent I can make on this tub.\n\nPost Notes: I'm sticking with the matching VoA aftershave. I used to prefer alcohol based splashes due to my oily skin but I'm quickly being won over by the various non-alcohol options. Southern Witchcrafts has a great aftershave formula and leaves my face feeling great.\n\nFrag Notes: I'm also sticking with the matching frag for the entire month. I was not big on frags in the past but I find myself enjoying complete sets as of late. Even a single spray keeps the scent going and I can continue to enjoy some of these awesome artisan scents.",

Do I really need it? This month is to prove to myself I don't. So let's get into my setup and why...\n\nBlade: Polsilvers are my go to. They also last. I'm trying ultra nightmare mode so this is my best chance with a DE razor.\n\nSoap: I got a couple Palmolive sticks on amazon on a whim like 6-8 months ago and when I used it I was thoroughly impressed by how slick it was. I had always heard good things about them but wrote them off as junk because they're $3. I was definitely wrong. Plenty slick. Lather builds easy and fast. It's not drying either and even then, my post shave routine combats any drying I might have gotten anyway.\n\nRazor: Baili BR131, a $4.50 razor. This is as close as we can get nowadays to Gillette's prices 50 years ago. I also bought this on a whim after reading an article on sharpoligist that this was the razor that inspired the BBS-1. It's essentially a tech clone. Not sure how true that as, but as a Wolfman fan it sold me. Again, I was really impressed with the shave. It's pretty mild, plenty efficient for me for daily shaving, and light enough for my preferences of lightweight razors.\n\nBrush: The SOC badger was a gift from my brother for Christmas a couple years ago. I wanted this because Nick Shaves raved about how great these were and included them on one of his end of year gear lists. I was ecstatic when I got this because it was the first high end piece of gear I'd ever had and I couldn't believe I owned a $50 brush. My brother also commented on how crazy that was but knew I would be excited. Now I own 5 Declaration brushes... This brush is definitely not dense, a little bit scritchy, and splays incredibly easy but is perfectly usable and does everything it's supposed to. Can't really say anything bad about it. It was all I had other than my travel synth that wasn't a dec, I hadn't used this in probably a year and a half so I figured why not.\n\nPost shave: Thayers + Declaration Grooming Liniment. I use Thayers and liniment every single night before bed and I use Liniment after almost every shave. Thayers is great stuff and at $10 for the bottle it's pretty cheap compared to aftershaves. It's no secret I claim liniment as the best post shave product I've ever used and that I hoard all the bottles I can get my hands on. It's the only artisan piece of gear in my AA set up but you can pry my liniments from my cold dead hands. It makes the worst shaves great again. If you're on a budget you can get a great shave with cheap gear but in my opinion don't skimp out on the post shave, at least not with my skin.\n\nFrag: Bandwagon EdP. 'Nuff said. Great all around daily scent that fits any occasion. Got this from an IRC friend and thought my wife wouldn't like it but one day I used it before work and she commented on how good I smelled. That's a huge win in my book.\n\nGood luck to everyone and may all your nightmare shaves be in your favor!",

One of the main reasons I chose this soap specifically is because I really want to learn how to get a crazy good lather with the Excelsior base with my eyes closed. My initial impression of the base was that I didn't like it in comparison to Will's other bases which are so good. I figure there's no way a titan in the wetshaving space like BaM would ever release a substandard soap base so I'm chalking up my bad impression to user error. Lather today was outstanding using the Marco Method^(TM) so I figure I just wasn't drowning this shit enough. I choose this brush because there's no way I'm going a month without using it, lol. The razor, well, that was an easy decision because it's the smoothest operator I've ever shaved with. We'll see if I can stretch this blade to 31 shaves though. Good luck everybody!",

Tried running Cella way dryer than usual, to make sure I wasn't missing anything with all my crazy hydration ideas (I wasn't).\n\nalso, welcome to Austere August. Due to extenuating circumstances, I'm going to have to offset my 31 days of shaving with Stag, because I am stuck at the grandparents with the kids, far from my Stag Stash. I checked and received prior authorization for this deviation, and will be submitting video proof as needed to show my compliance.\n\nSo, in a spirit of camaraderie, I have selected my second longest use blade, a Feather (because my venerable Nacet is at home as well) that is about to have 40 uses on it soon. This is the brush, however, that I'll be using for AA.\n\n#### ❧ Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Karve - Christopher Bradley OC C Plate ::: Feather ‹38 uses›)*\n\nSlight bit of blade feel and rawness that comes from a lather that was too dry. Today was an experiment to confirm how Cella behaves when not hydrated enough. So it's no fault of the soap. For, when I got to the 3rd pass and had it hydrated enough, it was back to the very good slick feel and skin protection that I've come to expect.\n\nRazor and blade continue to be a good combo, despite this shave's conditions.\n\n#### ❧ Soap Notes\n*^(Cella - Crema Sapone)*\n\nScent: That cherry/almond/marzipan scent that's been on Cella forever.\n\nScent Strength: was light and about 4/10 for strength. Lightly present during shave.\n\nLather: Cella likes to be a little drier than my usual high-elastic standard. when hydrated properly to my tastes, it is not a buttery-slick soap like Stirling or Declaration Bison or Barrister and Mann's Glissant. But it still lays down a thin, slick layer of protection on the skin that just works. It's not creamy, but still feels good on the face to me.\n\nWith this shave, I wanted to try and start from the dry end of the spectrum, where the lather was posing nicely for pics and holding its shape easily.\n\nThis looks great, but did not protect my skin as well as it can, and the razor did not have as much glide as usual.\n\nI continued to add water, and by the 3rd pass, I was back to my old viscosity and enjoyed a nicer razor feel and I had my glide back. I tried to feel the lather really well at this point, to be able to return to it more reliably next time.\n\n* Tub-load (soft silvertip badger)\n* 40 sec load with a lightly wet brush\n* 3 tsp water (should add more next time)\n* = 5-6 passes of lather\n\n\nBowl - I used the XL version of this bowl:\nhttps://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3392930\n\n#### ❧ Brush Notes\n*^(Golden Nib - Silvertip Premium 22mm‹29 uses›)*\n\nA very good brush. It helped in letting me know that my lather was too thick by being less smooth as I applied my first pass. As I kept adding water, I was welcomed back to the land of Slickopolis and was rewarded with it's usual luxurious feel.\n\nThis one is not as soft as some that have treated tips, but you would only know that if you did a comparison directly. It's an excellent soft brush for those that like clouds instead of a wall of badger due to a high-density knot.\n\n----\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: A little irritating\n*Neck*: A little irritating\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Few hairs are showing some tip length (with most being cut flush)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm) *and also in the sub's sidebar.*\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

I've been wetshaving about 17 months now and to my mild embarrassment, have accumulated an overflowing drawer of soaps without finishing a single tub. So, my goal for this month is to clear some space and finally finish a tub (or two), starting with the ones that are closest to being done. I also intend to use a single razor (GC .84) which TBH is no hardship at all because I love it and already use it daily. I've never pushed a blade beyond about 2 weeks, but Nacets give me great longevity and if there is a blade that can last me the whole month, I think this is it. I've seen some obscene tallies for Nacets so 31 seems challenging but feasible. Finally, I'm giving myself free reign on brushes (I only own 4 anyway) and splashes (to give me some variety). First up is this jar of shaving cream from Traditional Shaving Co, which is about 25% full by my estimation. I'll use this until it runs out, then switch to my next lowest soap (RR MudderFocker).",

This will be easier than most for me since I only have 1 razor and 1 brush. The unscented aspect appeals to me in a Spartan way, but it turns out I only have the 1 Van der Hagen soap. It's actually not bad. If /u/rocketk455/ can do it, then so can I. I'm also going to try to use the same blade for the whole month (wish me luck)\n\nLove the music idea which is something I used to do when I posted more regularly on this sub. I'm going to go with my favorite band all month with a \"This day in Grateful Dead History\". Today's show is a killer 1973 show with a fucking soaring Eyes. Some consider the period from 1972-1974 to be peak Dead. I love other periods, but I seem to always come back to these 3 years over and over.\n\nGood Luck to all!",

I was psyched up to go with the exact same setup the entire month. I got the GEM as a gift, and first used in back in the Lather Games. I kind of liked it, and figured a month would be a nice chance to get used to it and learn how to use it.\n\nIn addition, I liked the idea of u/rocketk455's unscented challenge. I didn't own any unscented soaps, and figured one might be a nice addition to the den. If I'm ordering soap, might as well support the sponsor, and might as well get aftershave as well. Anyway, I'll be using this stuff for a month, so I'll write more about these later.\n\nSo why am i so pessimistic about my chances of success? Well, between the time I ordered and today, approximately 30% of my body, including parts of my neck, are covered in some plant-based rash (probably either poison ivy or wild parsnip or both). I tried to shave carefully around it all this morning, and still make a mess of things. Given that the meds I'm on don't agree well with open wounds, I've going to need to be more careful than usual with cuts, so there's a really good chance I'm going to skip tomorrow. As much as I love shaving contests and challenges, healing is also important right now.\n\nStill, this is my first year doing this, and I'll stick to this setup if/when I do shave again. Plus, I'll try to be around for moral support. Good luck to all, and leaves of three, let them be.",

I will be keeping everything the same and participating in phtevens Stag challenge.\n\nStarted off with a cold face rinse and cleanse with CeraVe Hydrating Face Wash. Loaded the brush for 20 seconds and began face lathering.\n\nThis soap was super easy to lather with and I think it might be my best lather yet! The smell wasn't actually that disturbing. It does remind me of stepping into a hardware store, but not necessarily a bad thing. Did a 3 pass on the cheeks and 2 pass on the neck. Super happy with the shave.\n\nNow onto the AS and Frag. The AS was tolerable. I got more of a gas/smokey scent from it, but again nothing too horrid. The frag is definitely more boozy and reminds me of the days I used to drink Bulleit. The wife was not pleased with the whole combo. She could smell it as soon as she walked in the room lol\n\nOverall experience with the whole setup was fun and I can see myself sticking with it for a sweet broosh... that's if my wife doesn't kick me out of the house first.\n\nGL to everyone!",

Nothing!\nUsing a mild razor since shaving everyday is pretty rough on the neck meat and will probably only do 1 or 2 easy passes a day.\nThe brush is pretty standard synth but gets the job done well.\nStirling is a solid soap performer, can't complain about it except the fact there are no smellz.\nPersona blue is the go to blade but I've never taken one beyond about 6 uses, hoping for the best on that.\nMy Icy Stare from u/Rocketk455 came today and was excited to use it even with no smellz. Here I am 30 minutes later with a cooling sensation left on my face, is winding down a bit but definitely still present. Very nice products here. Can't wait to take it all the way with my AA buddies!",

I hate it. You all tried to warn me but I didn't listen. I had to do it to see if I could... And because it made my decision about what to use easy since I wanted that Dogwood brush. I'm filled with regret, however, because this scent is super not me (duh, anyone who knows me is saying) and I hate it. I am almost positive it gives me a headache. Had one this morning after I put on the frag and have one now since I've shaved. What joy.\n\nTo add a little extra level of fun for myself, I'm using the same exact blade I have been using since around the middle of Lather Games. However, unlike Lather Games, I'm not splitting my legs up into quadrants and doing the whole things (and underarms) because I want to kill it. Underarms were bad. Legs were bad, too, since I sit to shave and my legs are fairly close to my face. It's just all bad. All of it.\n\nI don't even like this brush. I didn't want to contaminate the ones I like, so I selected this one I was generally PIF'd in a lot when I first started. It's too small for me. Don't like it, either.\n\nAbout the only thing I did like during this shave was that the soap was easy to lather. Otherwise, nope. Gross.",

Although I was shocked at how well this soap performed. I don't recall it being this nice, but I also think I wasn't good at lathering at all, so a year of practice makes a huge difference. Finished off with Thayers, and some CL unconditional Surrender. This scent has quickly become a favorite, and will need to get a full bottle to replace the sample someone gifted me.\n\nGood luck everyone on their 31 days of side challenges, and Austere August madness!",

I totally forgot that I traded for a near full **Bandwagon frag** some time ago. And this works just as well because the other tub I want to kill this month is London Barbershop. So. There's that.\n\n* **Song:** This was one of the first Eminem songs I ever heard. I saw it live during some MTV Award show and it kinda made my jaw drop. I had never heard anything like that before and it launched a fascination for me. Best Part: *\"I must've struck a chord with somebody up in the office\n'Cause Congress keep telling me I ain't causing nothin' but problems\nAnd now they're saying I'm in trouble with the government\nI'm loving it, I shoveled shit all my life, and now I'm dumping it on White America.\"*\n\n* Enough of that though. **WHO WANTS TO DO A PIF!** Yeah, I knew you soap sluts wanted summa that. This PIF is for a very lightly used set of **Murphy and McNeil's Trinity soap/splash.** This is their Aventus dupe. READER BE WARNED: This is the closest thing to a true croap that I've ever used. It's too thick to be a cream but it's extremely soft and difficult to load with a brush. This soap is not for the faint of heart or the weak-willed. Enter at your own risk and don't say I ain't never told you so. CONTEST RULES: None, just pick a number between 1-500. I will draw tomorrow at approximately 0600 hrs MOUNTAIN TIME. I will post pics later, I just woke up. Sue me.\n\n* **BUT WAIT, THERE'S MORE!** The winner will also get exclusive, never before seen access to my entire, not-insignificant den for ~~two~~ THREE standard-sized samples of whatever soap you want, even the unobtanium. Even the shit that I would throw into a bag as I was running out of my burning home.\n\n**EDIT:** I have pics.\n\n* [List of Soaps](https://imgur.com/a/xQvMare) Minus the M & M set and minus another set that is slated to be sold.\n\n* [Den Pic](https://imgur.com/a/IiylYLc) Minus frags.\n\n* [Trinity Pic](https://imgur.com/a/rZ4q9N7)",

This month will be tough, but I could bust it out on the occasional winter day, no problem. My mind has done that thing similar to Leviathan, where it almost smells like meat (not for the better). It's trying, but this stuff doesn't succumb to it like Leviathan. I made a more conscious effort while lathering to detect more notes other than leather and oil, and I did pick up on the cedar. The only part I'm not crazy about is the bourbon shock while reapplying lather. It must be either a combination of a wet face and fresh, prepared lather or the fact you become nose-blind to it during the lathering process so reapplying allows your nose to detect a fresh note of it. It's probably the strongest example of why you should lather your soap before judging its smell. Same as yesterday, that aftershave has a strong bourbon kick in the beginning, which is unfortunate because I really don't like bourbon.\n\nI'm curious what others have to say about the longevity of the aftershave. This stuff sticks around, especially my hands. I'd smell them throughout the day after countless bathroom trips and hand-washes and it was still right there. Not a hint of it, but exactly as I smell it now, less than an hour in. I found it lasted the whole work day, as well as the EDT. I think it wore off after 10 hours or so, I lost count. I'm still not brave enough to do more than one spray of the EDT, which means it's going to be around a while.\n\nLife is short, shave with Stag.",

I've been using big badgers lately and this thing isn't ready for the big leagues yet. Eventually got a good lather and the scent is already growing on me. The splash seemed much sweeter today and I've applied it liberally. My two pumps of EdP were perceptible at midday but not to my liking so I'm going with three pumps today. I'll keep adjusting until I get the right balance of strength and longevity. I usually reapply a fragrance in the afternoon and it can be different than what I wore in the morning. In the name of austerity it's going to be the Stag or it's going to be nothing. Gotta make a travel decant.\n\n\n\nI've made some albums to add photos to track my soap weight, the soap visual and the brush visual. They will be running a day behind since I want to shoot the brush dry.

I'm spending 4 hours in the car with my scentsitive wife on the way to the lake, so no perfume this weekend for her sake. I'll be back home some time Monday and then I'll back-post all my lake shaves. I'll try to remember to take some photos to share with y'all. The Magical Perfumery Tour of olfactory experimentation will resume Tuesday with HORSEFEATHER and should continue at least until the end of August.\n\n(ノ◕ヮ◕)ノ*:・゚✧ ✧゚・: *ヽ(◕ヮ◕ヽ)\n\nIn the mean time...\n\n*****\n\n# Fougère Fun Finale\n\nFougère. Literally, fern. Figuratively, the scent of a mossy herbaceous forest. Built around the \"fern\" accord of sharp / sweet lavender and \"fresh-cut hay\" coumarin, frequently enhanced with other notes to add to the depth of the forest, including: oakmoss, patchouli, cedar, vetiver, sage, or geranium. Not a lot of dudes want to smell like a fresh cut forest, though, so perfumers add more stuff to their fern accord to make it smell more interesting.\n\nUnless I'm mistaken, as soon as you ruin the forest illusion by adding a bunch of extra notes that *don't belong in a forest* you turn that fragrance into an \"Aromatic Fougère\" >!and I don't really feel like arguing about whether or not anything released before 1973 really counts as an aromatic but if you have a clear explanation for why something like Canoe or Brut *wouldn't* be considered aromatic when viewed through a modern lens please let me know!<. A ton of men's fragrances fall under this extremely broad umbrella, which could be sarcastically described as lavender and coumarin with anything you want stacked on top of it. As it happens, I really like these stacks of ferns, fruits, flowers, green aromatics, spices, and/or woods. I like them so much that I have too many of them and started going \"uh oh, have I doubled up on scents?\" (Yes. Yes I did. Sorta.) Hence this final round of tests this month.\n\nAs I worked through this last group of perfumes and reflected on them, I started trying to categorize them into groups or arrange them into a linear spectrum. I did that for the woody and aquatic fragrances earlier in the month but it wasn't working this time. There were too many connections between too many fragrances. Finally I realized that the only way to properly illustrate the connections between them would be to arrange them in a...\n\nRing | Of | Aromatic | Fougères\n:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:\n| **Woody-Fresh:** | **Fresh-Fruity:** |\n| Drakkar Noir | Montblanc Legend |\n**Aromatic-Woody:** ||| **Fruity:**\nAzzaro 2015 ||| Dolce&Gabbana\n|||\n**Aromatic:** ||| **Fruity-Creamy:**\nPaco Rabanne ||| Azzaro L'Eau\n| **Aromatic-Creamy:** | **Creamy-Aromatic:** |\n| Brut | Brut |\n\nOne last word before I get into the descriptions. I've tried to keep things short and sweet because y'all can click on the links if you want to know all of the published scent notes. I'm just going to focus on the things strike me as *characteristic* of each fragrance.\n\nCONTINUED IN COMMENT BELOW (CHARACTER LIMIT EXCEEDED, OOPS)",

In any case, refreshing from the brush after stropping brought the lather back to a usable state and the shave was alright.\n\nTragedy struck at the end of the shave when I put the Tabac jar lid back in the top of the vintage Old Spice mug where the puck of Williams lives. The outside diameter of the part of the lid that goes in the jar is juuuuuuust larger than the inside diameter of the Old Spice mug (which is also tapered rather than cylindrical, so it gets narrower as you go further down), and I must've pushed it in a hair too far, because I now have a ~1.5\" vertical crack in the wall of the jar. When I removed the lid the gap closed up, but I'll have to try to repair it at the end of the month - I don't think CA glue will adhere while the surfaces are all gunked up with soap.\n\nOn a positive note, my wife came in to shower while I was cleaning up and putting my aftershave on, so that was nice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNUCLEAR PLANT\nFINISHED\n\nKILLS: 6% (2/31)\nITEMS: 100% (5/5)\nSECRET: 0% (0/1)\n\nTIME: 18:00\nPAR: 15:00",

Really liking this soap mr summer break dude. Shave is very good, zero complaints. No skin irritation thus far and my skin is not dried out. While I have zero evidence, I am coming to the conclusion that scooping out soap and using a separate container is superior than lathering in the soap container. When lathering in the soap container you are adding water constantly and changing the soap just a wee bit each time. This may just be my OCD kicking in so ignore me.",

Each day after I get home from work I have gotten into the habit of putting away the morning's gear except for the razor and brush. The brush gets set aside to continue to dry and I begin thinking about the next day's setup. Glad I caught myself. I would have eventually remembered and pulled it back out again.\n\nThis morning's shave went much quicker since everything stayed the same and I didn't have to think as much.\n\nTGIF!

I under-loaded the soap a bit and had to squeeze the last suds out of the brush for the second pass on my head. Also, I nicked one of my trouble spots on said second pass. But a quick dab of the styptic pencil cleared things up and my dome is damn near BBS.\n\nMy bottle of Guerlain Vetiver arrived the day before we left on vacation 2 weeks ago and so this is my first time actually spraying it. It does not pair as nicely with Ashes as the Santa Maria Novella did yesterday, but still... wow. This one has immediately jumped up to my favorites list. It's like they took everything I loved about Homme L'eau Boisee and refined it into a more elegant form. I realize it actually ran in the opposite direction since Vetiver was created in 1961 and Homme L'eau Boisee was created in 2012.",

Hitting Cella again, this time with Marco method. A fail, but learned a lot.\n\n#### ❧ Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Karve - Christopher Bradley OC C Plate ::: Feather ‹39 uses›)*\n\nA little scrapey to day. likely due to the excessive soap and brush work.\n\nbut got excellent cut!\n\n#### ❧ Soap Notes\n*^(Cella - Crema Sapone)*\n\nScent: That cherry/almond/marzipan scent that's been on Cella forever.\n\nScent Strength: was light and about 4/10 for strength. Lightly present during shave.\n\nTried the Marco method with Cella today. I opted to watch for the watery slurry to turn opaque and resemble a good lather. Wrong.\n\nProbably used up 6 shaves of lather doing this. Should have stopped at 100-120 stirs as one bit of documentation says. But hey, it was just an attempt. Now I know what not to do.\n\nMaybe there was just too much water in my brush, but Cella just never gave me that early lather concentrate.\n\nSo to fix it, I actually scraped away all the concentrate lather that was on my face as I was trying to add water to thin it down. I did that twice, and still had enough left in my brush to finally put together a good first pass.\n\nFace felt a little raw after, probably because of the over abundance of soap used. and the way more than average amount of brushing to try to work water into it.\n\nso next time, I'll be sure to count swirls and see if that gets me a more reasonable amount of soap.\n\n\nBowl - I used the XL version of this bowl:\nhttps://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3392930\n\n#### ❧ Brush Notes\n*^(Golden Nib - Silvertip Premium 22mm‹30 uses›)*\n\nVery soft and good. Splays super easy. Too easy for some, I'm sure.\n\nNoticed in the center that some hairs looked like they could get tangled. So I made sure to comb it out after the shave.\n\n----\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: A little irritating\n*Neck*: A little irritating\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Cut flush to where I just see the tips (above average for me)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm) *and also in the sub's sidebar.*\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

Raw shea butter is greasy, but damn my face is smooth!\n\nToday's Day in Grateful Dead History is a show I had not listened to before, with the one and only [Pigpen] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_%22Pigpen%22_McKernan). Lovelight is his signature jam and this one is no exception. No one can take you as high as ole Pig when he gets going.

My co-worker actually asked me if I had showered today and that is just a big no thank you from me! I'm not even using the frag, but this is just so strong it absolutely permeates everything it touches and my pants reek of it.\n\nI also decided that I do for sure dislike this brush - it is just too heavy for me and the handle is awkward. I suppose it's a good thing I dislike it since it'll probably smell like an oil can for the rest of its life.\n\nOn a much more positive note! This formula is so good, it lathers so easy and well for me. I'm getting such a nice fluffy cloud that doesn't clog my razor or run off my body. Granted, this is only my second time with it and there's plenty of time for me to F it up, but I'm optimistic.",

This morning I dreaded even more than yesterday putting on the frag. Now that I know what I've gotten myself into, I was so grossed out at the thought, the memory of yesterday's disgust fresh. It's almost like the stag never left me...\n\nAnd yet I was quicker this morning to apply the fragrance. I lingered momentarily before taking off the cap, steeling myself, but once I removed it I was quicker to spray my wrists and get up and moving... As if ending it quickly would have any effect. For those of you who know stag, you know it didn't. It still was so strong and so gross. It pains me.\n\nMy shave was not much better. The thought of being anywhere near stag really weighs on me, so actually having to use it for its intended purpose is a test of my fortitude. It's a struggle and I'm really questioning what's wrong with me. Who am I going to be at the end of this? Will there be any recognizable parts? Will stag have permeated my very soul? Will I become a manly mechanic? When will it start being cute?",

Taking my daughter fishing at dawn, so I only got like 5 hours of sleep. We are meeting up with my dad, my brother, and my nephews for a little family fishing trip.\n\nHad a decent 2 pass shave this morning, so I'd say I am 3 for 3. I am still in a little disbelief that I enjoy the scent of the soap and splash. This may be a new staple in my house!\nHave a great Saturday everyone!\n\nEdit: formatting (sorry on mobile)",

Also I go to newfoundland at the end of August and will probably be taking this same set up with me so it will be doing this until September 9th. I'm probably going to pop a new blade in the razor on the first of the month but still.",

She's a bit suspect because she seems to like everything I force her to smell but this time she offered it up without plying. I had to order more Pipettes so I can make a travel decant of the EdP and reapply in the afternoon. Until then, I'll be using this [larger atomizer](https://i.imgur.com/eX0fCRQ.jpg) to apply and see how the longevity is.\n\n\n\nThe boar brush felt noticeably softer today. I wish it was a little bigger but it makes plenty of lather. I'm dialing back how much soap I scoop and am still grabbing a little too much but the lather is coming up much faster now.\n\n\n\nThe Stag was my TTS SOTD recommendation today so I've checked that box. I'm still loving this fragrance. Enjoy your Saturday, I'll be cutting hair for seven hours.\n\n\n\n\n[Soap Weight Album](https://imgur.com/a/mdeswux)\n\n\n\n\n[Soap Usage Progress Album](https://imgur.com/a/rtrQlKP)\n\n\n\n\n[Brush Break In Progress Album](https://imgur.com/a/fCfOUq2)",

He really gets a kick out of watching me, and likes \"helping\" when he can - eg. by having me brush his arms after I've rinsed my brush at the end of the shave. If he behaves well, he gets two drops of aftershave before I put it away.\n\nThe shave itself went fine. The initial Williams lather did start to dissipate while I was stropping, but I reworked it on my face for a couple of minutes after stropping and it was fine afterwards - kind of thin but slick and it didn't collapse or dry out. For all my complaints about the lather, I'm not nicking myself so far; I'm not sure whether that's because the edge on this razor is a very \"friendly\" Ark edge, or because the lather is better than it looks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOXIN REFINERY\nFINISHED\n\nKILLS: 10% (3/31)\nITEMS: 100% (5/5)\nSECRET: 0% (0/1)\n\nTIME: 19:30\nPAR: 15:00",

This is a wonderful aroma and, since it's Saturday and I'm not leaving the house for a few hours, I get to enjoy the combo for a while longer. When I do leave, it'll be time to get my son's hair cut before school starts back Tuesday (ugh) and then it'll be off to finish school shopping and then to my in-law's for dinner. I may just add an extra spray of the EdP before we head that way to establish a little dominance. Speaking of which, I've been reading that some people are limiting themselves to a spray or two. Should I be doing that? I typically go with 3 or 4. If I can't continuously smell the Stag all day, am I even doing this right? The answer, of course, is no. Super Stag all the way or no way.",

Now, all I get is a nice, smokey and leathery smell, with that bourbon touch between passes. The aftershave still has a strong kick, nothing has changed there, but I actually held my breath for the initial 5 seconds to see if the bourbon smell would dissipate, which it didn't. So that makes me think I go nose-blind to it quickly yet it lingers to anyone catching a fresh whiff of it. I can't get over the appearance of the fragrance. It looks like straight up liquor, but appears like it should flow like a thick syrup. I upped the ante with 2 pumps today, maybe I'll just spray more body parts the longer we go.\n\nLife is short, shave with Stag.",

I've only been shaving every few days this summer, so I imagine I'll probably get 10-12 shaves in for AA. This, I guess, is good a time as any to outline how AA is going to work for me.\n\n1. Sticking with the soap-SMN's generically named Crema da Barba-all month.\n2. Sticking with the razor-Schick HydroMagic-all month.\n3. Going to push the blade until it feels uncomfortable. I'd like to not change the blade all month, but it already has 6 uses on it, and I'm unwilling to punish myself if it starts to suck.\n4. Aftershave will remain a little fluid. I'm thinking of just using my BR Spice until it runs out, and then going through samples until they run out.\n5. Brush will stay the same all month.\n\nSo, that's the deal. I don't think I'll have much trouble sticking to it. Best of luck to all of us.",

Sorry I haven't checked in yet, but between work, kids and a sick wife, I just haven't really had much time to type anything up.\n\nAt any rate, I have shaved every day.\n\nSince last year was all about the luxury stuff, I figured this year I'd actually go somewhat austere (as in not only restricted, but also not luxury stuff) and this is what I came up with:\n\n**Prep:** Just a shower\n**Blade:** Gillette Platinum\n**Razor:** Maggard V3a head on an ATT Atlas handle (I don't have any extra handles, so not exactly budget, but it's less expensive than using my BBS-1 handle)\n**Soap:** Arko stick\n**Brush:** Mühle rose gold synthetic (again, not exactly a budget option, but it's the lowest priced brush I own)\n**Aftershave:** Pinaud Clubman\n**Fragrance:** Davidoff Cool Water\n\nSo for the most part, I'm on a decently low cost setup, barring having to buy new stuff. Having said that, if your technique is up to snuff, you don't need luxury products. I won't say you're not missing out, but I'll definitely say that if you can't afford to spend a bunch on all the fancy stuff you see around, don't kick yourself.\n\nIt's all just incremental increases once you've perfected your technique.",

Woke up early, supposed to be a relaxing day, have a massage scheduled this morning... And I thought it would be a good idea to get this whole Midnight Stag situation over with. Sounds like the perfect time to me.\n\nToday's was a messy shave. Started with too much water so it got the container and my hands messy. Got it in my hair and on my shirt. Don't even really care. While it was a brief annoyance, I've accepted it. This is my life now. I already smell gross from the edp spraying so fucking much, so what's a little more gasoline poured on top? Is it even possible to get any worse? I feel like not. Let's really cover myself in after shave, too, get every piece of shaved skin. Who cares.\n\nI'm contemplating if I am just going to tell my massage person right upfront what the deal is. Hi, sorry we're just meeting each other and you're going to be massaging a gas can, but it's part of my shaving routine for the month... Yeah, no, I don't like the smell, but I'm doing it for ~~a shaving brush~~ a friend. I promise I don't always smell like this. Can we just add in some aromatherapy? Try to pick something that will really play well with the gas station mood I'm going for, I find it the most relaxing.\n\nOr... Maybe I'll just say nothing and let him wonder while he tries not to throw up on me. Depends upon how I feel in the moment.",

Not great, but better than yesterday's Marco attempt. I'm not getting enough soap on the brush.\n\nBUT... should be able to get into the CF Stag situation on next shave!\n\n#### ❧ Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Karve - Christopher Bradley OC C Plate ::: Feather ‹40 uses›)*\n\nShave was harsh on first pass due to thin soap.\n\n#### ❧ Soap Notes\n*^(Cella - Crema Sapone)*\n\nScent: That cherry/almond/marzipan scent that's been on Cella forever.\n\nScent Strength: was light and about 4/10 for strength. Lightly present during shave.\n\nTried the Marco method with Cella again today. I opted for the 120 light swirls to get enough soap on the brush. Well, it didn't work. I didn't get enough soap on my brush for a protective lather. It stayed thin.\n\nI think this badger with its soft tips just holds too much water. and when it does, and I try to load, I just don't get enough soap. So much water came out when I first put the brush to my face that I'm sure I need to do a shake or two to reduce the amount before going to the soap. Then maybe it won't interfere with the loading process.\n\nI would try that next time, but I'm pretty sure next time will be in Stag mode, moving full tilt into Austere August with CF Midnight Stag. I'll resume this little experiment with Cella later. But it has given me two situations that I'll be able to compare with CF's base when I try Marco with it this month.\n\n#### ❧ Brush Notes\n*^(Golden Nib - Silvertip Premium 22mm‹31 uses›)*\n\nFelt fine today.\n\n----\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: A little irritating\n*Neck*: Very irritating\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Few hairs are showing some tip length (with most being cut flush)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm) *and also in the sub's sidebar.*\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n*Edit: removed reference to shave bowl, sinc ethis was a face lather day.*",

Currently, I'm taking a break from the Destiny 2 grind to shower and shave. Conk Lime has provided another smooth shave today and I think if this pattern continues the rest of the month should be smooth sailing.\n\nHonestly, I ought to put all the other supplies away, because it's just Ichabod and I for the whole month.\n\nHope everyone else is enjoying their individual challenges as much as I am, and happy Saturday.",

One could rightly pair this with a citrusy soap that plays off those fleeting top notes, all the way down to something like Reserve Spice for the carnation/tonka bean.

I started to get the almost toothpaste consistency as I loaded until I added more water. Last year I ended up loading with a really wet brush to avoid that, but with a new improved brush the face lathering took no time at all. I'm still going to play around with how wet the brush is because it's still a little dry to start with, otherwise a good shave.\n\nDecided to try a few more summery samples I have as it's a more appropriate time of year. Falling into the sea is a citrusy / tropical / aquatic fragrance. The tropical notes mean it sits on the more feminine side of unisex, with the Lychee and tropical scents dominating the scent. I'll happily finish the sample but I won't be rushing out for a whole bottle, personally I'm not a fan of the tropical notes.",

She asked if it was oud and said it smelled really interesting. Of course I pulled out TTS and showed her the Stag's scent notes. She asked where she could get some for her husband and said she like that it smelled mysterious. I'll make her a 5ml decant as a surprise next week. That was all after a four pump application in the morning. That's exactly the response I want from a fragrance. Not just, \"that smells nice.\" I like it when someone comes in for a second hit and finds the fragrance different and interesting. +1 more for the Stag.\n\nThe Personna blades seem to have a sweet spot at three to five shaves so I'm really in the zone with the Magic Razor right now. I tried the splash on dry skin today and got a nice burn and menthol kick. I'm loving the feeling of the fumes going up my nose and like to hold my hands over my face and take a big hit. My skin is feeling amazing right now and I have no need for any more moisturizer. What a great shave today.\n\n\n\n\n\n[Soap Weight Album](https://imgur.com/a/mdeswux)\n\n\n\n\n[Soap Usage Progress Album](https://imgur.com/a/rtrQlKP)\n\n\n\n\n[Brush Break In Progress Album](https://imgur.com/a/fCfOUq2)",

I'll admit it. I miss the variety already. It's not that I don't love the Stag, but always enjoy the different smells. Thank God I've been on a killing kick so I'm used to the same smell, but I always had that different soap every other day too. Oh well. And I'll admit something else too. Even after my shower at night and the fact that I only use the stag bath soap then, I consistently smell Stag periodically all day and night. This will definitely be an interesting month.",

I'm heading out to Las Vegas for a work trip later today, so I put together a travel size set to use. I'll grab a bowl to lather in once I get to my final destination. I'm checking my bag, so there should be no issue with getting the blade through security.\n\nI hope everyone has a good day and a good shave.",

I gave myself a self-imposed 20 minute time-limit, so that explains the results. If I'm doing 31 of these I've got to keep them fresh.\n\nIt seems like a lot of us Stag-ers are feeling a lot of positive vibes around the scent (eg u/CosmoBarber) , or at least we don't hear about the ones who dislike it yet don't voice their opinion (maybe u/Sleezy-Sleeze). I'm at my folks this weekend and everyone, parents and wife like the scent. I was afraid of stinking up the bathroom and my wife would come to me and relocate me to the guest bathroom so I wouldn't gas her out. However, more than once she said it just smells like you cleaned the bathroom (WTF?! Maybe it's the leather). My Dad likes the EDT, but he agreed that the aftershave looks and smells like bourbon, at least sniffing out of the bottle. My dad doesn't wetshave but I'm considering decanting him some of the EDT for his personal use.\n\nSpeaking of EDT, I hope I made Cosmo and u/Jimstasticness proud, 4 sprays today. Liquid level looks unchanged. Got my nieces baptism today so we'll see if I get unsolicited compliments from the extended family.\n\nLife is short, shave with Stag.",

Last night, I threw it back together. This morning, I jumped right into my head shave not realizing the top cap was still a bit loose. Got one serious nick on the mole over my right ear and a smaller nick on top of my head before I realized something was wrong. Decided I wouldn't be attempting a second pass. Actually... now that I think about it... this probably wasn't my fault. This was probably an attack from u/rmic_ to get me to drop out of the competition. Clever bastard. I'll have to booby trap the house tonight.\n\nCouldn't figure out what frag to pair with Ashes today, so I went alphabetical and reached for Admiral. I think I'm enjoying Admiral more this time than the first time I tried it, when the smoke somewhat overwhelmed my senses. It's a nice pairing with VoA. Almost as if there's a riverfront at the end of the Valley where the coal barges dock and on this particular day there's a fancy riverboat gliding by. Not sure if I'm standing in the VoA watching the riverboat go by or standing on the riverboat staring at the shore.",

Saw Dave Chappelle and Joe Rogan do stand-up last night. They were funny, there was some seriously fun nostalgia feelings watching Dave, but honestly, the \"comedians trying to offensive\" shtick isn't that entertaining for me. Maybe when I was a teenager, but it just feels lazy to me. Like, it's not that you can't make fun of gay people or women or whatever, but shit like \"she should be in the kitchen making a sandwich\" isn't funny. 9 year old boys on Xbox think that's funny. Saying how you don't want to be around gay guys, but you know *lots* of gay guys and support, is stupid and boring.\n\nThanks for coming to my TED talk.",

Usually i only take this blade to 5 shaves, because then it sometimes tugs or i want to try Another blade. Brand hopping is fun.

I really can't fathom how people can get so many shaves out of a single blade. I can't say that I'm loving the boar brush but I've realized that I need to pre-soak the brush prior to shaving to get the best performance out of it. I'm also really liking the ATT razor, it's so much lighter than my Karve daily driver but it still gives me a great shave every time with minimal effort.",

This time with a boar, let's see if it behaves.\n\n#### ❧ Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Timeless - Stainless Steel .68 - Open Comb ::: Gillette - Nacet ‹174 uses›)*\n\nI had almost 2 days of growth, because I was waiting longer than usual, hoping that my Stag splash would make it home. But it's still held hostage across town. Tomorrow, we hope!\n\nI had a comfortable and very excellent shave. The Nacet is back and in it for the long haul.\n\nNo tugging or irritation.\n\n#### ❧ Soap Notes\n*^(Cella - Crema Sapone)*\n\nScent: That cherry/almond/marzipan scent that's been on Cella forever. I so like it.\n\nScent Strength: was light and about 3/10 for strength. Very lightly present during shave.\n\nTried the Marco method with Cella again today. I opted for the 120 light swirls to get enough soap on the brush. BUT this time, it was a boar. I guess the bristle tips were just better at picking up the soap.... but mainly I think this brush just holds less water.\n\nIt worked really well and easily. Boar must just be the ticket. Maybe badger works too if you shake some water out, but the boar gave a good quick lather. Maybe not quite as good (i.e. creamy) as my usual wet method, but very serviceable and quite protective. But the speed is what really surprised me.\n\nAnd I didn't feel it wasted any more soap than my normal wet method. Something that is often an objection, or at least a misconception, with Marco. I'm not saying it's never wasteful. It just wasn't with me this time.\n\n\n\n#### ❧ Brush Notes\n*^(Zenith - B2 Pro Aluminum 26mm‹6 uses›)*\n\nI've pretty much decided on this Zenith for Austere August. I was going for the Golden Nib Silvertip, but I think that one needs to be tweaked a little. It's splay is just a bit too easy. Maybe another o-ring.\n\nBut this boar is medium backbone, maybe a touch less, and the tips have already split (previous owner). It's soft and has a great massage face feel. I think it will be an excellent medium for all kinds of lathering types for AA.\n\n----\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Few hairs are showing some tip length (with most being cut flush)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm) *and also in the sub's sidebar.*\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

It still has a ways to go but it's much more comfortable than just a few days ago. I've still been losing a couple hairs each shave. I wish it was just a tad more dense.\n\n\nMy favorite part of my shave right now is applying the AS splash. I'm getting just a bit of burn and a really nice nose sting as the fumes spread. Then the menthol kicks in.\n\nI'm hoping my pipettes arrive today so I can make a decant for the afternoon. There are 50 18-22 year old girls in my evening class that will certainly be impressed with the Stag. 🤣\n\n[Soap Weight Album](https://imgur.com/a/mdeswux)\n\n[Soap Usage Progress Album](https://imgur.com/a/rtrQlKP)\n\n[Brush Break In Progress Album](https://imgur.com/a/fCfOUq2)",

Now it's getting serious.\n\nMan, I had some wicked dreams last night (tagging u/SoulessSingularity), a nightmare, more or less. In talking with this girl from a high school reunion, it started this sort of challenge I can only describe as something like a Saw movie, except it was a video game. My friends and I had characters we controlled, if something happened to them that didn't kill them, we would feel. That's not all, after each round we were ranked from best to worst, and a marker was placed along the track, more if you did worse, and it went through this branching maze that would determine how much blood was drawn from you. Then we had it resolved, in what I can only describe as a Stewie from Family Guy moment, both in likeness and intelligence, he figured out a way to get beyond the [security measures](https://youtu.be/r9vQOreB2SQ), find where our blood was kept, destroy it before whatever creature that was feasting off of it could drink it, and without it's food source it died. But that's not where the nightmare ends because we got out of it, voluntarily jumped back in and tried to recreate the pattern that \"Stewie\" went through but when we did it ourselves, we must have messed it up because the gate wouldn't open, leaving us cornered. Man, I don't have nightmares often but when I do...\n\nAnyways, the shave went well except I noticed a small post-shave weeper near my mouth, probably an attempt for BBS. Another 4 sprays of EDT, I have the dentist in a half-hour, I figure this is a good test.\n\nLife is short, shave with Stag",

I can feel that my face is getting a little dry from the soap and I didn't work up as much lather on the second pass so there's a small bit of irritation. Nothing that will stop me from continuing this quest tomorrow though.\n\nYesterday was a wonderful day with family. We started with my Grandma's homemade cinnamon rolls then spent the day catching up. We ended with an extended family gathering for homemade ice cream and when I got home I was tired and happy. Now back to the usual work grind.\n\nHope everyone has a wonderful day.",

I had to replace the faucet at my mom's house late last night and fuck me do I hate plumbing. My dad replaced that faucet maybe 7 or 8 years ago and used a cheap shitty Walmart faucet that he proceeded to severely over-tighten underneath. That was kinda his M.O. there. Took me WAAYYY longer than it should and I'm seriously cramped up and sore today. But that Stag made me feel like a new-er-ish man, the more I used it. The EdP was definitely the icing on the cake for me. Thank you Stag, for being there when I needed you.",

Unscented soap continues to impress me. Very happy with the results. I am surprised that the blade has lasted this long given my tough beard. Granted, 8 days is just childs play so reevaulate when I have 15 days of shaves in. I am going to keep going as it is all working well. I do not take anything apart cuz doing this would just cause problems. For the amount of soap that I use here, it will be a long time before I run out. I would be surprised if I am even close to using up 1oz in 31 days. It does not take much to get a lot of good lather. I suspect that mr summer break dude will be getting another order from me for more unscented products as soon as AA is over. Has anybody used summer break aftershaves or body soaps? How do you like it? The thing I worry about with A/S is having a sticky feeling after it has dried. I found this with Stirling but formulations between stirling and SBS are similar'ish. And this V1 of his soap is really good.",

One of those weeds turned out to be stinging nettle (Urtica dioica) and two of my fingertips are still tender and pins-and-needly the next morning. I suspect u/rmic_ planted this in my yard in an attempt to injure my hand so I simply couldn't shave. Well, I did shave this morning and it was great! Two effortless passes riding the cap on the Wolfie and I'm just a half step away from BBS.\n\nToday, I decided to use the matching frag. I'm a huge fan of this one, though I'm not sure it's the best frag for a 90-degree Seattle day. I think it's more of a \"the leaves are turning and if we're lucky it'll hit 70\" kind of scent.\n\nAlso, apparently I broke automod yesterday while trying to revive Theme Thursday. Very sorry, I'll try to get it fixed today.",

Back to work without The Smells.\n\nToday's Day in Grateful Dead History is a great show from 1979. This was a weird year as Jerry had persistent laryngitis which plagued many shows. I tend to skew heavily to Jerry songs, as I suspect many Deadheads do, so I decided to go with one of my fave Bob songs, which I absolutely LOVE, especially paired with St of Circumstance (alas no pairing here)\n\nGood Luck to all and have a great day!",

It reinforced a notion I've had that I get better shaves on > 36 hrs of growth. I had experienced some mild irritation on my neck last week, but taking a day off really helped. I don't mind 24 hrs of stubble but somewhere around 30-36 hrs I'm wanting to shave again, so it's infrequent that I get to a 48+ hrs window between shaves, but perhaps I should do it more often...Fine L'Orange is among my top 2 of the scents I've sampled in that line, right up there w/ Fresh Vetiver. I have no need to acquire more splashes anytime soon but both of those will be on my BST radar when I do.",

Face lathered again with maybe just a smidge more water / less soap than I liked in my brush so it took a little longer to work it down the right consistency but still produced good results in the end. Learned my lesson and kept my touch a lot lighter today and hardly even felt the razor on my face during the shave. Extremely comfortable. Maybe not perfectly BBS smooth everywhere because I still couldn't clearly see what I was doing, but definitely the best of the three lake shaves.\n\nNow that I'm back to civilization I can start wearing my fragrances again, so the Magical Perfumery Tour will be back starting tomorrow. First week might be a little rocky but ehhh that's fine, who cares? It's not like I'm getting paid to do this shit. What does it matter if it gets a little disjointed due to poor planning? Ain't nobody gonna fire me.\n\n/u/rocketk455 here is my back-dated shave as promised!",

Disgusting. I hate it.\n\nEdit: seriously, underarms are so bad. Now that I'm over the initial 'holy shit this is sooooo disgusting' of the first few shaves, it's really sinking in how awful this is specifically. My pits are never, ever going to smell clean again.",

I can now join you other Stag Slags! Extenuating logistical issues have been resolved and the splash has joined up with my waiting soap!\n\nLast year, my AA goals were ...\n\n1. to learn to use Williams, and I did, quite well. I learned how super slick it is (even the modern formula) and then wanted to make sure that folks out there who a) wanted to step back to a long soap heritage and use it every once in a while, or b) wanted to have an enjoyable, slick soap, but needed it to be cheap, knew that Williams can fit the bill.\n2. to try out my Whipped Dog Boar and watch it break in. It did that well, and was a joy to use.\n3. to try out and see if I could get this new Nacet blade to last the whole month. It did (insert understatement emoji here).\n4. to show folks how nice the Blackland Dart was. I learned to use it well, and is a beautiful piece.\n\nAnd this year, we have\n\n1. Gonna keep going with the Nacet and likely will be hitting the 200 mark near the end of August.\n2. Gonna go with another boar, to show folks how awesome Zeniths are (or if it goes south, to learn that too). This looks like a great brush to face or bowl lather with.\n3. Gonna accomplish the Midnight Stag challenge by using the extreme soap and splash for 31 days. Interested to see if I alienate any family members or grow some extra body hair!\n\nThis exception was sought and granted prior to the start of August, and I'll be going into Sept for four days to keep to a consecutive Stag drag of 31 days.\n\n#### ❧ Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Timeless - Stainless Steel .68 - Open Comb ::: Gillette - Nacet ‹175 uses›)*\n\nGreat shave. Not as much taken off via the first pass as when younger, but 3 still take care of it nicely by end of shave. Comfortable and close.\n\nMarching on with the Nacet! Will hit 200 by end of month!\n\n#### ❧ Soap Notes\n*^(Chiseled Face - Midnight Stag)*\n\nA manly scent I enjoy!\n\nScent: The awesome gasoliney leathery woody smokiness\n\nScent Strength: 5/10, nicely present during shaving.\n\nLather: Used my usual wet method to start everything off. This lather, while it does leave a nice thin slick layer, is not going to get really creamy, so I need to run this one dryer than usual.\n\nPerformance was excellent, as was slickness and glide for the razor.\n\nWhat this maker lacks compared to ultra top-tier performance, it gains in scent manliness and character. And that matters so much more to me actually.\n\n* 30 second load with lightly-wet soft boar brush\n* 3.5 tsp water to build the lather\n* = 6 passes of lather.\n\n\nNice, slick feel during rinses.\n\nBowl - I used the XL version of this 3D-printable bowl:\nhttps://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3392930\n\n#### ❧ Brush Notes\n*^(Zenith - B2 Pro Aluminum 26mm‹7 uses›)*\n\nA wonderful medium-backbone (maybe a bit lighter) boar that has split tips from previous owner. Soft yet a real worker. I'm looking forward to using this guy this month in some different lathering techniques.\n\n----\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Few hairs are showing some tip length (with most being cut flush)\n\n----\n\nDogwood Handcrafts' Midnight Stag Side Challenge is sponsored by the awesome dude behind [dogwoodhandcrafts.com](https://dogwoodhandcrafts.com/)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm) *and also in the sub's sidebar.*\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

My wife and I split the time until the alarm went off so we could try and get a few more zzz's.\n\nStill got a decent shave this morning. It's nice not to have to think about which shaving set up to use, but I do miss the variety. Still liking Sweet Lemon, but starting to miss my others scents.\n\nHappy Tuesday!",

Yesterday I didn't say a word about my smell, and neither did the hygienist or dentist (both female) This morning I feel like I blew an opportunity, I should have been like, \"hey, I'm about to make things really uncomfortable, but I'm trying out a new fragrance this month and since you're so close, what do think of it?\" With her being in close proximity to me, I figure she could smell it (4 sprays) and I probably had at least one opportunity to get her opinion on the Stag. It surely wasn't a lack of confidence (because Stag), but maybe it was a tough segue or the fact I couldn't say a word 75% of the time (hand in mouth). She was new and really cute, so my not wanting to be a creep could have been a factor. They tend to keep the same patients and who knows, if I made a bad approach I could have been perma-banned from the office, and I really like the practice in general, cute hygienist notwithstanding.\n\nAnyways, enough about women, this morning was another good shave. Did I mention I tasted the soap the other day? It was between passes and I was trying to figure out where the bourbon splash came from. I thought maybe I ingested some while lathering around the mouth? Well, the answer to that was no, and the taste didn't strike me as bourbon. It also doesn't come through strongly if you don't re-wet the face between passes, so that has to be where that note is coming from.\n\nAnother 4 sprays today. The bubble in the bottle is getting slightly, ever so slightly bigger. Life is short, shave with Stag.",

I'm just convinced that she doesn't understand Stag and that's ok. There's still plenty of time to bring her around.",

      "body": "**2019-08-06 Austere August SOTD / Magical Perfumery Tour: [Horsin' Around](https://i.imgur.com/3FTvd9E.jpg) 1/7**\n\n[**Edit: Weekend SOTD Photo (from the lake)**](https://imgur.com/a/r9Ovlf6)\n\n**Razor:** Fatip Piccolo SE\n\n**Blade:** Gillette Nacet (shave #6)\n\n**Brush:** Yaqi 24mm Moka Express Synthetic\n\n**Lather:** Naked and Smooth by Stirling\n\n**Post:** Unscented Post-Shave Balm by Stirling\n\n**Fragrance:** Horsefeather by /u/hawns\n\n**Thoughts:**\n\nAfter experiencing some face-lathering success at the lake over the weekend, I decided to see how it would go at home. Usually I start the lather in my bowl and then move to my face once it's getting creamy to finish it up, but I'd like to cut back on the amount of post-shave equipment cleanup I need to do and speed up my morning routine. I think I'll make that a secondary goal this month: [git gud](https://i.imgur.com/JuxjmNt.jpg) at face lathering (in addition to playing the unscented shave game on ultra nightmare mode).\n\nI spent a substantial part of my lake vacation reading and thinking about perfume. (I took books and got weird looks from my father-in-law.) I got to fool around with my mother-in-law's massive collection of essential oils. Messed around with them until I had a pretty decent Colonia style citrus / floral / herbal blend and then dumped my formula into my home-brew shave oil to give it a little pizzaz. Can't use it for my shaves this month thanks to [my unholy pact](https://old.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/ciyr6l/austere_august_summer_break_soaps_unscented_stuff/) with /u/rocketk455 so I'll just \"let the scents blend\" for a few weeks and give it a practical test drive when September hits.\n\nToday is my first time wearing the Horsefeather [I won](https://old.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/c9kfyl/2019_feats_of_fragrance_winners/) in the [Feats of Fragrance Contest](https://old.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/bufd9n/2019_feats_of_fragrance_contest/). I only had a vague idea what to expect when I was planning out my fragrances for August and didn't have the bottle in my possession yet. Based on the ingredients of a Horsefeather (ginger beer or ale, bourbon, lemon, and bitters) I took a wild guess at what it might resemble in my collection and blindly picked a few other perfumes to pair with it. Here's where it gets tricky. I don't drink. I don't know what ginger beer is, what bitters are, or what whiskey smells like, much less what *bourbon whiskey* smells like. All I know is it's a high proof liquor aged in charred oak casks.\n\nSo... I guessed wrong when I picked my accompanying fragrances. After trying Horsefeather on a blotter last night I had to completely rewrite my perfume plans for the next week. It's gonna be interesting, folks... none of them smell similar in any way, but they all have certain aspects that I'm reminded of in this Horsefeather. Stay tuned.",

I pulled out most of the stops today, taking the unusual step of blooming the soap while I made breakfast for the family, loaded aggressively, made a very dense proto-lather, added water slowly while face lathering, and appeared to be rewarded with the kind of dense slick lather I'm used to from a decent tallow soap. Alas, this too started to dissipate most of the way through my first pass. I touched things up with the brush before shaving below the Adam's apple because you really don't want to shave that area with a straight without some decent suds. The result of the once-over shave was at least decent, with acceptable closeness and no nicks that I detected, and minimal aftershave burn.\n\nIn other news, I grabbed some Peychaud's bitters and absinthe when I went to pick up wine at the liquor store yesterday as I have a friend visiting this coming weekend and I want to make Sazeracs in addition to our usual Manhattans. Hopefully I don't blow the execution, I've been on a rye kick lately so I've got several of those to experiment with to see what works best in the cocktails.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCENTRAL PROCESSING\nFINISHED\n\nKILLS: 19% (6/31)\nITEMS: 100% (5/5)\nSECRET: 0% (0/1)\n\nTIME: 19:00\nPAR: 15:00",

It's pretty scratchy and doesn't hold lather very well. I used it because I thought the Stag may ruin my good ones but I regret not using a better one. Oh well, I will push through and stay strong (Stag makes you that way)!\n\nOnly did one pass today to give my face a little bit of a break. I must say it feels spectacular! Even though I'm not talking BBS here, my skin feels great, and I especially liked the menthol of the aftershave this morning. Kind of a meh day around here but I am sure it will pick up.\n\nHope everyone has a wonderful Tuesday, you deserve it!\n\nEdit: grammar",

That's the last time I approach unknown garden weeds without gloves on. The bad news is that we've reached the point in my MRTNG's Ultra Nightmare Mode run where things are going to start getting interesting. Today I put the 6th use on my GSB blade. That's generally about as far as I usually take a blade. I've never been the kind of person who pushes things to performance extremes. I don't research strategies for getting maximum mileage out of my electric car. I've never overclocked a CPU. I've never thought about pushing a blade to 100 shaves, or even 10. But now I'm committed to taking this razor blade to 31 shaves.\n\nAfter six shaves in a row, I feel like I'm really getting the hang of the soap and razor... and the brush is breaking in nicely. From here on out, it's going to be a story of me versus the blade.\n\nToday's SOTD pic is either VoA splash or some oily stagnant water I pulled from a roadside puddle in the Valley of Ashes. You be the judge.\n\nFinal parting thought: The Cabin In The Woods is the best horror movie of the 21st century so far.",

I can't really go ATG anymore so I settle for dual XTG. I'm really having no problems keeping with this routine, in fact this month makes you think, why not stick with the same gear a month at a time? I would have no problem with that, especially in this format. I liken it to working out at home versus the gym. At home, you can always talk yourself out of that extra rep, that extra push, or just getting started entirely. Going to a gym with people with the same goals as you helps motivate everyone. I actually like Stag, but the fact that there are some 15 of us together is an incredible motivator. I'll be sad when it's over so I'm enjoying the fact we're only a week in!\n\nLife is short, shave with Lord Stag.",

I'm not doing anything to hurry it along. I really just want to pay attention to what happens through normal usage. It's feeling comfortable and making lather easy enough but it's just not as good as my big badgers. I miss those dense, fluffy bastards.\n\n\n\nOn weekdays, I leave my house before 6 am and get home after 10 pm. I like to reapply my fragrance in the afternoons as I see fit. Sometimes I keep the same, sometimes I switch it up and there're always decants of YRP and Rose Santal in my car. In the name of austerity, I'm sticking with the Stag so I made up a decant for afternoon usage. I don't do anything halfway.\n\n\n\n\nI'd like to say that I'm so proud of Mrs Cosmo. She had her first real American job interview and will be starting at a new salon just down the road from my office. It's challenging for her with English as a second language and still trying to figure out our diverse culture. She's been brave and works through her anxieties and it's all paying off.\n\n\n\n\n\n[Soap Weight Album](https://imgur.com/a/mdeswux)\n\n\n\n\n[Soap Usage Progress Album](https://imgur.com/a/rtrQlKP)\n\n\n\n\n[Brush Break In Progress Album](https://imgur.com/a/fCfOUq2)",

Was pretty good.\n\n#### ❧ Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Timeless - Stainless Steel .68 - Open Comb ::: Gillette - Nacet ‹176 uses›)*\n\nGood shave.\n\n#### ❧ Soap Notes\n*^(Chiseled Face - Midnight Stag)*\n\nScent Strength: 6/10, nicely present during shaving.\nA little stronger today due to more soap being used, I think.\n\nLather: pretty good today. a little dry due to maybe too much soap. But Marco method was easy and worked to give me a pretty good lather. Will try less swirls next time. 120 seemed like it gathered up too much soap. Face felt a little pasty on occasion.\n\nVery nice, slick feel during rinses.\n\nBowl - I used the XL version of this 3D-printable bowl:\nhttps://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3392930\n\n#### ❧ Brush Notes\n*^(Zenith - B2 Pro Aluminum 26mm‹8 uses›)*\n\nYep, this brush will work well with Marco. Seems to hold the right amount of water to make everything work pretty well from beginning.\n\n----\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Few hairs are showing some tip length (with most being cut flush)\n\n----\n\nDogwood Handcrafts' Midnight Stag Side Challenge is sponsored by the awesome dude behind [dogwoodhandcrafts.com](https://dogwoodhandcrafts.com/)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm) *and also in the sub's sidebar.*\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

Did have a slight snafu this mornin in the way of my daughter wetting the bed some time. None of us understand for sure the reasons why she does it sometimes at the age of 9, but we think it's a subconscious nervousness. I dunno. Either way, she's fine after bathing off real quick so I'll call it good. Just trying to maintain that positivity. As for the Stag, it's still kicking along just fine. Still enjoying it immensely. Still spraying ~4 sprays or so each day and getting no negative feedback.",

That's not too special - most decent blades still feel nice to me after a week - but it doesn't seem to be dropping off *at all* yet in efficiency, so maybe I'll actually last all month on it if I'm lucky. Who knows? There's a first time for everything, right?\n\nWanted by Azzaro is, to me, an oddly unfocused fragrance that feels like it can't make up its mind about what it's trying to be. There are bit and bobs of Wanted that I enjoy, but mostly they're passing moments where it reminds me of other fragrances and makes me wish I were wearing them instead. Anyway, I'm wearing it today because it prominently features lemon and ginger (two major players in Horsefeather) and tonka bean (which smells of vanilla and spices, which *may or may not have something to do with bourbon*) and I'm curious to see how the presentation of the lemon and ginger differs from that of Horsefeather.\n\nUnrelated: I rewired all the light switches in my basement to use proper three-way switching yesterday and got them all to work properly on the first try, which is good because I pulled the wires a year ago and had since forgot how everything was routed... had to deduce everything through logic and retrace my steps from a year ago, except the walls are all drywalled and painted now instead of just lumber skeletons so it was a lot harder to figure out what was connected to what. Pretty proud of myself.",

The first pass lather was excellent but due to the brush the 2nd one was very thin. I could have loaded the brush more but with daily shaves, I didn't find it necessary, but I did have a couple of weepers.\n\nI thought I would get tired of the Stag smell pretty quickly but I am still rockin' it and continue to enjoy it. Ask me again on the 31st though!\n\nIt is a great day today so choose to be happy and have a good Wednesday everyone!\n\nPS: I have volleyball tonight and only playing quads (vs 6 people), so I will be sweating a lot and I know the Stag will help me open a can of whoop-ass!",

Was going to go into work late so I could drop the kids off with their mom. Then my wife reminded me I had an interview to hold at 7:30. So I went in, then left and came back.\nShave went well as always. Focusing on the direction of my passes has helped greatly. This may be long longest I have pushed a blade already but everything seems fine, no tugging. Well of to another day. Should have my shipment from Maggards today (helps to live close) and will have a mail call Monday post.",

Yesterday, I woke up early and turned my alarm off so it wouldn't start buzzing while I was mid-shower. This morning, I overslept because my opponent made me forget to turn my alarm back on. As a result of this oversleeping, I only had time for 1 pass. But I will not let these underhanded tactics and vicious attacks prevent me from achieving my goal! Unfortunately, the whole oversleeping thing means I didn't really have time this morning to take pictures of anything, so [here's a thing](https://i.imgur.com/D09MJMK.jpg)",

It's kind of a \"fresh\" smelling fragrance with pepper and violet leaf in the top and heart notes, with a woody dry down. Pretty nice so far.

Barely any tugging and no irritation.\n\n#### ❧ Soap Notes\n*^(Chiseled Face - Midnight Stag)*\n\nA manly scent I enjoy!\n\nScent: The awesome gasoliney leathery woody smokiness\n\nScent Strength: 6/10, nicely present during shaving.\n\nLather: pretty good today. Moved from 120 stirs for a load to 80. A little drier than I might like on the first and second pass, but I had just enough soap for the 3rd and a touch-up. So I don't think I want to reduce the load time any more. But Marco method was easy and worked to give me a pretty good lather. I'll try using the same soap/water mix next time, but in a bowl.\n\n\nNice, slick feel during rinses.\n\nBowl - I used the XL version of this 3D-printable bowl:\nhttps://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3392930\n\n#### ❧ Brush Notes\n*^(Zenith - B2 Pro Aluminum 26mm‹9 uses›)*\n\nStill enjoying the soft face feel and easy massage.\n\n----\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Very Close Shave\n*Neck*: Few hairs are showing some tip length (with most being cut flush)\n\n----\n\nDogwood Handcrafts' Midnight Stag Side Challenge is sponsored by the awesome dude behind [dogwoodhandcrafts.com](https://dogwoodhandcrafts.com/)\n\n[Austere August Intro Thread](/r/Wetshaving/comments/chv8g9/austere_august_2019)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm) *and also in the sub's sidebar.*\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

Is it gasoline with vanilla that is throwing me off? Yesterday was a slow morning at work so I took up the automated email request from CF to review their product. I may have fibbed because I said in one comment that my wife liked it, which I thought was the truth. Well I threw some extra splash on yesterday evening and she made a comment, and when I asked her point blank what her general opinion was, she said \"I said I couldn't smell it in the bathroom, not that I liked it\". So I'll have to downgrade this scent from \"wife-liked\" to \"wife-tolerates\".\n\nLife is short, shave with Stag.",

Its meant to be minty, citrus and a bit boozy, I just get a big hit of sweet sugar which really puts me off. I'm not a fan of sugary sweet scents as they always end up smelling syrupy to me.

Got a much better lather than yesterday. Icarus is an amazing base for sure. Another good shave to start the day.\n\nI am very much enjoying not having to spend brainpower trying to figure out what I am going to shave with. I've spent that extra thinking space on my technique. I've played around with slight changes in the pass directions and angles and found more efficient patterns that make my skin much happier.\n\nHappy Thursday!",

I've just spoiled myself with the fresh blade every week. This'll be fine. The shave itself was ok. Nothing special either way. And, thanks to the wonderful suggestion of u/MadDingersYo, I've decided to gradually increase the amount of sprays of the Stag EdP until someone complains. I'm at 5 sprays today and feel like I'm sitting in a cloud of it, just marinating in motor oil and gasoline. It's pretty great. Now, to expose myself to a shitton of people and see what happens. I'll report back if there's anything noteworthy.",

I think I'll run it as long as I possibly can extending it past the end of August.\n\nI'm going to travel the setup this weekend with a little visit out to my home town to see friends and family so the picture will get a nice change of backdrop.\n\nHope everyone has a wonderful day!",

Not sure what the hell happened there but it was unpleasant, so today I tried to go gentle on my face to let it recover a bit. Settled for DFS instead of BBS (shocking, I know).\n\nI wore Wanted yesterday because I remembered it having a lot of GINGER and Horsefeather has a lot of GINGER and I wanted to see how they compared and then it turned out that I was WRONG and there was pretty much NO GINGER AT ALL in Wanted. Frig... absolute waste of a test day, thanks to poor note-taking the last time I wore the stuff.\n\nAnyway, back to Horsefeather. Broadly speaking, the notes are a splash of lemon, a mug full of fiery ginger beer, and fantasy accords of bourbon and bitters. Sprayed on a blotter I had an easy time picking out the bourbon base but it was harder to separate from the ginger on my skin when I wore it on Tuesday. Let's see how it wears today.",

Such a great way to start the day and it makes me feel so much better. Did the usual 2 pass shave (WTG & XTG) but I am starting to think my razor is more aggressive on one side than the other. Feels like one side almost hardly cuts anything. More testing will determine if I am right or not.\n\nSO the moment you all have been waiting for.......\n\nThe Stag pulled out the win in my sand volleyball game! We lost the first game 24 to 26 but then rallied back and won the next 2 to take the match. I really enjoy playing quads but it does take a lot of energy. Thanks to Stag I smelled manly the whole time!\n\nPlay again tonight as I am subbing for another team, so we will see if the Stag can make it 2 for 2.\n\nHappy Thursday, hope everyone has a good one!\n\nedit: grammar",

Tomorrow is the teenbeast's birthday. Today is the 8th day of Austere August. Luckily (or unfortunately), there doesn't appear to be any major misfortune today which I can blame on u/rmic_. I can only assume that he's either giving up on the competition entirely or marshaling his forces for a major assault in the coming days.\n\nI've been alternating head and face shaves for the last week and today was due to be a head shave day. However, the spot I nicked just above my right ear on a previous shave was a bit unhappy last night, so I opted to do another face shave today instead of the dome. Since I just scraped my face yesterday and my whiskers don't grow super fast, I kept it to a single pass.\n\nFinished up today with Santa Maria Novella's Colonia Russa. This is a really clean, fresh frag and I wish it lasted a little longer. Maybe I need to make like u/CosmoBarber and decant a travel size for myself so I can refresh my stink later in the day. Of course, I really ought to do that for all my favorites and then I could have a little travel-sized stink kit in my work bag. Looks like I can get 25 5ml glass atomizer bottles on Amazon for $11.35... I'll have to think about this...",

Shout out to u/Mantic59 who PIF'ed this UK-made shaving cream to me as part of a sweet grab bag of items I won in a new subscriber drawing from [Sharpologist](https://sharpologist.com/), back when I was first getting into wet shaving. I really enjoyed using it and got a particularly great shave today, thanks to the finish from Easy St. Tomorrow I'll move on to the next soap in my Austere August hit list: RazoRock MudderFocker.",

Was okay, but had to add more water than yesterday. Good news was that lather was better as a result.\n\n#### ❧ Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Timeless - Stainless Steel .68 - Open Comb ::: Gillette - Nacet ‹178 uses›)*\n\nSlick shave today since the lather was a little nicer. Close one, too.\n\nNo tugging or irritation.\n\n#### ❧ Soap Notes\n*^(Chiseled Face - Midnight Stag)*\n\nThis scent does get me a little when I'm eating after shaving. Gasoline-flavored crackers and cheese aren't as good as they seem.\n\nIn general, the scent is heavy, but I'm still liking it.\n\nLather: even better today: slicker, less pasty. 80 stirs on the soap and a brush full of water, just like yesterday. Then to the bowl with it.\n\nSince yesterday's lather on the first two passes was a little too dry and got a little pasty at the end, I expected to have to add even more water than I did yesterday. I did, and it was 1.5 tsp more.\n\nI also expected a wetter lather on the first pass, and a more full, thicker lather on the last pass... due to the bowl helping to level everything out. And that's exactly what I got. Since it was less pasty on the first passes, I had more glide and slickness.\n\nI also discovered that this particular Marco technique uses more soap than a more conventional approach. Yesterday's Marco yeilded maybe 1 pass of lather at the end, while today's had 2-3 passes. So today's was a more efficient use of soap. Soap is cheap, so not a huge deal, but worth mentioning. Also worth saying is that that is for this base and this brush and Marco may not have the same economy with other setups.\n\nBy bringing in the bowl and having to add water, this is starting to resemble a normal wet load, and not Marco, but we're just playing around here for fun, so sue me.\n\n**Soap Weight**: 128g weighed right before today's shave. so I need to discount the first 3 Stag shaves (or just the first 7 days of August) when I do my math for a grams per shave calculation. Weighed after a day of vented storage and without the cap.\n\n\nNice, slick feel during rinses.\n\nBowl - I used the XL version of this 3D-printable bowl:\nhttps://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3392930\n\n#### ❧ Brush Notes\n*^(Zenith - B2 Pro Aluminum 26mm‹10 uses›)*\n\nEnjoyable as usual.\n\n----\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Smooth\n*Neck*: Smooth\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Very Close Shave\n*Neck*: Few hairs are showing some tip length (with most being cut flush)\n\n----\n\nDogwood Handcrafts' Midnight Stag Side Challenge is sponsored by the awesome dude behind [dogwoodhandcrafts.com](https://dogwoodhandcrafts.com/)\n\n[Austere August Intro Thread](/r/Wetshaving/comments/chv8g9/austere_august_2019)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm) *and also in the sub's sidebar.*\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

I have a synthetic omega brush that I keep in my travel bag as well, but with Austere August I was obligated to Stag it up even on vacation. One thing is for sure, soap lathers much differently depending on the hardness of your water (duh). I don't think of my house having hard water but being here on the coast with different water I can really tell how much easier it is to lather my soap and how much \"softer\" the lather feels.",

Decided to just load protolather and whip that up on my face. To a couple of dips into it to get enough, but once it lathered it was slick and fluffy.\n\nI can still smell this set as I shave. I wonder how long it'll go until I can't smell it any more?\n\n3 more shaves until the century club and the blade is still going. I have noticed a slight dullness that has started to develop, but it doesn't effect the quality of the shave I am getting. All I have to do is watch my pressure and angle and let the blade do the work and I am good to go.\n\nHappy Friday!",

Bacon (a Fancy Balinese and the oldest of our cats) and Fish (a total rando from a shelter in Belize and the youngest of our cats) often join me in the bathroom in the morning to ensure I don't drown in the rain closet. Today, and for the rest of Austere August, they will also be on the look out for agents of the enemy. Not that they would do anything if enemy agents were spotted. Bacon is a total scaredy cat and will flee and hide at the first sign of a stranger. Fish, on the other hand, is a complete spaz and may bring the stranger a toy.\n\nWas back to shaving my head this morning and it was easily one of the best shaves I've ever had. I would never have guessed that a blade could run so smoothly on shave number 9. Looking forward to seeing how it does on shave 19 and shave 29. Still enjoying the Valley of Ashes smells and the weather is cooperating by dropping the high temps down into the low 70s.\n\nLater today, after we celebrate the teenbeast's ascension to legal adulthood, I will release the flying monkeys to ensure u/rmic_ has an *interesting* weekend of shaves. All's fair in love and war ...and shaving.",

It is getting less \"chubby\" than when I bought it over a year ago. Wondering if I messed up by cleaning it in a 1:1 water/vinegar solution a few weeks ago? Due to the larger handle (that doesn't fit my stand), this is one that I never hang to dry, but I wouldn't think that would be a big deal. Anyway, moved on to RR MF soap today, which is about 30% full. It's possible this could last me through the rest of the month. We'll see.",

Going back to my wet method of bowl-lathering, but dialing back on the load time.\n\n#### ❧ Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Timeless - Stainless Steel .68 - Open Comb ::: Gillette - Nacet ‹179 uses›)*\n\nClose cut and comfortable. I decided to do an extra pass and less buffing this time, which worked out fine. Sometimes it feels like a faster shave.\n\n#### ❧ Soap Notes\n*^(Chiseled Face - Midnight Stag)*\n\nThis scent does get me a little when I'm eating after shaving. Gasoline-flavored crackers and cheese aren't as good as they seem.\n\nIn general, the scent is heavy, but I'm still liking it.\n\nA manly scent I enjoy!\n\nScent: The awesome gasoliney leathery woody smokiness\n\nScent Strength: 6/10, nicely present during shaving.\n\nLather: Used my usual wet method, reducing the load a bit. This lather, while it does leave a nice thin slick layer, is not going to get really creamy, so I need to run this one dryer than usual.\n\nPerformance was excellent, all the way through the shave, as was slickness and glide for the razor.\n\nGood consistency (wet, but a bit of creamy) here...\n\n* 20 second load with lightly-wet soft boar brush\n* 2.5 tsp water to build the lather\n* = 6 passes of lather.\n\n\nNice, slick feel during rinses.\n\nBowl - I used the XL version of this 3D-printable bowl:\nhttps://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3392930\n\n#### ❧ Brush Notes\n*^(Zenith - B2 Pro Aluminum 26mm‹11 uses›)*\n\nComfy, soft, and massagey as always\n\n----\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Very Close Shave\n*Neck*: Few hairs are showing some tip length (with most being cut flush)\n\n----\n\nDogwood Handcrafts' Midnight Stag Side Challenge is sponsored by the awesome dude behind [dogwoodhandcrafts.com](https://dogwoodhandcrafts.com/)\n\n[Austere August Intro Thread](/r/Wetshaving/comments/chv8g9/austere_august_2019)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm) *and also in the sub's sidebar.*\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

I know for sure one side of my razor is more aggressive than the other. I kind of like it because I can use the less aggressive side on the more sensitive areas. Works pretty well.\n\nAfter using the Stag AS, my collarbone is stronger than ever! Have a wonderful Saturday!!\n\nEdit: format and grammar",

Hopefully nobody else had the idea, I was bored last night. I'm guessing rmic's VOA simply had more soap or the container is heavier than us and our Midnight Stag.\n\nSo I was motivated to work out this morning, so I did it before I showered and shaved. I'll be damned, near 30 minutes into the workout I started getting whiffs of the Stag. I'm happy that it decided to join me, but unfortunately it couldn't muster much in the terms of motivation. Being the first workout I was pretty spent by the last half of the workout. The shave went decently well, one weeper above the lips, again, I'm shocked this ancient blade has the power to cut skin. I gave myself 6 sprays of EDT, to which my wife (who was in the bathroom with me) asked how many more days I have to do this. I don't think the Stag is appealing to her as it does to me.\n\nI've got tickets to the historically-bad Detroit Tiger's game this evening, I plan on doing another drawing by memory. I took some notes of what I can improve this time around, check back tomorrow!\n\nLife is short, shave with good gear.",

Still a good shave with everything all considered. The blade did tug a few times, but I know after last year that I can easily push through this. I went with 6 sprays of the Stag this morning and I think it's ok, although I'm kind of afraid the neighbors can smell it on me. Oh well. I'll see what the wife says later and we'll go from there. I wonder what the magic number of sprays will be considered too much stag.",

My stepbrother brought me some Creed samples from the fancy department stores in Vancouver. I tried out his [Aventus Cologne](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Creed/Aventus-Cologne-51692.html), he tried out my Chatillon Lux Horsefeather, and we used his expert hipster bartending skills to mix Horsefeathers for all the drinkers in the family so I would get a chance to smell it and see what the real thing is like.\n\nI'm not sure I've ever really spent this much time and effort digging into the meat and potatoes of a scent before, dissecting it and approaching it from different angles like this. Well maybe Drakkar Noir, but other than that one, probably not.\n\nToday's fragrance is **The Lacoste Man**. My last wearing wasn't entirely successful but I remember it having a lot of citrus and ginger - like, a Lot of ginger - so it's my last, best hope to find a commercial fragrance that remotely resembles any aspect of Horsefeather. I know it won't actually smell similar, but I still want to smell the difference between *their* ginger and citrus and *Shawn's* ginger and citrus.\n\n**Update:** Okay, there's ginger in here... but it's so different from Horsefeather that it's really not comparable in any way.

Setting this up was kind of tough, because the SMN soap container is the size of a small moon. I couldn't travel with that, so I had to improvise-I have these empty soap stick containers I bought on Amazon, so I scooped a bunch of soap out of there and made a soap stick. This was a bit hard because this really is a soft soap.\n\nAnyway, because it is such a soft soap, it basically fell apart when I smeared it on my face. So I ended up basically having to dab it on. Nice thing is this left a lot of soap for my brush to work with, and I got a great lather.\n\nThe shave was rather good, I even was able to use the buffing technique at the end on my 4th pass to get a rather close shave.",

Per the suggestions of the voices in my head, I did palm strop it before this morning's festivities. Absolutely wonderful shave. I did two passes (WTG, XTG) riding the top cap and I am damn near BBS. By the end of the month, this Wolfie may have ruined me for other razors.\n\nAlso, no obvious signs of outside interference today. All of my gear was exactly where I left it and how I left it. Nobody seems to have spiked my Ashes splash with foreign substances. This obviously means that u/rmic_ is going to have an extra nasty surprise for me tomorrow.\n\nFinal observation, YRP is not a quiet scent. The initial blast of citrus went very well with the Ashes but rather than fading into the background and mingling with the other smell, YRP has stepped forward and declared that it will be the only thing I can smell. I didn't realize this frag could be such a beast.",

If I'm not comfortable shaving, I'll have to stop AA, and give my face a break. Let us hope that's not the case.",

Maybe I'll do that for a bit but then there's stuff that needs doing.\n\n\n\n\nToday I took the least amount of soap I've probably ever used and had more lather than ever. It was flying everywhere. My skin was still a little dry but not as much as previous days. After the splash, it feels great. There's minimal tightness and it's very very smooth. The boar brush felt really comfortable today. I enjoyed it a lot. It was just the right scritchy.\n\n\n\nI don't think there's any difference between 2 and 10 pumps on the EdP. It seems to dry down to the same level regardless. I did 9 yesterday and I'll do 10 today but I'll wait until I'm going outside so it fresh. I'll see if I can impress the hell out of some coed at the laundromat.\n\n\n\n\nHope everyone can enjoy a nice Sunday.\n\n\n\n\n\n[Soap Weight Album](https://imgur.com/a/mdeswux)\n\n\n\n\n[Soap Usage Progress Album](https://imgur.com/a/rtrQlKP)\n\n\n\n\n[Brush Break In Progress Album](https://imgur.com/a/fCfOUq2)",

Definite improvement, but not quite enough to bump the scoreboard below. There are people out there who describe the lather they get from this stuff as similar to artisan soaps or the best soaps from normal soapmakers, and this isn't B&M or Tabac. I'll have to beg /u/Old_Hiker for tips, because I feel like I've pulled out all the stops and the lather remains merely OK.\n\nIn other news, the fishing trip went well yesterday morning. My oldest son (5) and my middle son (3) both caught their first fish! They were just little sunnies, nothing big enough to keep, but it was great for them to feel the excitement of reeling one in, and to feel a fish's scales once I got the hook out. The water by us was pretty clear, so you could see the little guys swim away for a ways after throwing them back in the water. In the afternoon, we went swimming in the sound near low tide and played around on a sandbar the was about two feet deep about 300 yards from shore. A good day.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nREFINERY\nFINISHED\n\nKILLS: 35% (11/31)\nITEMS: 100% (5/5)\nSECRET: 0% (0/1)\n\nTIME: 18:30\nPAR: 15:00",

The donkey milk formula is excellent, and I'm getting great lathers using the Marco Method. I haven't noticed any major blade performance issues after 11 shaves, which is farther than I have ever taken a blade. The blade does have a fair bit of tea staining, but that's probably from me not drying the blade off completely. I hope is hangs on for the rest of the month. The toner is leaving my face and neck feeling nice and refreshed after each shave, I just wish that the scent would last a little longer.\n\nHave a great day everyone.",

I was unable to find anything that even remotely resembled Horsefeather. How can I describe it without giving away too much? Picture a really strong, spicy ginger ale or ginger beer. Maybe add a fresh slice of ginger right to the drink. Hold the glass below your nose, inhaling deeply and getting the popping carbonated bubbles right up in there. Take a swig. Swish it around in your mouth. Feel the burn. Swallow. Exhale. Feel the heat on your breath.\n\nThat's the starting point of Horsefeather.\n\nThen add a nice short-lived sweet lemon squeeze fresh out of the sprayer; some alluring aromatic sharp-herbal bitters that blend in with the ginger; and some creamy-woody-vanilla undertones that purr along in stark contrast below the raging ginger above.\n\nThat's as best as I can describe the stuff right now. I don't want to go into any more prosaic rambling about the perfume as I'm saving that for the next issue of a certain e-zine.",

Here's the [soap weight progress graph](https://imgur.com/a/O8iXN3F) for those who are weighing their soaps. I've projected the trendline to show where we should land at the end of the month (except u/sgrdddy, can't make a trendline with only 1 data point). The math estimates our end-of-month weights at:\n\n|u/rmic: 98.1g|\n|:-|\n|u/CosmoBarber: 85.8g|\n|Me: 78.1g|\n|u/Ythin: 63.4g|\n\nWe'll see if these hold true. Life is short, shave with Stag.",

I suspect u/rmic_ may be poisoning me. Which, I suppose, is a fair response to my biological warfare attacks. As we near the halfway point of this month-long competition for a brush neither of us really needs, I can honestly say that I admire my opponent's competitive spirit and I hope he fails miserably.\n\nAnother great lather with the SW soap today, though I'm beginning to wonder if Chattahoochee river water isn't a primary ingredient of the splash, lending it its distinctive color.\n\nTried my first spray of Weinstrasse this morning. My initial impression is a very powdery, refined fougere. I'm really enjoying it so far and may need to obtain a full set when it drops next month.",

Thirty sprays of Stag on each wrist. I had braced myself to it to be absolutely terrible... Was thinking happy thoughts, a puppy playing fetch, rainbows after a spring shower, a big pile of smores... And I don't think I needed it. Sure, half of each arm is covered in Stag and it started dripping down my hand but it didn't smell that bad. I think I'm just used to it at this point? I don't want to know.\n\n/u/CosmoBarber I now agree that there maybe isn't a difference between spray amount. More sprays is more coverage (unless you're very very accurate with your spray, I guess) but it doesn't smell exceptionally worse.\n\nWhy has my life become this.",

I can't compete with 60 sprays, especially on a work day, so I did 10 now, and will probably spray myself another 10 times midway through the day, and repeat the next two days. I will say, adoreyou has certainly earned her brush, maybe more. Maybe u/chiseledface should gift her a new bottle of EDT for being so enthusiastic about his product? Certainly what she did last night made a considerable dent in her bottle. Or maybe he should make bath bombs with the scent? I'm sure that ought to be a hit with the ladies!\n\nLife is short, shave with Stag",

Blade felt a bit tuggy in spots but I soldiered through it. Might palm strop the blade tomorrow if I remember to see if that'll help some. Everything else was completely the norm for this month. Soap was good. Aftershave was nice. It's still really neat to see how the scent develops from the soap to the aftershave and then to the EdP. Speaking of which, yes I did 12 sprays today. I feel almost like Pigpen from Peanuts and that I've got a full on miasma of Stag billowing around me now. We shall see if someone comments on it today. If not, then 13 tomorrow. I'll honestly admit to y'all that I hope someone calls me out today. I don't wanna spray all my fragrance out this month!! But I'll do it in the name of science, curiosity, and some good 'ol fashioned smartassery and tomfoolery.",

It degraded a bit while stropping - and the fact my wife picked that time to kick me out of the bathroom for a few minutes probably didn't help - but after the post-strop touch-up, it stayed pretty strong through the shave.

Later on the Stag seemed to be working so I put some random background music on. After a bit, [Bad Horsie](https://youtu.be/BJfhFZ684SU) came on. I couldn't help but think this song matches the vibe of The Stag perfectly. I thought it was pretty awesome, albeit somewhat distracting. The Mrs thought the constant neighing was weird and turned it off. Regardless, I've found my theme song for the rest of the month.\n\n\n\n\nThe Personna is definitely starting to show its age after 12 shaves. It's not cutting quite as well and I'm making up for the lack of sharpness with speed and buffing. That might be a dangerous combo but it's forcing a lighter touch which is great. I still got a decent three pass shave and the sting of the splash was a perfectly minimal level.\n\n\n\n\n[Soap Weight Album](https://imgur.com/a/mdeswux)\n\n\n\n\n[Soap Usage Progress Album](https://imgur.com/a/rtrQlKP)\n\n\n\n\n[Brush Break In Progress Album](https://imgur.com/a/fCfOUq2)",

Still thinking I might want to buy one or two of them but I don't want to waste my money on something that isn't juuust right.\n\nNautica Voyage is cute (with its candy green apple and aquatic notes) but I usually don't find myself craving it, which is a pretty good sign that maybe I shouldn't have bought it. Oh well, it was only $16 and I know a couple dudes who might take it off my hands for me. I definitely like Chrome better than this, but... do I also like Invictus better?

Still rocking the 1 spray only and I feel like I smell it all day. I am definitely getting used to the smell though. It's not as off putting as it was initially.\n\nOne thing I have noticed from shaving everyday is that my technique has improved tremendously. The razor is easier to handle and I haven't had any nicks. I did have slight irritation on my neck the other day, but that was from going atg. I might just stick with xtg and live with it not being BBS.\n\nHope everyone is enjoying their Monday.",

I don't even remember what Seville smells like. Is Fresca Intensa real, or just a dream I had? Did my mind invent Darkfall just to keep me sane? Part of my brain tells me that razors weren't always this heavy, but I can't think of a time when they weren't. I cling to the fact that unlike those poor Stag-heads, I have frag freedom. But the siren song of phteven's brushes has made zombies of us. The phtiren phtong of phteven's bruphtes has made phtombies of us all!\n\nAll in all a good head shave this morning. Got a couple of nicks but nothing big... quick dab with the styptic pencil and done. Going with Weinstrasse again today. Again the very powdery, creamy opening. There's a bit of sweet fruit in there, grapes and vines, sweet and green and sharp. It's definitely in the same neighborhood as West Egg, but less bubbly and not quite as sweet. A bit more refined.\n\nThis morning's shave sound track was a variety of Dead Milkmen songs: I Dream of Jesus (\"Sis said it reminded her of an old TV show. Mom just slapped her and called her a heretic. I didn't say anything because I still remembered that time outside the Safeway when it took four security guards to hold mom down.\"), God's Kid Brother, and Punk Rock Girl (which then led over to Mojo Nixon's album Whereabouts Unknown, because if you ain't got Mojo Nixon then your store could use some fixin').",

That way it's in full effect when I venture out into the Wild. Yesterday, in honor of u/adoreyou, I sprayed 11 times on the neck and 5 more times down the shirt. It's no thirty sprays but I still argue that there's no scent multiplier. It's the same regardless of amount sprayed. I carried my 5ml Pocket Stag with me for hourly reapplications. I hit two sprays just before entering the cafe across the street from work and, while they didn't say anything, or look at me, or stop their conversation, or anything at all, I'm sure the table of cute girls noticed the amazingness of The Stag. As I was walking back across the street, I noticed an amazing smell that was strong and manly and sweet. This is me and it's amazing, I thought. I then realized that it was actually the midday sun heating up the fresh layer of asphalt that had been applied over the weekend. So, long story long, not only am I delusional, my nose my be broken as well.\n\n\n\nI'm trying out some Unscented preshave soap from Stirling. It's too soon to give any opinion so I'll report on that later as I get more time with it. The Personna felt a little rough today but I still got a really close shave with minimal splash burn so another day it goes.\n\n\n\n\nI'd like to give a shout out to u/wallygator88 who surprised me with some fat samples of Le Voyageur Grooming and Gentlemen's Nod. They smell great and now I'm looking forward to the end of the month even more. Thanks man, that was super cool of you!\n\n\n\n\n[Soap Weight Album](https://imgur.com/a/mdeswux)\n\n\n\n\n[Soap Usage Progress Album](https://imgur.com/a/rtrQlKP)\n\n\n\n\n[Brush Break In Progress Album](https://imgur.com/a/fCfOUq2)",

The results are about what you'd expect, but here's an [entertaining timelapse of it](https://imgur.com/a/CLd6tid).\n\nIf it weren't for the month, I'd consider this a stopping point on this blade. It can do 80% of the job fine, but the area around the mouth leaves much to be desired. Can't go against the grain in those areas so I settle for an extra XTG pass. I am definitely going noseblind to Stag. I applied some hair product before the shave and it was all I can smell, cutting through any of the scent from the lather. To make up for it and to ensure The Stag prevails, I did 20 sprays of EDT. I don't have no mini Stag like u/CosmoBarber so I need to front-load it in the morning.\n\nLife is short, live with The Stag",

I went with 13 sprays of the Stag today as well and RIGHT when I sprayed the final spray, I remembered my dentist appointment at 8:30. Fuck. This is the first time I'm meeting my new dentist and I guess I'm already establishing dominance, eh? Oh well. I just hope he overlooks the smell and doesn't ask questions haha.",

Unscented SBS shave soap keeps winning. Since I am bowl lathering I did something a little different today. I did not have time to wash the bowl out yesterday but left the soap to dry. I used the dried out lather today and reincarnated the soap back to life. Worked well. Now I don't scoop out a lot of soap to begin with so maybe a little \"new\" stuff remained. In any case the lather was fine. Perhaps this is a new version of austerity but I would not try this with williams. I suppose I should consider squeezing out the brush of excess soap back into the bowl after being done shaving for longer lasting austerity.",

It's not good enough to be close to $100 CAD on the grey market. However, I do have a gift certificate that can be traded at the local drug store for a full sized bottle of Invictus, Montblanc Explorer, or 8 other options that aren't quite as good or as expensive... At this point I basically need to decide whether I'm going to get myself a bottle of Invictus or my brother a bottle of Explorer for Christmas.\n\nI'm sort of leaning toward the Explorer gift because that means I don't have to think of something else to get for him.\n\nNacet is still giving me fine shaves. I'm also being very careful with the way I use the razor, though... *which is probably how I should always shave.*\n\n**Edit:** Reading about all's y'all's going nose-blind to Stag is *precisely* why I didn't want to pick one of my favorite scented soaps for AA. Ain't no way I want to wreck up my nose like that.\n\n**Update:** my nose completely failed to detect the aquatic notes in Invictus today. Not sure whether it's a nose problem or a skin chemistry thing, but it's a totally different experience than the last times I wore it. Much more bay and amber today. If it's this inconsistent for me I'd say it's not worth buying.",

Shorter load time than yesterday, and ended up with a very quick one, due to a simple face lathering process. Had some flaws, but very interesting.\n\n#### ❧ Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Timeless - Stainless Steel .68 - Open Comb ::: Gillette - Nacet ‹183 uses›)*\n\nClose shave, but a little tuggy on first pass. I think I blame the lather, or its application.\n\n#### ❧ Soap Notes\n*^(Chiseled Face - Midnight Stag)*\n\nI was wondering if I would pick up on different notes on this scent as I used it repeatedly. I haven't really. The only thing is that I don't get as strong of a gasoline scent from it as I used to.\n\nBut not picking up on anything new isn't really a bad thing. I already enjoy the scent a lot. That has probably just increased over time.\n\n\nScent Strength: 6/10, nicely present during shaving.\n\nLather: Loaded brush for 15 secs after shaking off a bit of water. Ended up with 4 passes maybe.\n\nneeded to add water each pass. And this time I remembered to put some water in my lather bowl, so adding water to the brush was a simple and quick partial dip.\n\nPretty good method. Very fast, compared to my usual bowl-lather. I felt like I had enough lather to do the job, and it felt good on my face.\n\nThe only down side was that I got more tugging than I usually do. Maybe I need to spend more time working it into my beard, or maybe it was a bit too dry at first.\n\n\n\n----\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Just a little tugging\n*Neck*: Just a little tugging\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Few hairs are showing some tip length (with most being cut flush)\n\n----\n\nDogwood Handcrafts' Midnight Stag Side Challenge is sponsored by the awesome dude behind [dogwoodhandcrafts.com](https://dogwoodhandcrafts.com/)\n\n[Austere August Intro Thread](/r/Wetshaving/comments/chv8g9/austere_august_2019)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm) *and also in the sub's sidebar.*\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

I dont know how this blade is going to last. Today I really noticed it tugging and I still have 17 more days to go.\n\nToday's Day in Grateful Dead History is a date I have been waiting for. This is a famous show during The Deads hiatus where they debut their album Blues for Allah. A crystal clear recording, a famous introduction by Bill Graham and some of the most amazing versions. If you cant listen to the whole thing, start with the introduction and at least listen to the Help>Slip>Franklins. Its my favorite version.\n\nGood Luck to all and have a great day!",

Still usable.\n\nI do know the wife is ready for the Aqua Velva to go. It's not that she despises it but she said she wished I would use Executive Man more often. When I tried to explain that I was using the same setup for an entire month for sweet, sweet internet points she just stared at me.\n\nA few minutes later she asked if that meant we could get rid of all my other gear.\n\nNo honey, no.",

The shave is smoother, with less irritation. I enjoyed seeing how far I could push the blade, but I'll be sticking to my 3 - 5 blade uses from now on. Life is too short for bad(ish) shaves.\n\nShave itself today was great, smooth and efficient. The soap scent and base continues to shine, its a great scent and base, although I'm secretly hoping I can kill this to give me an excuse to pick up the Icarus version next year.",

Just feels like a waste otherwise. As for the EdP, I did go with 14 sprays. It's a lot y'all. Speaking of wasteful, this is the peak right here. It's like I'm spraying FOREVER. I had a new doctor catch a good whiff of me in passing yesterday. She asked if I had car trouble or something and I busted out laughing like a tard. Told her it was my cologne and let her get a closer smell. She looked confused as shit when I tried to explain, so I just gave up. But still no complaints, so on I go with the extra sprays.",

There is no way that people can go unnoticed while spraying 10+ pumps of the edp. I think maybe some of us are losing our sense of smell or being desensitized to it. Similar to when you go camping. You don't realize how much you smell like smoke/campfire until you get home. The problem is this stuff lingers in the whole house so you can't tell. Perpetual cloud of Stag surrounds us.\n\n\nContinue to rock on Staggers.",

I dropped the load & drizzle time down from 120 seconds to 90 seconds (still having soaked the puck overnight) without much performance degradation.\n\nOn another note, the VPL brush is normally not a shedder but has been losing probably 1.5 hairs per shave on average for the last week or so. I worry that I've either been mashing it too hard while loading, or that daily use with no rotation is not allowing it to fully dry. I've backed off on the pressure while loading (the puck soaks have helped), and I don't think mildew would be able to degrade the knot this quickly, so I suppose I'll just monitor the problem.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHALLS OF THE DAMNED\nFINISHED\n\nKILLS: 45% (14/31)\nITEMS: 100% (5/5)\nSECRET: 0% (0/1)\n\nTIME: 20:30\nPAR: 15:00",

Pretty nice.\n\nShaves 2-4: rough and nicky. Too much burn and blood.\n\nShaves 5 and up: not \"so sharp the hairs just disappear\" sharpness any more, but no tugging ATG as long as I stick to a light touch and stay on top of my technique.

I was over an hour late to work. Thank goodness I had a great shave!\n\nThe Stag and I have merged to become one with each other and have a great understanding of who we are as entities. As our bond grows stronger so does our urge to be more and not just trapped in our bubble! Honestly, I just can't really smell the soap or AS much any more. I have to smell my hands to even get a whiff of it.\n\nAt least my wife hasn't complained once so far this month.

In the next couple days, we'll turn the corner and start on the back half of this month of madness. On July 1st, I was done with the Lather Games and ready to take a nice long break from all shaving related shenanigans and competitions. Then u/phteven_j showed up with that already ready already Valley of Ashes hybrid phandle and my stupid monkey brain lit up at the thought of an easy prize. All the other folks were going to do the Stag challenge so I figured the VoA challenge would be a sure thing. And almost as soon as I'd posted that first VoA SOTD, u/rmic_ showed up to turn my sure thing into a coin toss. All the Staggers have to do is finish out the month for a sure thing and there's a 50/50 chance I walk away with nothing to show for it but a significantly lighter tub of Valley of Ashes. And a well broken in B8 brush. And a thorough understanding of the mechanics of shaving with my Wolfman. Sure... I briefly thought about throwing the competition to my competitor at the very end if he simply didn't own a Dogwood hybrid... but then I realized he's using a Dogwood hybrid as his daily driver for the month. That's when I decided I needed to bring in the ninja assassins. Granted, I'm on a budget here... after all, it *is* Austere August. So I'm lift with third-rate ninja assassins who can't seem to do much more than make my opponent's family mildly ill. You get what you pay for, I suppose.\n\nAnother good shave with VoA. Decided to go with the VoA frag today to celebrate the two week mark. I did palm strop the GSB again last night. Hard to tell if it made much of a difference.

And this time I remembered to put some water in my lather bowl, so adding water to the brush was a simple and quick partial dip.\n\nPretty good method.

I had been feeling this blade lose steam the last few shaves but today was much smoother than I expected. No nicks, no irritation...didn't even reach for the alum. Easy St splash may have also helped. I picked this up for $8 on BST and it was among my best wet shaving purchases to date. Very happy with the performance of this splash--the scent is pleasant and fresh but not obtrusive at all, and it has a nice menthol kick.",

The soaps almost at the ring of death, holding it up to a window there's almost a bit of daylight.\n\nI got some samples from Kerosene a few days ago so I've been making my way through them. Santalum Silvers is a great scent that fits F&P really well. Its a nice citrusy scent with a woody, peppery follow up. Its a nice contract to the sharp, tart scent of F&P. Definitely a contender for a full bottle.",

Having done the white paper version so many times I was surprised how challenging this version was. It turned out pretty well, plus I have enough paper to get better at it.\n\nI did my shave after the wife left for work, which is a rarity. With her change in start time plus commute with my work-out routine it just pushes my shower and shave from first thing to last thing in the morning. Luckily I work a job with flexible hours, otherwise the daily shaves could be in peril. 11 sprays of EDT, I observed the bubble on top has expanded to the entire perimeter of the bottle, which is a good sign. The aftershave hasn't diminished a lot either, so I feel that when the soap is actually done, there will be plenty of the liquid elements to support another tub.\n\nLife is Stag, shave with short.",

Another day, another shave. Still had to buff several places and I'm beginning to get a bit raw, so I may hafta skip BBS a couple of days to let it heal. And before anyone asks, yes. I'm at 15 sprays today. The bad thing about today is that I hafta go to the nursing home for a bit before work and I'm not sure how the Stag will go over in there. It's a nice place, as far as nursing homes go, and some of the people (both residents and employees) are a bit...snooty for lack of a better word. Hopefully I can dart in, get the paperwork I need, and dart out before anyone really catches a good whiff of my Stagness. I'll let y'all know if anything worth mentioning happens.",

Can't believe it took a week to realize that the house wasn't getting any cooler every time I tried to turn the AC down.\n\nSure wish I'd had access to all my mentholated splashes to help handle the heat over the past week... damned silly Austere August unscented hibber jibber razmataz...\n\nOrdered a couple cute brush handles from China (wasn't sure which one will fit best). Gonna order a 24mm SHD badger bulb from Maggard when Fougère Angelique is released. Hoping I don't have to end up putting one of the handles into the lathe or under the drill press to make things fit... I'd really rather avoid that.\n\nThe cosmetician down the street gave me an Eau Fraiche sample that I forgot about until I stumbled upon it in my closet last night. Woody aquatic with citruses up top? Frequent comparisons to Azzaro Chrome Sport (which I am somewhat familiar with)? Might as well give it a shot while I'm in the \"freshie\" neighborhood. I'll post my impressions later.",

Tomorrow those numbers flip. Also tomorrow, u/rmic_ is free to use whatever soap he wants since my third-rate ninjas managed to sneak some unscented SW into his VoA tub causing him to inadvertently disqualify himself from our little competition this morning. Also, can we talk about how u/CosmoBarber has let the Stag go to his head? Now he's talking about \"Stag Strong\" and how much people around him are enjoying the aroma of Stag. I think he's developed a case of Stagholm Syndrome and I think we're going to need to arrange an intervention at the end of the month.\n\nToday was a head shave day for me. The VoA lathered up nicely and the Wolfie got me from kinda fuzzy to BBS in 2 passes. I have to agree somewhat with u/rmic_... I am missing my alcohol splashes. I'm also missing menthol (or synthetic menthol) in this 80-degree weather. Maybe it will stay warm into September and I'll be able to enjoy that Orbit I ordered yesterday.\n\nFinished up with the VoA EdP today because I'm celebrating making it halfway through. Also, I'm wondering just how far I can push this blade. It's made it to 15 shaves and I don't doubt it's going to go to 31. Should I try for the Century Club? If I keep shaving every day, I just have to make it to November 8th on this blade. Do I keep it in the same razor? Do I move it between razors? Do I set it aside and use it every now and then so that it can hit the century mark during next year's Lather Games?",

I think all too often it's easy to blame the razor, or the soap, or whatever, but in reality, it's often our technique. For example, I was getting so so shaves over the course of this month so far, and then, I really took some time to think about what was going well in my previous years, and what wasn't. It turns out that I was holding the razor at a slightly off angle for what is needed for an injector. And so, today I paid a lot of attention to that, and got a great shave.",

I'm going to experiment to try to create a better lather that lasts all three passes. Razor + blade combo felt great; mild and efficient shave. I'm stilling getting little weepers so I might be overbuffing some areas. Mild post shave to wrap it all up.\n\nNow now now... my purchases this month hasn't really reflect Austerity. I might have gone a lil wild but here we go. As I said before, I have a Semogue 830 and Slim adjustable on the way. Also, I got myself a Schick Krona so I'm excited. Also, I got myself a whole bunch of seasonal Stirling samples!! Getting ready to smell some fruity goodness. I'm still restraining myself but I might be on that fine line currently.. haha.",

See, I used Leviathan AS in here at one point, left it there for a few weeks, and much to my dismay, when I needed it but didn't check, I found it was empty. Maybe the cap wasn't tightened enough? It smelled vaguely like Leviathan, but not enough to hold its own against Stag the Champion.\n\nAs for the trip, I'm not really looking forward to it. We're taking a trip to see the in-laws for my wife's Dad's birthday. We were just there three weeks ago (I recall having the discussion with my wife about purchasing a set of Stag and shaving with it for a month in her parent's kitchen), so that's the first part, 5 hour trips aren't really much fun. Secondly, we had a traumatic experience between our dog and our nephew last time we were there. Her sister and her husband aren't fan of dogs, much less big dogs (actually this kinda extends to her dad as well), so anytime they are over they expect our dog to be quarantined in the basement. As an aside, it's not just our dog that he requests to be out of his presence, but her parents toy poodle puppy has been deemed not worthy because she simply runs and behaves faster than he can keep up with, which freaks him out. Not your typical basement, there's no door and it's kinda designed like a split-level basement, open stairwell, etc. They use a simple cardboard box as a \"gate\" which keeps him down there. Well, if they understood our dog and gave him a chance, they'd realize he loves people, needs a minute to get his energy out, but once he does that he's [no threat](https://i.imgur.com/hF0VBMn.jpg). They never give him that chance, so he is just amped up all the time, whining to come up. So back to the traumatic bit, our nephew is 3+ years old, and per his request, he wanted to see him. My sister-in-law was fearful so carried him down the stairs, but as they made their way past the \"gate\", our dog jumped up to get a closer look at our nephew, sending him into a full-blown, screaming panic. As we all tried to re-assure him and calm him down, he clearly changed his mind about the whole situation, and one of the things the sister-in-law said was \"I know he's big and he can hurt you\". This did not go over well with my wife, and they had an argument, followed by a second argument without the child present. Voices were raised, made it all really uncomfortable for the rest of us, and the sister-in-law plus her family abruptly packed up and left. They have since \"reconciled\" but my wife admits that the problem hasn't been solved, it was just an apology. So it's back to walking on eggshells with our dog. I'll admit, it's hard seeing it from their point of view when my whole family has embraced him, even my sister with her daughter who doesn't have any dogs. The fact that we don't have kids (another story of its own) seems to diminish our viewpoint of the situation, to quote \"we just don't understand\".\n\nLife is short, shave with Stag.",

To shake things up a bit, I shaved with the smallest amount of water possible in my soap, just to see how it would go. Wasn't the worst thing ever, but it surely wasn't the best either. I might use slightly more water tomorrow and see how that goes. Also, just to maybe make me feel better, I just wanna day that I miss menthol in my shave. I've been adding copious amounts of Cryogen soap to the bottom of my shave bowl that I then take a loaded brush to, to give me a super chilly shave. Obviously can't do that and so my face has sorely missed that glorious tingliness. Is it September yet? Finally, before the anticipation kills anyone...I did 16 sprays. I don't know how much longer I can keep wasting this dark liquid gold, but curiosity has kept me going. I wonder what the final straw will be. 19? 22? I suppose we'll all find out together!",

Since bowl lathering as of late, I was too lazy to rinse out the bowl of lather from yesterday and reused the remains for today. I am going to keep this going to see how long I can milk it, adding no new soap. So we will call this day 2 of the soap reanimation project. Man, am I that bored? Username makes sure of that. Like others have stated the daily postings of the same thing is a drag. I would be using the same thing regardless although I probably would not reuse leftover soap. How austere can one be?",

I will not let my guard down now that we're in the second half of the competition.\n\nI made sure to double check all the windows and doors last night to make sure those third rate ninjas would not be able to find a way in. Desperate times also call for desperate measures so I safely stashed all my AA gear and [left a decoy set](https://imgur.com/a/VOsExSf) out for those third rate ninjas. They definitely took the bait because the set was tampered with and out of place when I checked it this morning. Thankfully my AA gear was safely where I left it and I had a really great shave.\n\nHappy Friday to all!\n\n[VoA Soap Usage Album](https://imgur.com/a/yNe79P2)\n\n[VoA Soap Weight Album](https://imgur.com/a/GE4HsK2)",

If the Stag keeps this up I may not be able to use anything else~. I go on-call tonight until next Friday and I HAAAAAAAAAATE being on-call. We don't usually get a lot of calls but just not knowing when I might get paged fills me with so much anxiety that even getting paid for being on-call doesn't make it worth it.\n\nI tried having my son (almost 4) watch Spaceballs the other day.....yeah, that didn't last long. I hadn't seen the move in a couple of years (maybe more) and I didn't remember it having as much cursing in it as it did, so I had to turn it off. He did like that it \"looked like Star Wars\" though, so one day I will show it to him when he is at a more appropriate age (your time will come my young padawan).\n\nBack to the shave. My face is smoother than yesterday and I am getting the hang of having one side of my razor being more mild than the other. It really helps me on my chin to get those hard to reach places. I am going to try (in September of course) my Razorock Lupo I just got yesterday but the weight of it worries me. It is pretty light so it may take me a little time to get use to it.\n\nAnywho, it's Friday and the start of the freakin weekend! Make it a good one!\n\nEdit: Grammar",

Comparing it to these aquatic freshies this week to see how it holds up against them, since I already know it seems weak compared to heavier fougères.\n\nSkipping out on the last two frags that I had planned because I'm fairly unenthusiastic about them. This latest batch of fragrances just ended up confirming that I like the perfumes I already have (phew) and wasn't too excited about the ones I haven't spent money on (PHEW) aside from Legend, which can be had for pretty cheap if I really want it. Instead I'm going to take the weekend off from the Perfumery Tour and just... I dunno, put on something pleasant that I feel like wearing? Weird.\n\n**Update:**\n\nDamn folks do I ever love the way Legend smells. I think I need to buy it ~~even though the longevity tends to be hella weak~~ *because the performance has surprised me the last couple times I wore it, being better than when I first tried it.* Thank goodness it's only $35 for a full bottle on the grey market.",

I should have listened to my wife and just used TaskRabbit. But no... I had to have real ninjas. SMH.\n\nAnother good shave with the VoA. I think the razor blade might be getting a bit draggy.

I did not soak the brush today and that significantly improved the performance. No lather eating phenomenon but just great shave. Razor + blade felt great but I did get more weepers than the usual. I'll give the blade one more try tomorrow and see. Mild post shave to wrap it all up.\n\nI'm excited to get my mail call! The first one will be Semogue 830 + Slim adjustable. I'll probably clean those up and put them on display until Austere August ends. Can't wait to shave with these new items!",

So I've become unable to handle my alcohol since having a child and my large can of 8.5% beer got me way more drunk than it should of done. Why is this important? Because like when trying to dance and sing whilst drunk it turns out your shaving improves too! I loaded less soap than I normally do and added more water and the lather was amazing, far slicker than normal. I thought I was already adding enough water, turns out you can always have more water. Then during the shave itself I adjusted a few lines of strokes to do 45 degree angles on my neck rather than north / south, and again it worked way better than normal.\n\nSo there's a few more things for me to try and replicate during my next few shaves and if I can't I guess the real takeaway is that I should always shave drunk?",

This 5:00 AM crap can stop any time now.\n\nFortunately the shave was excellent as usual and this blade is humming along nicely. I am actually pleasantly surprised how well it is performing. I wish I could have gone with the full Stag set for AA so I could smell more like Stag. I love reading all the other Stagsters shenanigans with all their sprays and wish I too could contribute my own tales of similar tom-foolery. Unfortunately I am on a tight budget so I had to sacrifice the EdT. The good news is, Stag isn't going anywhere and I'll be getting the full set soon.\n\nStag has a place in my heart and also in my shave rotation! Happy Saturday to all!\n\nEdit: Spelling",

On one hand, ugh, what a lot of work. On the other hand, cool... I do enjoy collecting data.\n\n~~Not sure yet if I'll wear perfume today. Will see where the whims take me.~~ Today I tried out the early 1990 budget cologne Preferred Stock. The bottle, packaging, and advertisements are *painfully* dated. The scent, on the other hand, is *delightfully* dated. Preferred Stock is one of those fragrances that I would bluntly describe as \"smells like aftershave,\" which along with \"smells like shaving foam\" are my favorite style of fougère. I'm not sure I can put it into much more detail, but I can paint a broad picture: metallic citrus splash, slightly camphorous lavender, smoky clary sage and evergreen woods, and moss and leather in the base. It's in approximately the same style as Drakkar Noir, but you'd never confuse them with each other. As the drug store down the street has a bottle on sale for $23 (which is hardly any more than buying it on the internet) I think I shall wander down there tomorrow night when my favorite cosmetician is working and let her have the commission.\n\nRegularly scheduled fragrances will return Monday with a slew of *extremely fancy fragrances.*\n\n*****\n\nAfter hurrying through my favorite \"freshies\" this week and ruling out a few poor choices, I think my two favorites are Chrome and Legend. Legend always concerned me in the past with its poor performance but now I think I was just applying it improperly. The last few wearings have offered at least arm's-length projection until supper and skin scent well into the evening. When my wife picked me up after work today she even remarked on how strong it was, which is pretty good for the 9 hour mark. I will buy a bottle with my next fragrance order.\n\nNautica Voyage, which I already own, is nice but not as good as the first two, so I might try to pass it off to a friend. It's starting to feel like a *childish* flanker of Chrome to me, which I don't like as much as the *youthful* vibe I get from Chrome. (There's a difference.) I wish I had noticed that before I bought both of them.\n\nInvictus surprised me by smelling totally different than it did the last time I wore it, which was weird and unwelcome. Versace Man Eau Fraiche was a complete disappointment and a waste of time. YSL L'Homme, which I tried but didn't write about, was reasonably nice but not quite my style (and costs more than I like to spend). Definitely worth trying out if you're into woody-floral-musks though!",

Today is a yearly health fair that I've been helping out with for the past few years now. It's at a church here in town and not just any church: it's a stereotypical black Southern Baptist church, slap full of folks that I've known five-ever and won't hesitate to loudly call me out in front of God and everybody else. So this will most definitely be interesting this mornin. I'll be taking blood pressures all day, so I'll be all up in everyone's business haha. Wish me luck. I'm gonna need it!",

Yo.\n\nToday's Day in Grateful Dead History is a great show from 1989. The years 1987 (post Jerry coma) up to Brent's death in 1990 were some of the best. Jerry was healthy and the band seemed so energized. I love when they came out of Space into The Wheel. If the thunder don't get ya then the lightning will!\n\nGood Luck to all and have a great day!",

It was just the right amount of aggression to not irritate, and it was so smooth i barely felt the blade. It's the winner so far.",

I see the light at the end of the tunnel. Someone please tell me it's not a train. When I got home from work yesterday, there was a Zingariman box sitting by the front door. In addition to the unscented post-shave balm, the box contained a variety of Zingari Man shave soap samples. I suspect this was the work of my opponent. He's attempting to derail my Austere August run by dangling new soaps in front of me. But it's not going to work! I'm going to stay strong. I'm going to stick with VoA to the end of the month and I'm going to win that coin toss.\n\nI palm-stropped the GSB before shaving this morning and I feel like it was less tuggy than yesterday. The big change this morning was after my ~~stagnant Chattahoochee River water~~ VoA aftershave dried down, I applied some Zingari Man unscented balm. It's hard to tell how much of my face happiness right now is due to the balm as opposed to the SW splash. As Ruds noted in his review, the balm is basically scent-free. It didn't interfere at all with the lingering smell of VoA. It is also very light and absorbs quickly. Maybe once AA is over, I'll take some time to do side-by-side comparisons of Zingari's balm with Stirling balm and Declaration liniment. Or maybe I'll wind up being too lazy to do that. Who can tell?",

Those third-rate fools bumped into all the furniture, left a trail of candy bar wrappers and Rudy or \"Rudiey\" as the cup says, left his mocha frappachino behind the couch for baby girl to find. The sugar and caffeine overload gave her a second wind late in the day and she blew past her bed time last night. Very unprofessional to say the least. u/BourbonInExile and I might need to go halfsies on the TaskRabbit ninja. It is Austere August after all and our wallets are meant to be saving money for the upcoming releases.\n\nI really love the packaging of the soap and splash. I keep wondering how much of the splash is left but the packaging is so dark I can't even tell how much I have used but it definitely feels like I have 75% or more left.\n\n[VoA Soap Usage Album](https://imgur.com/a/yNe79P2)\n\n[VoA Soap Weight Album](https://imgur.com/a/GE4HsK2)",

Wow. It really doesn't feel like it's been damn near 3 weeks of nonstop Stag-ification. Still not tired of it, but I REALLY miss the variety of my norm. Woke up a bit later than I meant to this mornin thanks to my genius idea to drink a few last night and watch something on Netflix that I've been meaning to for a while. If you like The Lonely Island and haven't seen The Unauthorized Bash Brothers Experience, you need to fix that. I stumbled upon the album on Spotify and listened to it nonstop for a week or so and then found the damn thing on Netflix yesterday so boom. There was my entertainment for the night. Oh and yep. I did 18 sprays. This was the first time my wife was in the room and asked me about it. She said she typically doesn't smell it on me without looking for it, but she was taken aback by my cloud of it during the spraydown. Still not enough of a complaint imo to justify stopping now. Hell, I may just end up doin the full 31 sprays by the end of the month.",

It's pretty cute but it's big and heavy. I'm gonna clean it up and put it down in the hobby room in the basement (when the basement is done) and use it as a storage cabinet for my perfume collection. Not gonna plug it in though - it's a noisy power hog.\n\nPreferred Stock was reeeeally fun yesterday. A little harsh in the heart notes for a while, but then what classic green fragrance isn't? Paco Rabanne, Azzaro, Polo... they all have their nasty moments, but their virtues more than make up for it. Going to the mall later to visit one of the few stores in the province that stocks Chanel's male fragrances. I hear they have some PE in stock... hopefully they have a tester bottle so I can try it out. I keep hearing that it inspired a lot of '90s grooming products so maybe it'll scratch that itch for me.\n\n**Update:**\n\nFound a bottle of Egoiste Platinum. Sprayed it. Wore it. Was not as expected. I've heard time and time again through the years that it smells a lot like Gillette products from the '90s. I suppose it does bear a certain resemblance to the discontinued Wild Rain line, which lives on in the form of Reserve Waves. Sort of aquatic-floral, clean, fresh laundry. Similar vibe to Azzaro Chrome. Nice, but not remotely what I was looking for. Bummer.",

We were going out to dinner and of course I needed a fresh coating of awesomeness on my clean shirt. I only hit five sprays and then we immediately got into a hot car. She rolled down the window and blew air out of her nose while saying, \"Too strong\". RESULT!\n\n\n\nGot another fine shave today. Light pressure and short buffing strokes. This soap is pretty versatile in how much water it can handle. It's very easy to work with.\n\n\n\nHope all of you Austeriters are enjoying your weekend. ^(I miss the smells)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Soap Weight Album](https://imgur.com/a/mdeswux)\n\n\n\n\n[Soap Usage Progress Album](https://imgur.com/a/rtrQlKP)\n\n\n\n\n[Brush Break In Progress Album](https://imgur.com/a/fCfOUq2)",

I really appreciate it. The packaging was top notch and the lollipop was a nice touch. The soap smells amazing and it's really making me regret this AA month. I miss the variety. I have new soaps to try, and Stag is too rugged for me, but I need to keep my eye on the prize. This is my first vintage Gillete. The TTO feature is really impressive and seems easy to load a blade. I will post an update when I get to use it in September.\n\nMoving on to SOTD. It was a smooth shave to start my work week. Touched up the neck area again and no irritation. I think I have to go a few days between shaves with the neck since I'm quite sensitive there. Stag still performing as expected. Can't wait to see all the WTS and PIF's of Stag when this month is up.\n\nHappy Sunday AA'ers!",

Their plane was scheduled to land at 10:50PM and so I left the house about quarter after 9 to go pick them up. I arrived at the Bainbridge ferry terminal at 9:30, right on time to make it onto the 9:45 sailing. But as I pulled my car down into the suspiciously short waiting line, I could see that the boat gliding across Eagle Harbor was going out, not coming in. I opened up the Vessel Watch page on my phone and discovered that what I was seeing was the 8:55 ferry departing at 9:31. The 9:45 ferry was still docked on the Seattle side. My carefully timed plan was blown because u/rmic_ somehow found a way to disrupt the Washington State Ferries (which, coincidentally, was the 4th place finisher on the Seattle Times poll for names for our new NHL team, though with slightly different spelling). I made it to the airport, picked up the fam, and we headed back to the ferry dock only to discover that we'd missed the boat by 15 minutes and we'd hit the time of night where they go down to 1 boat, so we sat there until 12:45 waiting for the boat to come back. 15 minutes of loading, a 35 minute crossing, and 15 minute drive later and we got home right about 2am. I'm sure my opponent thought I wouldn't have time to shave this morning due to sleeping in. But I showed him!\n\nBlah blah blah can't believe the blade is still going on shave 18. Blah blah same gear as yesterday and you're all getting tired of hearing about it. Counting down the days to freedom. I want to use Orbit. I want to use my Zingari Man samples. I want to enjoy variety again. And I know I could give up the competition tomorrow (and so could u/rmic_) and satisfy my desire for variety... but that phandle is calling me. It's scared of going home with my opponent. It wants to come live next to Boba Fett on my brush shelf. So I have a duty to rescue it.",

Started out kind of weird, just sooooo much water... Then it got very messy and spilled all over the sides and didn't really seem that much better. Kept swirling. Did this for over a minute before lathering one of my legs. Seemed to work pretty good as I continued my shave, but I'm not sure if it was any faster or better... May try it again depending upon how I feel.\n\nGiven that this is the same blade I used during the later half of lather games, it's getting pretty rough. I can definitely feel it. And I nicked myself. Overall, an okay shave, I guess.",

I was wondering when I was going to make it through. Still have plenty left, but maybe I don't load as heavy for a few days so I can ration it to the end of the month.\n\nThe shave was smooth and free of nicks, weepers, and irritation. I put a little twist on the head so the blade wasn't running exactly perpendicular to the direction I was pulling (I guess like a manual slant). I got a really smooth draw. Going to try that tomorrow and see if I get similar results.\n\nHappy Monday!\n\nedit: spelling/grammar - pre-coffee posting is hard",

First, I spread the soap much much thinner in the bottom of my loading bowl. I didn't use any less soap. Just spread what I grabbed around in a thinner layer. This let me pick the soap up much more quickly and I made the Lather in half the time. The second new thing I did was I painted some water into the lather on my face immediately before shaving and just left it. In the past I always painted some water on and then scrubbed it in more. I still did that to get the Lather where I wanted it, but then just painted a little more water on without scrubbing. This seemed to leave it just as thick but much more slick. I still don't get much if any residual slickness though. Ended up with an excellent, and very comfortable shave.\n\n\n\nWe're inside of two weeks remaining guys and gals! Keep up the good fight!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Soap Weight Album](https://imgur.com/a/mdeswux)\n\n\n\n\n[Soap Usage Progress Album](https://imgur.com/a/rtrQlKP)\n\n\n\n\n[Brush Break In Progress Album](https://imgur.com/a/fCfOUq2)",

No, obviously I didn't shave with it, but I burned one of Shawn's candles in here last night. Why, you ask? Although we've lived in our house for 3 years now, when we are gone for the weekend and return Sunday, we find it smells... off. No stinky garbage, no mess in the fridge, but it almost smells like the old homeowners, at least that's my wife's opinion. I think we ought to get the carpets cleaned...\n\nI had some fun this morning, I nabbed some crayons from the pizza place we went to yesterday. The one table had a sizable paper tablecloth for the kids, you know, with games and stuff. Unfortunately I wasn't in prime position to take advantage of the canvas and was unable to convert it into a shrine for Midnight Stag. Worse yet, I forgot to reapply the EDT before going and didn't get any reaction out of it, so what a bummer.\n\n8 sprays of EDT and I can no longer smell YRP.\n\nLife is short, shave with Stag.",

To spice things up this time, I added water and added water and added water until the lather broke and then shaved with that watery mess. Little to no protection for today's shave. I had to relather between every pass and was reminded that I couldn't buff anything pretty early on. Felt like I clawed my left cheek slap off. Finally heard my first almost complaint today from my wife. She said: \"Damn. How many sprays are you using today? Lemme guess, fifty eleven thousand million?\" Then she proceeded to move our fan to blow directly at me and away from her and then plopped her face directly in the bed. She never actually verbally complained though, so onto 20 tomorrow unless something changes at work!",

I hope everyone's week will get off to a great start and everyone had a fulfilling weekend.\n\nToday I'm starting the week of with the luxurious lime offering produced by Colonel Ichabod Conk. This soap is a beautiful rendition of a pure lime scent. There is nothing to obstruct the unadulterated and raw lime fragrance that will coat your face for the next hour or two. Once lathered the soap provides a great amount of slickness to the blade.\n\nAs /u/Fahrenheit915 now solely sells Colonel Conk, everyone should take the opportunity to help them become the number one vendor for this delightful soap.\n\nHope everyone has a wonderful day.",

Took a few days off to let my neck heal and it still wasn't ready but I couldn't stand the itching any longer. Going to need to take a couple more days again, I've got some cool fix coming which will hopefully help. First pass was a little rough with the guarded blade on multiple days growth but the 2nd and 3rd were smooth as butter. Such a great and relaxing weekend, wonderful AMA on Saturday with the people's champ Will C. If any of you are UFC fans Saturday nights fight card was incredible, best PPV I've seen in awhile. Early day at work but leaving early to get to a baby appointment with the wife, we'll see how soon this bun is going to come out of the oven. Happy Monday!",

Much to my consternation, I found that the battery to my mower would not report any charge and the charger wouldn't recognize that it was plugged in. It's well within the warranty period, so I'll have to dig up the receipt and take it back to Lowe's.\n\nOn the shaving front, I once again omitted the overnight puck soak, just soaking the brush and soap together in the mug. The lather was as good as I've gotten with Williams, so I don't think a long soak is necessary once you've established a hydrated layer on the top. Little or no sting from the aftershave, so the edge is holding up well to boot - not that it shouldn't, as I've only got about 25 shaves on it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPANDEMONIUM\nFINISHED\n\nKILLS: 61% (19/31)\nITEMS: 100% (5/5)\nSECRET: 0% (0/1)\n\nTIME: 19:30\nPAR: 15:00",

I have no doubt about the longevity of the blade so I suspect that I didn't get enough of my Monday tears into the lather. I get to do it all again tomorrow and for 11 days after that, but who is keeping count, not this guy, so I'm not really worried. u/BourbonInExile and I will keep chanting VoA all day, VoA everyday until the end, of the competition that is, unless one of us cracks.\n\nI already know I'm not participating in Sample September this year. There is too much stuff I'm planning to use once AA ends and I don't want to hold off not using them any longer.\n\n[VoA Soap Usage Album](https://imgur.com/a/yNe79P2)\n\n[VoA Soap Weight Album](https://imgur.com/a/GE4HsK2)",

It's going to be low-70s and clowdy. It would have been a lovely day to use Fenchurch. I've even got the Fenchurch frag from Secret Santa that I haven't used yet. But I'm staying strong. Nearly 2/3 of the way through Austere August and my MRTNG's Ultra Nightmare Mode run is intact. Finish strong. Ignore the siren song of u/ntownuser. Reach for the VoA. There's plenty of time for Fenchurch later. Keep your eyes on the ~~coin flip~~ prize.\n\nLather was a little flat this morning. I think it's because I kind of rushed things. Had to get ready in time to get the little human ready for camp. This isn't the last week of her summer, but it is the last week I have to get her ready for camp in the mornings. Anyway, lather was a little flat, but still got a great shave. Two passes (WTG, XTG) and I'm very nearly BBS. I continued following up the VoA splash with Zingari Man unscented balm after letting the splash dry for a few minutes. I look forward to pairing the balm with the soap samples it came with next month.\n\nOn a final note, I didn't see any obvious signs of interference or obstruction from u/rmic_ today, which probably means he's working on something big to drop on me in the home stretch. Well, dude... Do your worst. I am strong and focused and ain't nothing gonna break my stride. Also, if anyone out there knows of second-rate ninjas that work for third-rate ninja rates, PM me.",

The brush is working decently and it makes enough lather for 4+ passes. Razor + blade is working efficiently without much irritation. I did not get any weepers today so success! Mild post shave to wrap it all up.\n\nOhhhh man. Getting some serious gears in the mail. Got couple vintages and the brush that I wanted, etcs. Can't wait for this month to end!

The lack of variety is starting to get to me. Just under two weeks until I can bust out my other soaps and splashes. Wait for me my friends...\n\nStill got a good shave with no nicks, weepers, or irritstion, but I feel like I might be reaching the red line for this blade. It just isn't as comfortable any more. It'll make the end of AA, but it may be time for a new one shortly afterwards. The spun head angle does make a difference though, so that helps quite a bit.\n\nHappy Tuesday!",

Unfortunately, even shaving isn't an escape from it, what with contouring your face to get the angles, or trying to avoid getting shaving cream in your mouth or up your nose. 8 sprays of EDT to round things out, can't believe some of you are (or rather, one of you is) using 20!\n\nLife is short, shave with Stag.",

I did this with some trepidation, as my initial less-than-successful lathers with this soap were face lathers. The difference here are that the soap has developed what I call a hydrated layer on the top (from repeated soakings and daily use), and this time after vigorously loading for about ~30s I then face lathered for a period of time that I would quantify as \"forever\", introducing water v . e . r . y s . l . o . w . l . y through the process. There were two different times when I though the lather couldn't take more water and was going to collapse, but I just kept going. The result was a pretty good lather that didn't dissipate or dry out during the shave. Finally! I'm just about ready to call this problem solved.\n\nAlso, I used some CA glue to fix the broken mug yesterday night, and it seems to be holding up.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHOUSE OF PAIN\nFINISHED\n\nKILLS: 65% (20/31)\nITEMS: 100% (5/5)\nSECRET: 0% (0/1)\n\nTIME: 20:30\nPAR: 15:00",

I consider that a win.\n\n\n\n\nStill managing to make this lather a little bit better each day. I got a very close shave but started to pay the left handed ATG tax with a couple weepers.

I mean, it happened yesterday after 19 sprays for God's sake and it's gonna feel even more like a waste if no one complains and I keep goin with the sprays. As for the shave itself, I properly hydrated and got a pretty damn nice shave. Still stuck buffing in spots, but I'll chase that BBS, everything else be damned. It's a weird compulsion and I know it's wrong and stupid but I can't help myself and do it anyway. I'm addicted to the smoothness!",

Replacement blade is ok but I'm not sure why it feels a little rough. In any case a mediocre shave but prep was rushed. I had to shave around some ingrown hair areas so I am still paying some consequences from a couple days ago. I had to use tend skin on part of my throat so maybe I am not so austere anymore :-)\n\nI also think the V3M is not super efficient but maybe my prep was not as good as it could be. The SBS soap is still excellent so its probably just lack of beard prep. Hopefully your shave went better than mine.",

A fruity chypre inspired by the life of Emperor Napoleon, a man who would reportedly go through two to three bottles of cologne a day to mask the stench of war, a man who loved perfume so much that he carried a flask of cologne hidden in his boot on the battlefield. (Newman, Cathy. *Perfume*. Washington DC: National Geographic Society, 1998.)\n\nCreed's marketing for Aventus proclaims it to be built on \"twelve\" scent notes, each selected from a place that Napoleon either lived or conquered. Of course, [ad copy isn't the same as an ingredient list](https://www.fragrantica.com/news/What-is-the-Secret-of-Aventus-by-Creed--10196.html) - it's more a way to highlight the most marketable facets of the melange of aromachemicals (both natural and synthetic) that make up a perfume. A less romantic / more blunt note breakdown of Aventus might look more like this:\n\nThings | Aventus | Kinda | Smells | Like\n:--------|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:\n**Early Notes** | Pineapple | Apple | Citruses | Berries\n**Heart Notes** | White Florals | Patchouli | Blond Woods | Earthy Woods\n**Under Tones** | Musk | Ambers | Leather | Moss\n\nA little more broad than [the usual list](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Creed/Aventus-9828.html), no? Still, that's the breakdown I'm going to work with this week because a) it's convenient for my next three fragrance posts, b) that's the best way I can interpret the 3rd-party research I've perused, and c) **that's how the stuff smells:**\n\nTo MY nose, Aventus opens with pineapple, apple, and citruses. That doesn't last long before it starts melting into a white floral heart accord dominated by hedione and lyral (jasmine-ish and lily of the valley-ish). I think it's the white florals more than the fruits that provide the sweet bubble that projects around the wearer during the heart of the fragrance, but it's such a seamless transition from fruity sweetness to floral sweetness that you practically miss it happening. On my skin it took maybe 15 minutes to shift from fruit to floral, and about three or four hours before the floral notes faded away.\n\nUnderneath those highlights and hearty florals are the heart notes and under tones. The heart notes arrive pretty quickly and grow in strength as the perfume warms up on your skin. The mixture of woody notes dominate down at skin level but aren't as diffusive as the sweet top, so you need to be much closer to notice them. Right up against the skin it's extremely dry and woody, like mashing your face against a sheet of fresh-sanded birch plywood. From a distance it's a milder woody patchouli scent that blends with the sweeter notes. (Perhaps that's the \"smoky sweetness\" many reviewers refer to?) The woody heart faded from my skin after four or five hours.\n\nThe final under tones of the fragrance are really there the whole time, but they're generally overpowered by the rest of the fragrance until the top and heart burn off. They're a classic retro masculine blend of musks, ambers, leathery nuances, and \"oakmoss\"...but I'ma call bullshit on that last one because they don't disclose any mosses in their EU-mandated ingredient list; it has some mossy depth and smoothness, but it's likely a synthetic substitute. I really enjoy this base and the way it recalls male perfumes of yesteryear.\n\n**So is it good stuff?** Yes. It's very nice. The realistic apple and pineapple notes were moderately novel a decade ago; the transition from sweet fruit to sweet white florals is seamless; the contrast between the sweet top and overtly macho base makes for a lovely pairing; and the late drydown has a snuggly, comforting, familiar vintage vibe.\n\nAside from the high quality apple and pineapple, there's nothing truly groundbreaking about it, either today or when it was released a decade ago, in my opinion: Aventus just repackaged old ideas in a very well-crafted and well-marketed manner, reminding us of the potential of leathers and ambers and woods after two decades dominated by aquatics and fresh fougères. Creed were definitely standing on the shoulders of giants when they designed Aventus *and there's nothing wrong with that:* that's how progress is made. In the past decade everyone under the sun has stepped up and stood on Creed's shoulders, releasing one Aventus-inspired fragrance after another. Some are slavish recreations, some offer a slight twist, and others just find inspiration to create something new and interesting. That's progress, baby.\n\nToday I'll wear L'Aventure by Al Haramain, a sweet citrusy twist on the classic Aventus formula. I'll write about it tomorrow.",

Well it caught up with a vengeance! The last 2 or 3 shaves have gotten progressively worse in regards to the blade pulling. So bad, I thought the residual slickness just POOF, went away magically all of a sudden. After first I thought I wasn't hydrating the lather enough but after the 3rd time, it has to be the blade. I am going to try and run with it the rest of the month but it might get a bit bloody!\n\nThe shave was ok, got some irritation from the blade but overall it's another great day!

I used the same brush (Dogclaration B5 Kashyyyk) and razor (Gillette Fatboy) for the entire month. I changed soaps daily and blades weekly. That was nothing like this. Honestly, I think I'm becoming desensitized to the VoA. I can barely smell it anymore. It's just the way mornings smell. I have become the Valley.\n\nPalm stropped the blade before this morning's shave and it continues to perform admirably. I feel like this could be a Century Club blade, but I'm not sure I want to move it from razor to razor and I'm not sure I can keep using the same razor every day for the next 80 shaves.\n\nAlso, now that we're 2/3 of the way through this ordeal, I would like to send some positive waves toward my good friend u/rmic_. You can do this, buddy. I believe in you and we will make it across the finish line together. This change of heart has nothing to do with the fact that good ninjas are so hard to find. However, to all the Staggers out there, you should just give up now before you completely fry your scent receptors. You're not only hurting yourselves, you're punishing those closest to you. Just stop.",

Did a little test-driving last night, salesman put a little pressure on us but we weren't ready to pull the trigger. Right now we're between the Mazda CX-5 and the Honda CR-V. Most of the metrics are comparable but the Mazda is more fun to drive, and we're torn between having a fun SUV with a little less room in the backseat and one that drives perfectly fine and has a bit more room in the back (future-proofing for a carseat). I wouldn't be surprised if we pull the trigger by Labor Day.\n\nI nearly forgot, here is the [weight Data through Day 20](https://i.imgur.com/d53819Z.jpg) for those of us weighing soaps. The data points at Day 31 show where we were projected from day 10.\n\nLife is short, Stagify yo'self.",

While the Gillette Platinum blades, in my humble opinion, get the job done well enough, they just don't seem to hold up well past the 10th shave or so. Have no fear, I'm not giving up. But I'll be glad when I get rid of these damn things and can give something different a few decent tries since I'm much more sure in my technique. Hell, since palm stropping the blade didn't do much, I wonder what it would do if I hit it on a leather strop tomorrow. Guess I'll find out! Today marks day number 21, so of course I hit myself with 21 sprays of the dark brown good-smellin water. No discernible differences imo from the past several days, so maybe I've hit critical Stagness. No way to find out other than continue to push through because I've still had no real complaints lodged in my direction.",

He first started with some soap and brush I got him (Barrister and Mann with a RR synth). But he never used a DE razor until this month when I loaned him my Rockwell. After a few weeks with it, he's hooked. I've also been letting him use some samples, blades, and aftershaves. Last night he said he wanted to buy one just like mine so I told him he could just keep that one.\n\nWhat a great way to justify getting a new razor as well.. like \"Honey, I have to get a new one, I gave mine to YOUR dad.\" No come back to that one.",

One might call it a \"dupe,\" and it is indeed very, very, very similar. Sure, the note balance might not perfectly match my Creed sample, but Aventus is known to be inconsistent from batch to batch and L'Aventure is reputed to fall within the established range of Aventus batches brewed up over the years. Instead of focusing on these little details I'll point out the differences that anybody with half a nose should be able to spot. First, read [yesterday's assessment of the real stuff if you haven't already](https://old.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/csuth1/tuesday_austere_august_sotd_thread_aug_20_2019/exhic6a/), then proceed:\n\n1. In general, it leans toward the Sweet side of the Aventus spectrum, all the way from top to bottom.\n\n2. The opening is pure citrus - no pineapples, apples, or berries here. Just fruity / floral bergamot and candy-sweet lemon. The combined effect is similar but it's *easy* to smell the difference side by side.\n\n3. The journey from top to heart to base takes about twice as long: the citrus notes are clearly distinguishable for about half an hour and it's a solid 8 hours before the heart yields to the base.\n\nYeah, that's about it. Like I said, they're very, very, very similar.\n\n**So is it good?** If you like the sweet side of Aventus and wish it lasted longer before it hit the somewhat generic (but lovable) macho cologne drydown, you'll probably enjoy L'Aventure. Think of it as an \"Aventus Intense\" flanker, minus the pineapple and apple. Frankly that's not a problem in my opinion, because with the $450 you save by choosing L'Aventure you'll be able to afford a $25 bottle of Demeter Pineapple. That'll give you a stronger and longer-lasting pineapple note than you'll ever get out of a real bottle of Aventus (and you can leave the pineapple out on the days when you're just not feelin' it).\n\nToday I'll wear Explorer by Montblanc, an Aventus-influenced fragrance designed with the benefit of nearly a decade of hindsight. I'll write about it tomorrow.",

I knew I should have spent a bit longer hydrating the lather but made do given the time restraints and still managed to get a great shave.\n\nSame as u/BourbonInExile, I can barely smell VoA out of the tub. I'm up to 5-6 sprays of the EdP, which is my limit since I don't want to annoy my cubicle mates any more than I already do, and I also do not want to completely kill my sense of smell.\n\nI have contacted any third-rate ninjas already in route and they will now be tasked with assisting u/BourbonInExile reach the end of the competition.

Brush worked well but still ate up the lather a bit. Razor + blade combo still felt smooth which is amazing. Definitely can't go ATG but the rest is fine. Mild post shave to wrap it all up.\n\nAlmost done with the soap! Maybe 2-3 days more and it should be gone. That is exciting because Miami Mojito does irritate my skin slightly. Nothing major but I'm still glad to use up the entire soap. I need to think of another soap to use up for AA. Maybe TASS Humidor? or Samples? Decision... decisions.",

This soap really is magical stuff, I always thought it was good but after this month I've appreciated how good it can be. A month of shaving with the exact same setup has meant I can't blame and software for a bad shave, only me.\n\nGave the Santalum Slivers sample another go today, its very similar to another sample I got from Kerosene (Wood Haven). This one is a bit more floral though, I think I prefer Wood Haven, but need to wear each one more to find out.",

I adjusted the angle of my razor and it didn't tug QUITE as bad today. Wasn't the best shave but certainly wasn't the worst. I completely forgot until right now that I'd mentioned stropping the blade beforehand but I'll try to remember tomorrow.\n\nToday was 22 sprays and I seriously still can't tell a difference from 19 sprays. No big deal at work or ANYWHERE and it blows my fucking mind y'all. When I just occasionally wore it, I felt like anyone that walked within 50 yards of me could taste it and now I'm not sure anybody that isn't directly touching me can smell it. It's bananas! Well, it's Stag, but whatever. Still hoping my bottle lasts through the end of my soap and splash. I'll replace it regardless. Pretty sure it'll pop up on the bazaar after this month anyway.\n\nToday's my half day at work and so hopefully I can get outta there by 2 and come home and un-procrastinate in regards to my homework. I've got a paper due today and final due by Sunday. Then next week is the start of two new classes. Yay..",

It's the latest flavor of the month in the \"best Aventus dupe yet\" club, but I ***strongly*** disagree with the Fragranticans who make that assertion because it seems like *everything* is a dupe to them. The average Explorer review is typically along the lines of \"this is the best Aventus dupe on the market except it has no pineapple apple blackcurrant jasmine rose birch ambergris vanilla musk or oakmoss and I'm not sure why they'd leave those out because they seem quite important and I'm not sure why they added vetiver pink pepper sage cocoa and Akigalawood but yes it's definitely somehow the best Aventus dupe and I would know because I wear CDNIM all the time\"\n\nOne of my coworkers has been wearing this stuff almost daily for the past three months. He can't smell a connection to Aventus at all, and never have I ever sat in my cubicle next to his and thought, \"is that Aventus I'm smelling?\" I never understood the hype and the comparison until I wore it myself and I finally detected the passing resemblance for a few moments. At best, it could be a distant flanker, but never a dupe.\n\n[If you need a refresher for Tuesday's review of Aventus, it's here.](https://old.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/csuth1/tuesday_austere_august_sotd_thread_aug_20_2019/exhic6a/)\n\nExplorer opens with fresh, citrusy, juicy bergamot and shades of of sweet, rosy pink pepper. That sweetness lingers and overlaps with the heart for perhaps half an hour. When mixed with Explorer's sharp vetiver, woody patchouli, and subtle leathery nuances, it briefly smells like a less-sweet Aventus heart. The effect doesn't last long... Explorer is unapologetically woody, and the vetiver and patchouli dominate this scent with powerful projection and sillage. They're so sharp that it almost has a mineral edge like Terre d'Hermes. (In fact, if you're smelling this on somebody else rather than wearing it yourself, it's pretty easy to mistake it for TdH if you didn't get to smell the freshly sprayed top notes.) The heart takes a good 6-8 hours to finally soften to a low hum and share the spotlight with the Ambroxan and leather. The final drydown is smooth and warm and a bit reserved, particularly in comparison to the crisp heart.\n\n**So is it good?** It sure is, but it's no more a dupe of Aventus or Terre d'Hermes than Rive Gauche is a dupe of Brut. Do they pay homage to their predecessors? Indeed they do. Are they supposed to smell *the same?* Nope, they're just supposed to smell *good.*\n\nToday I'll wear Silver Black by Azzaro, a chronological predecessor to Aventus that's significantly different note-wise yet strikingly similar in structure. I doubt Creed took any hints directly from Silver Black when they designed Aventus, but they were likely both drawing from the same sources of inspiration as Azzaro did (i.e., modern fruity fragrances and vintage hyper-masculine scents).",

I have never really used this feature, however this morning I was getting a pretty terrible shave on my first pass, and so I thought I would try it out before replacing the blade. It turns out, this is actually a very useful feature. It allowed me to get all of the buildup and scum out of the razor head without actually taking out the blade.\n\nI will have to use this more going forward, because I ended up with a wonderful shave after using it.\n\nAlso, apropos to nothing, my hair looks awesome today. I put it up in a bun for shaving, and when I took it down an hour later its got this great wave going on.",

I told her she can just use it when she needs to smell the smell that makes the smeller smell.\n\n\n\nIt's taking more work to get a good shave on this blade.

We demolished each team to bring home the gold! I was all sweaty after playing 8 games but I smelled amazing (not to mention intimidating)!\n\nJust did a one pass shave today because the blade is choking and coughing, as I try to motivate it forward. It is one stubborn bastard and is not responding well to my words of encouragement. My refill order of Stag soap and AS was supposed to be here yesterday and I fear may be lost at this point. I saw that it left Cincinnati but is still MIA since then. I have enough to get me through the month but will need to ration it to make sure it lasts.\n\nAfter getting home after 1:00 AM and not getting to sleep till 2:00ish AM, I am exhausted am looking forward to a easy, quite day at work. Hope everyone's Thursday is a happy one!\n\nEdit: Spelling (I suck at it).",

It reminds me of summer days as a child, its got that citrus freshness to it initially but then a musty, sweaty, dirty side too after spending all day out in fields or playgrounds.",

The splash will for sure fade before i go out today which is nice for smelling good.\n\nWet shaving has turned me into a slight frag head. I have more EdT's than i thought I'd ever own before. Admiral finally came in yesterday after i ordered it because i miss smelling good like it. I want to experiment with scents so I'm layering Admiral with another top 3 favorite of mine called PRO by an indie house called [OK Fine Fragrances](https://www.okfinefragrances.com/).\n\nBasically, this house takes a single note and ages it in a seasoned oak barrel. For example: \"P\" is patchouli aged in a \"R\"um seasoned \"O\"ak barrel. I was lucky enough to be sent a small sample of each scent so if you happen to check them out and are curious about a scent, let me know.\n\nHappy Friday!",

Well, at least I bought the parts to make the fix, and while I was at it I paid for a new blinker-stick and a new side mirror as it had cracked several years ago. I swapped out the blinker stick quickly and then threw away the old. A regretful move, as this one make clicking noises whenever the wheel is turned, and when you turn the parking lights or lights on under certain, unidentified conditions, you hear a rapid clicking noise near the glove compartment. Interesting...\n\nWell we're probably going to sell it in the coming weeks, and I'd put off the mirror replacement until Tuesday, I decided, I spent money on this, might as well make the appearance a little better. So I had to remove all the pieces, ended up with a lot of broken glass, then I had to scrape the adhesive. After that I had to use an alcohol soaked cotton ball to clean the surface for the new adhesive, and finally place the mirror on it. I used a box cutter for the adhesive scraping, but thought, \"I could be using a DE blade\". While cleaning the surface, I thought \"I have perfectly good Stag that would do the job even better...\". Maybe I should've made a r/wetshaving DIY album, but alas, I missed the opportunity.\n\nLife is short, shave with Stag.",

It's the last Aventus-ish fragrance I'm wearing this week. The note list on this one is pretty long and confusing because of the way they marketed it, so let me condense it:\n\nThings | APHSB | Kinda | Smells | Like\n:--------|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:\n**Early Notes** | APH Spices | Apple | Citruses | Lavender\n**Heart Notes** | Cardamom | Patchouli | Aromatics | Earthy woods\n**Under Tones** | Musk | Ambers | Leather | Moss\n\nIf you compare that to [my previous Aventus breakdown](https://old.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/csuth1/tuesday_austere_august_sotd_thread_aug_20_2019/exhic6a/) you'll notice a lot of common note families and a fairly similar structure, albeit with a few oddities since it *is* a flanker to an old-school aromatic fougère instead of a fruity chypre like Aventus.\n\nIt opens with the signature bitter-smoky-aromatic punch in the nose common to all Azzaro Pour Homme family members, accompanied by some zippy citrus, hints of sweet green apple, and sharp lavender. It's brutally unfocused to my nose, trying to be too many things at once... it would have been better off without the spicy Azzaro opening. Still, the key thing to notice is the green apple and citrus.\n\nIt sorts itself out in short manner and drops the APH stank in about a minute, while the rest of the opening fades over the next ten into the far superior heart as it warms up. They're joined by smoky juniper, earthy patchouli and vetiver, hints of spicy-sweet cardamom, and a handful of minor aromatic notes to once again remind you that *this is an Azzaro Pour Homme Flanker, buddy.*\n\nAll of this sits on top of a suspiciously familiar base of musk, ambers, leather, oakmoss, and sandalwood. As it mingles with the sweet-earthy-smoky-woody heart notes it does a pretty fair impression of Aventus's signature smoky-sweet scent, albeit with spice and no jasmine. The heart eventually fades and exposes the comfortable, retro, manly-but-snuggly base in all its glory after about 4-5 hours, making the pace of the fragrance pretty similar too.\n\nSilver Black has some different sweet highlights, different flavors of smoky woods, and differently balanced base notes, but the overall structure has so much in common with Aventus that it often strikes me as being a [Mirror Universe Aventus...](https://i.imgur.com/KzpaY0d.jpg) almost as though the designer were trying to achieve the same fragrant goals using nothing but ingredients common to late '70s aromatic fougères (green apple aside). The diffusion is even similar: a sweet musky patchouli haze in your personal bubble of fragrance with the spicier woody notes dominating as you get closer to the skin.\n\n**So is it good?** Aside from the trademark \"Azzaro Flanker mess\" at the start, yeah. It's somewhere between classy and seductive. A very nice cool-weather scent to wear with a suit. The opening isn't as polished and streamlined as Aventus, but Silver Black is discontinued, ridiculously cheap, and is Just different enough that nobody will ever ask if you're wearing Aventus. Instead, they'll just enjoy the way you smell.\n\nToday I'll wear Drakkar Noir by Guy Laroche for... reasons. I've never worn these two fragrances back to back like this, but I'm inclined to predict that tomorrow's review is going to be something like \"they smell nothing alike despite sharing a lot of notes.\" I actually expect that Drakkar Noir is going to have more in common with *tomorrow's* fragrance than with the Azzaro... I guess we'll see.",

Today was a real-time, face-lathering shave which included showing the prep and tear-down in the vid. Why not change it up a little, with the hardware being constant this month?\n\nAlso, I kept it a bit speedy and got the 3 pass done in 12 mins, I think.\n\nAs always, I really don't like the way face-lathering often has the lather you build up falling off your face on the first pass.\n\n#### ❧ Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Timeless - Stainless Steel .68 - Open Comb ::: Gillette - Nacet ‹192 uses›)*\n\nDid fine.\n\n#### ❧ Soap Notes\n*^(Chiseled Face - Midnight Stag)*\n\n\n\nThe gasoline/pungent part of the scent seems to be less intense than at first.\n\nBut you wouldn't know it by today's experience with the wife! Here's a story for [Phteven](/u/phteven_j): Right after my shave, I sat down next to her to watch some tv and she immediately said, \"Well, you just shaved.\" Apparently only the edges of the cloud of Stag had reached her nostrils, because in about 5 seconds she started gagging and hacking. She wondered if whoever made this ever got laid. I had to move to the other end of the couch, where she still kept complaining. She asked my little girl to smell me, wondering if it was just her, and the little one said, \"It's Dad.\"\n\nScent Strength: 6/10, nicely present during shaving.\n\nLather: Good one for a face lather.\n\n* 10 second load with very wet soft boar brush\n* a dip or two as needed to build the lather\n* = 4 passes\n\n\n\n#### ❧ Brush Notes\n*^(Zenith - B2 Pro Aluminum 26mm‹24 uses›)*\n\nHasn't really changed much during this month of so many uses. Guess it was pretty broken in when I got it.\n\n----\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Just a little tugging\n*Neck*: Just a little tugging\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Very Close Shave\n*Neck*: Few hairs are showing some tip length (with most being cut flush)\n\n----\n\nDogwood Handcrafts' Midnight Stag Side Challenge is sponsored by the awesome dude behind [dogwoodhandcrafts.com](https://dogwoodhandcrafts.com/)\n\n[Austere August Intro Thread](/r/Wetshaving/comments/chv8g9/austere_august_2019)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm) *and also in the sub's sidebar.*\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

Is it weird that I am excited to keep using Stag even after August? I do not plan on using it everyday after AA but I find the scent so intoxicating so it will come out often. Who's with me?\n\nI am also looking forward to shaving with my Razorock Lupo for the first time. I haven't heard much about it but what I have heard has been very positive. Either way it will be a fun experience with trying something new. Have a great Friday everyone!\n\nEdit: You guessed it...spelling.",

That is surprising to me. My best guesstimate would be that this tub yielded about 25-27 shaves. I used it no more than 22 times and the previous owner said it was used twice. So even if he used it a few more times than that, I still wouldn't have made it to 30. It did look basically full when I got it. All of my shaves with Excelsior were excellent though and my only gripe would be that it got used up so quickly. This blade however has really taken a nose dive the last couple days. I can tell it's really starting to get blunted. Don't know if I'll really try for the Century Club anymore. I can't fathom 83 more shaves with this thing, but we'll see. I'll be ducking out of this AA thread for the rest of the month and posting in the normal one from here on out. Good luck to everyone else and happy Friday!",

Turns out I just don't have the energy or motivation to make it happen. One more week of austerity. I'm already starting to thin about what I'm going to use on September first. I'm waffling between Orbit, which I've never lathered, and Fresca Intensa, which I've only lathered once. Fairly certain I'll go with Orbit. I don't care what the weather's going to be. I want to experience that otter synth menthol.\n\nReally good lather this morning. I started with a slightly dryer brush and then progressively added water while building the lather on my face. Unfortunately, I think I overshaved a bit on my neck. I'm not really used to shaving my face two days in a row and it's easy to overdo it on the second day. That's another thing I'm looking forward to after AA: going back to my regular shave schedule. As much as I love shaving, I also appreciate getting up some mornings and *not* shaving. Shaving every day for 30 days straight gets tiring.\n\nIn other news, I just executed a successful brush swap with a member of the sub and obtained my very first Declaration unicorn ivory broosh. It's a B3 Theodore and I'm looking forward to taking it for a spin once this austerity nightmare ends.",

The Stag remains.\n\n#### ❧ Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Timeless - Stainless Steel .68 - Open Comb ::: Gillette - Nacet ‹193 uses›)*\n\nNo tugging today. Just a great shave.\n\n#### ❧ Soap Notes\n*^(Chiseled Face - Midnight Stag)*\n\n\n\nThe gasoline/pungent part of the scent seems to be less intense than at first.\n\nToday's Stag Story (for [Phteven](/u/phteven_j)): I shaved at lunch, trying to get back to my normal schedule, and also so that I'd have the rest of the work day for the smell to dissipate before I smacked my family in the face with the Stag again. Well, wouldn't you know it, the wife comes in to the office and wants to take the kids out to lunch and a grocery errand with me. Oooof....\n\nWhile she's standing there and we're talking plans, I have to whip out an Aventus dupe cologne to spray in the air so that we she won't die.\n\nThen as we're motoring away, she makes us all roll down our windows so that she doesn't die from Midnight Madness. While she's in the drug store, I roll up the 'dows and turn the AC on, and the kids and I do just fine. My wife is *clearly* the problem.\n\nScent Strength: 6/10, nicely present during shaving.\n\nLather: Love that I'm back to my bowl lathering.\n\nI used the same 7 sec load as yesterday, but ended up with way more lather. I think it's because you're not washing the best stuff down the drain after the first pass like you are with face-lathering.\n\n* 7 second load with lightly-wet soft boar brush\n* 3 tsp water added to build the lather\n* = 4 passes\n\n\n\n#### ❧ Brush Notes\n*^(Zenith - B2 Pro Aluminum 26mm‹25 uses›)*\n\nI may have said in the past that this may be a less than medium backbone brush, but I think it's right in the middle.\n\nAs usual, enjoyable to use.\n\n----\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Few hairs are showing some tip length (with most being cut flush)\n\n----\n\nDogwood Handcrafts' Midnight Stag Side Challenge is sponsored by the awesome dude behind [dogwoodhandcrafts.com](https://dogwoodhandcrafts.com/)\n\n[Austere August Intro Thread](/r/Wetshaving/comments/chv8g9/austere_august_2019)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm) *and also in the sub's sidebar.*\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

The brush felt good now that I can properly hydrate it. Razor + blade felt okay but slightly rougher than the usual. It's got one more use from me and I'm done with it. Mild post shave to wrap it all up.\n\nNow.. Another brush is on its way and it's going to be amazing. I just know it. I still haven't used the \"new\" brush and I have another one on the way... Jeez. All I know is that I'm going to enjoy the month of September. Deals, deals, after deals. I love it!",

I tried stropping the blade on my leather strop and all I got for my troubles was a tiny scratch on my fingertip because of course that's a fuckin terrible idea! Didn't make a difference in the shave either. I blind bought a massive amount of Gillette Platinum blades forever ago from the bazaar and I won't be using these again for next year's AA. Last year was rough and I figured it was a learning curve and technique problems but I'm in the same spot again this year. These blades just don't wanna last this long for me. Oh well. And yeah, 24 sprays today. Jesus it just feels so wasteful, but STILL NO COMPLAINTS. I knew I'd make it the whole damn month without a problem! I just damn knew I would! My poor bottle is lookin mighty slim as is but it's gonna look just sad come Friday. But hey, I can see the light at the end of the tunnel! And ya know what? It's looking pretty wonderful!",

Then the lather was feeling really good and I was just going to do a quick second pass. Then all was well but had a few spots to touch up so buffed those out too. Full DFS status. Splash seems extra cool this morning and I need it.\n\n\n\nToday is the last day of my summer semester, even though I already started part of the fall semester. Kind of a weird limbo. Anyway, next week will be easy. Then back to the grind after the Labor Day holiday.\n\n\n\nKeep up the good fight, Austerians!\n\n\n\n\n[Soap Weight Album](https://imgur.com/a/mdeswux)\n\n\n\n\n[Soap Usage Progress Album](https://imgur.com/a/rtrQlKP)\n\n\n\n\n[Brush Break In Progress Album](https://imgur.com/a/fCfOUq2)",

Well that happened to me as I lathered because the instant I started I recalled a segment of my dream last night. I dreamt that I was face-lathering and it was so terrible and thin and I had the wherewithall to know that I didn't remember how long I loaded and that I needed to load more. Ignoring that advice, my dream-self kept on face-lathering and it seemed to work out well, so I'm guessing he wasn't using Stag, that traitor, just some soap that turns from way-too-thin lather to good lather with more effort. Chiseled Face is similar to Storybook soaps in the way that you load and it instantly gives you that feedback in the form of suds, and after a 15 second load you almost can't get all the suds into your bowl in one motion. So yeah, I dreamt about shaving.\n\nAlso, this blade is starting to tug, and I have a new pimple smack dab in the middle between my lips and nose. Like, you shave it and if you don't make an effort to push it out, you'll skip shaving all those hairs. I did puff it out and that's how I discovered the damn pimple, ouch. I'll be ready to retire this blade after the month.\n\nLife is short, shave with Stag.",

      "body": "**2019-08-24 Austere August SOTD / Magical Perfumery Tour: Sophisticated Shit 5/8**\n\n**Razor:** Fatip Piccolo SE\n\n**Blade:** Gillette Nacet (shave #24)\n\n**Brush:** Yaqi 24mm Moka Express Synthetic\n\n**Lather:** Naked And Smooth by Stirling\n\n**Post:** Unscented Post-Shave Balm by Stirling\n\n**Yesterday's Fragrance:** [Drakkar Noir by Guy Laroche](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Guy-Laroche/Drakkar-Noir-2069.html)\n\n**Thoughts:**\n\nYesterday I wore Drakkar Noir by Guy Laroche, an aromatic fougère from 1982 that embraced lemony soapy evergreeny freshness in a *big way* and marked the beginning of the end for the era of stinky powerhouse colognes. (Cool Water and Eternity, two more wildly successful '80s dihydromyrcenol-heavy \"fresh fougères,\" helped drive the final nails into that coffin at the end of the decade.)\n\nThe reason I'm wearing Drakkar Noir today is to illustrate an interesting point: Silver Black only shares a few notes in common with Aventus, but it follows a similar structure and balance and smells bizarrely similar at times. Meanwhile, Silver Black shares *an awful lot of notes in common with Drakkar Noir...* yet they have a completely different vibe and could never be mistaken for each other. (More than 2/3 of the notes in Silver Black are also in Drakkar Noir.)\n\nDrakkar Noir is one of those ancient fragrances with a note list a mile long. Let's simplify it, as usual.\n\nThings | Drakkar | Noir | Kinda | Smells | Like\n:--------|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:\n**Lighter Notes** | Minty Notes | Green Notes | Citruses | Spike Lavender | Dihydromyrcenol\n**Middle Notes** | Spicy Notes | More Greenery | Juniper | More Lavender | Sandalwood\n**Darker Notes** | Ambers | Patchouli | Leather | Oakmoss | Conifers\n\nWhen compared to [Silver Black](https://old.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/cuaxdz/friday_austere_august_sotd_thread_aug_23_2019/ext2umf/), there's some familiar stuff in there. Lavender, citruses, miscellaneous spicy notes, vetiver (one of the \"grassy\" notes here and \"earthy woods\" in APHSB), juniper, ambers, patchouli, leather, and oakmoss... One could easily be forgiven for looking at the note lists and assuming they're going to smell alike. However, the structure, balance, and blending of the two fragrances are so brutally different that there's really not much in common once the perfume hits the skin. (I can start smelling some hints of DN's drydown in SB after wearing it for about 12 hours, but it's only about 10% DN and the other 90% is still pure Azzaro.)\n\nDrakkar Noir is a love letter to lemon, lavender, leather, and mountains of indescribable mossy coniferous green-ness. Its zesty citrus notes are boosted with a hefty dose of dihydromyrcenol, an aromachemical that does magical things to citrus & flowers and transforms their character from perfume to aftershave. Its camphorous Spike Lavender is blended with minty herbs to make it even more green and cool and even less purple. Grassy green notes are thrown with wild abandon into the upper two thirds of the fragrance, making it even more fresh and herbaceous. Juniper, cedar, pine needle, and balsam fir are similarly spread through the lower two thirds to provide every shade of darker green you could ever need. Tempering all these wildly fresh, bold, energetic ingredients are a sturdy base of oakmoss, patchouli, leather, and amber; together they help smooth out the rough edges and keep things purring along.\n\nIt's very linear compared to something like Aventus with its three distinct phases (fruit > sweet smoky woods > masculine drydown). Drakkar Noir is more of a slow transition from sharp, brilliant, bright green down to deep, velvety, seductive green through the day. Spray it on a jacket and check the smell day after day to see how far into the \"smooth green\" zone it can actually go when left undisturbed... it gets pretty magical.\n\n**So is it good?** Look guys, it's tough for me to be objective with this one, so let me put it this way: if you want to start out smelling like expensive aftershave and finish up smelling like the World's Sexiest Christmas Tree around bedtime, Drakkar Noir is friggin' hard to beat. If that isn't your goal then [I'm not sure what to tell you.](https://tenor.com/view/fire-fly-uh-um-well-idont-know-what-to-say-gif-4132049)\n\nToday I'm going to wear a seemingly unrelated Creed dupe, but there's a historical link between the original Creed fragrance and Drakkar Noir (and they share a few KEY ingredients). It'll make sense eventually.",

We've come out of the final turn and it's a quarter-mile straight shot to the finish line. Tom Hammond's about to hit us with \"and down the stretch they come.\" Time to finish strong.\n\nWhipped up a pretty good lather with the VoA today and got near BBS on my dome. Starting to think I won't be pushing this blade to the century club. Not so much because I don't think it will make it and more because I just don't care that much. Life's too short and blades aren't that expensive. I followed u/CosmoBarber's suggestion and mixed my VoA splash with a couple of pumps of Zingari Man unscented balm prior to application. I have very happy skin right now.\n\nFinally, Un Jardin Sur Le Nil is a fantastic scent. I was beginning to worry that week after week of Ashes was making killing my sense of smell. I've never been to Egypt (the pyramids are on my bucket list), but if it smells half as good as this frag, I can't wait to get there. It smells like a garden full of flowers sweeter, brighter, and bigger than any real life flower has a right to be. I can see why this is one of Will's favorites.",

That's nuts.\n\nLearned: At the third pass, I had more soap with this 5 sec load than I did with a 7 sec load, and maybe even a 10 secong load with a face lathering process. Proves that bowl lathering *can* give you more lather per use than face lathering.\n\n#### ❧ Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Timeless - Stainless Steel .68 - Open Comb ::: Gillette - Nacet ‹194 uses›)*\n\nNo problems. Good shave! Nice result.\n\n#### ❧ Soap Notes\n*^(Chiseled Face - Midnight Stag)*\n\nThe gasoline/pungent part of the scent seems to be less intense than at first.\n\nScent Strength: 5/10, present during shaving.\n\nLather: Love that I'm back to my bowl lathering. This was a really wet lather, so I wouldn't thin this one out any more than this. Worked very well though.\n\n* 5 second load with lightly-wet soft boar brush\n* 2.5 tsp water added to build the lather\n* = 4 passes\n\n/u/youarebreakingthings , the weight before today's shave was 125 g.\n\n\n\n----\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Few hairs are showing some tip length (with most being cut flush)\n\n----\n\nDogwood Handcrafts' Midnight Stag Side Challenge is sponsored by the awesome dude behind [dogwoodhandcrafts.com](https://dogwoodhandcrafts.com/)\n\n[Austere August Intro Thread](/r/Wetshaving/comments/chv8g9/austere_august_2019)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm) *and also in the sub's sidebar.*\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

Hopefully by tomorrow it feels better.\n\nHope you all had less painful shaves today.\n\nHappy Sunday!",

Did a one pass this time around since I touched up again before dinner last night.\n\nLast week of Stag and one more week before I take off to Japan. I need to decide what shaving gear to bring while on the trip. Checked bags both ways so I should be able to bring most things. The challenge will be picking a soap since I have so many that I haven't tried yet. First world problem for sure lol\n\nHappy Sunday!",

Due to the peculiarities of my silly perfume schedule, I will be wearing the real thing today (rather than *before* the dupe). That makes it difficult to write a reflection on L'AK today, so I'll wait until tomorrow to post about both perfumes simultaneously. They're reputed to be quite similar anyway, so it'll likely save some time.\n\nThus begins the final week of Austere August. It has been good for my lathering and shaving technique and has led me to re-evaluate my soap evaluation method, which is good. On the other hand, it has been boring as hell and I'm sick of this blade. I'm anxiously awaiting September 1 so I can throw a fresh blade into this Fatip and experience a super-smooth shave again. Maybe I'll get lucky and all the other unscented-shaving-dudes will fall face-first into a bathtub full of Aqua Velva after they shave tomorrow (thus invalidating their perfect unscented records and leaving the Summer Break Soap sets for me to win) but that seems a little unlikely to happen.",

Not once this month has TTS recommended Valley of Ashes. Today, it wanted me to combine Night Music with Champs de Lavande. I wonder what that would have smelled like. I wonder what smells are. What is my nose for? But hey... 25 days down and less than a week to go.\n\nA little too much water left in the brush made for a sloppy start to my face lathering. Luckily, I was able to empty some of the water without losing any lather by just pressing the base of the knot against my finger. From there on out, the lather was glorious. Maybe not as glorious as SW finally releasing their bath soaps, which I have been patiently waiting for for nearly a year... Not that I'm complaining. The Wolfie is going to get a thorough scrub when this month is over. I don't want to wind up with any serious water spots or soap stains.\n\nThe wife is off to a conference in California this afternoon and, since the company is putting her up at a resort with 3 pools and multiple water slides, she's taking the kids along. It'll just be me, the dogs, the cats, and the Valley of Ashes until next Saturday evening. And, as if this month without smells hasn't been punishment enough, they're going to Star Wars Galaxy's Edge at Disneyland without me.\n\nIf anyone needs me, I'll be over here in the corner crying into my tub of VoA.",

Today was a one pass shave. I have to say, with the amount of soap that I've used, it has made loading the brush a lot simpler. There's about a quarter of an inch gap from the top of the container down to the soap. The sides of the container now provide support to the brush while loading.",

I did feel the lather was a little different but it didn't come out quite right in the end. Maybe I should have mixed for longer, or maybe I just couldn't help but add just a little too much water. It performed well but fell off my face a little too easily for my own preferences.\n\n#### ❧ Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Timeless - Stainless Steel .68 - Open Comb ::: Gillette - Nacet ‹195 uses›)*\n\nGreat as always. Seriously, I don't know that I can tell any difference between this razor right now and back when it was 90 uses old. Of course back then I was using a slightly different razor but that is just crazy.\n\n#### ❧ Soap Notes\n*^(Chiseled Face - Midnight Stag)*\n\n\n\nThe gasoline/pungent part of the scent seems to be less intense than at first.\n\nScent Strength: 5/10, present during shaving.\n\nLather: Love that I'm back to my bowl lathering. Tried to use a bit less water than yesterday, but failed.\n\n* 5 second load with lightly-wet soft boar brush\n* 2.5 tsp water added to build the lather\n* = 4 passes\n\n\n\n#### ❧ Brush Notes\n*^(Zenith - B2 Pro Aluminum 26mm‹27 uses›)*\n\nStill glad I picked this brush for this month!\n\n----\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Few hairs are showing some tip length (with most being cut flush)\n\n----\n\nDogwood Handcrafts' Midnight Stag Side Challenge is sponsored by the awesome dude behind [dogwoodhandcrafts.com](https://dogwoodhandcrafts.com/)\n\n[Austere August Intro Thread](/r/Wetshaving/comments/chv8g9/austere_august_2019)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm) *and also in the sub's sidebar.*\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

I just used a regular DE, I didn't want to look like the nasty bastard that thought it would be a good idea to post a pic of his chewed up pit on W_E. I wish their mods would delete those nasty pics. Anyway, the splash was an interesting sensation. I don't think I've ever had menthol underarms before. Had to stand over the fan and let them air out. I'm going to see what happens with no deodorant and just Stag under there. I may end up smelling like an anime convention.

The sunburn went away enough that I actually enjoyed shaving again.

We'll see how it rolls tomorrow.\n\nHappy Monday!",

The day before I wore [L'Aventure Knight by Al Haramain](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Al-Haramain-Perfumes/L-Aventure-Knight-51824.html) (LAK), a GIT twist with a lot of character. Both fragrances are said to be built around lemon verbena, iris, violet leaf, ambergris, and sandalwood. They are also definitely built around dihydromyrcenol and Ambroxan. How similar or different are they?\n\n1. As with their previous dupe that I reviewed, LAK lasts about twice as long as GIT. I think it's stronger, too.\n\n2. Opposite to the Aventus dupe, LAK seems to have *more* layers of interest from start to finish than the original fragrance. GIT was very, very linear and monolithic on my skin. LAK has a very intense, bracing, almost shocking opening that crawls up your nose and almost clears your sinuses (GIT had almost no opening compared to the punch of LAK). Very crushed-leaf-green and citrus-peely. I think that's from the tea and bergamot they added to their recipe. If you can get past the surface of the scent there's actually a fair bit of complexity to it, including flowery and powdery nuances.\n\nOkay, cool, but what the hell could any of that have to do with the Drakkar Noir I wore before LAK?\n\nDihydromyrcenol and lemon verbena. All three fragraces have a substantial quantity of those two ingredients. The link is most apparent between the Drakkar Noir and L'Aventure Knight, which both share a fizzy, citrusy, lemony quality that lasts for ages. (It wasn't as aggressive in the GIT to me.) Drakkar Noir (1982) and Green Irish Tweed (1985) were both part of a long chain of increasingly \"fresher\" colognes that used larger and larger doses of DHM, eventually reaching its highest concentrations^AFAIK in Davidoff Cool Water (1988) and Calvin Klein Eternity (1990). Together, these four fresh-smelling perfumes changed the direction of the male fragrance market from \"how smelly can I smell like today?\" to \"how fresh and clean can I smell today?\"\n\n**Anyway, are they good?** GIT was pleasant, reserved, and borderline boring to my nose: perfume has progressed a lot over the past 34 years since it was released. LAK once again strikes me as a sort of \"GIT Intense\" flanker because it has a lot of the character of the original with that potent green-citrus opening. You better really love fresh green scents if you're going to wear it.\n\nToday I was going to wear Dior Homme Eau by Christian Dior. I was interesting to compare its powdery sweet iris to that of GIT, but to be honest I can't pick the iris out of the GIT accord as a distinct note. Instead, I'm going to wear Cool Water because I've never compared it to GIT before (only to LAK in the past).",

I get what feels like a good lather and then do my first pass to find that it is not hydrated enough, pass 2 is usually then really smooth and slick. Next shave I add more water and then I can't get a thick lather (perhaps more agitation is in order) on the first pass so I load more soap. The first few weeks were excellent with the lather but for the last few days, I keep having issues.\n\nI know it is technique and also not taking my time. The base is excellent and of course we all love the scent, I just have to get back to the basics and not rush the lathering process. Anywho, off to work, hope everyone has a great Monday!",

First off, I wore through the very center of the puck of Williams and it started sliding around relative to the mug while I was trying to load it.

You may have heard the phrase \"Not my circus, not my monkeys\"; well, this was my circus and they were definitely my monkeys, and they were going bananas. I cannot impress upon you how difficult it was to get them to stop bouncing around while I'm handling what is probably the sharpest object within a mile. It took forever, but at least the aftershave didn't bite me when I was done.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPERFECT HATRED\nFINISHED\n\nKILLS: 84% (26/31)\nITEMS: 100% (5/5)\nSECRET: 100% (1/1)\n\nTIME: 24:30\nPAR: 15:00",

Another quickie before work for me. Shaving before 5am has not grown on me. I don't think any soap would make the task any better. At least Stag pucks a punch so it wakes you up from slumber.\n\nI got my decants of Grey vetiver and Gloria the other day. Can't wait to smell like a beautiful butterfly. I still can't believe some of you enjoy Stag enough to use it outside of AA.\n\nHope everyone has a smooth shave today!",

Last week of Austere shaves. I have smelled like nothing all month.\n\nToday's Day in Grateful Dead History is an awesome 1971 show that I had listened to once before. 1971 is a great year because [Pigpen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_%22Pigpen%22_McKernan) was still at his height and the band was firing on all cylinders. So many good choices from this show, but I love the primal essence of NFA>GDTRFB>NFA. \"No our love will not fade away!\"\n\nHave a great day.",

Slick and Creamy but also easy to rinse off. Brush continued being a lather hog but I still had enough for 2 pass + cleanup. Razor + blade combo still worked well and I'm surprised. The blade is at its 11th use and it still feels smooth without irritation. Mild post shave to wrap it all up.\n\nI got so many things that I want to try out. Couple more Boar brushes, couple more razors, and couple creams and pre-shaves. Next month is going to an exciting month! In the meanwhile, let's continue on the Austerity and enjoy what we have.",

Maybe I've been trying too hard here the pst couple of weeks and that's where a lot of my problems came into play. Not really sure but my face feels fuckin great! I really miss adding the menthol to my shaves every day. That's the FIRST damn thing I'm gonna do on Sunday, regardless which scent I go with. Oh and yes. 27 sprays today. Can't tell any difference other than my torso just felt wet as fuck after dousing myself in the brown stank juice. Mmmmm good times!",

Compared to [Green Irish Tweed and/or L'Aventure Knight](https://old.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/cvl6yz/monday_austere_august_sotd_thread_aug_26_2019/ey53q4m/), Cool Water's opening has mint and lavender bundled with its green-ness instead of citrus, the heart is fairly similar in flavour thanks to all their massive dihydromyrcenol doses, and the base is distinctly different with a classic tobacco / musk / sandalwood / oakmoss / amber / gentlemanly gentleman kind of thing going on. The presence of that base lurking beneath the heart gives it a little more depth to my nose than GIT or LAK, neither of which exhibited much in the way of a distinct base on my skin. They're all definitely *similar*, but if you know what to sniff for they're noticeably different.\n\n**So is it good?** I didn't think so the first time I tried it on a blotter, but it turned out to be much better on skin and a few wearings later I'm sold. I think Cool Water is a pretty decent, mild, laid-back aquatic fragrance, in much the same vein as Green Irish Tweed and its direct descendants. It maybe doesn't have quite the same natural-ish green-ness as GIT does, but who cares? The obsession with natural smells for the sake of smelling natural seems foolish to me when there's an entire world of synthetic possibilities, many of which smell *awesome* despite not smelling like any real-world Thing.\n\nThat's everything on the Sophisticated Shitlist. I'll post a reflection on the lot of them tomorrow. In the mean time, I'm gonna start wearing some Sweet Stuff for the rest of the month, starting with Guerlain L'Homme Ideal Cologne and getting sweeter and sweeter from there. It's gonna get a bit girly over here, folks. Gotta balance out all that MANLY STAG STENCH somehow.",

I don't like derby blades in the V3M. Before I indict them across the board, the shave today was tuggy and just not pleasant. No irritations so I have that going for me. I got two shaves too many using this blade and glad to see it go. It would be at this point I would have pulled out my supply v2 and been better off but since it is AA I solidered on. So far I have used a wilkinson blade 21X, another wilkinson 6 or 7X, and a derby 2X. Looks like I will be using 4 blades for AA. I also felt that SBS left my face tight so I am wondering if the weather changing (less humid) is having a minor effect. In any case, still a good soap. It would be better to use a moisturizer but I choose not to right now.\n\nI wonder if the stag would fix my problems with derby? Don't answer that...",

I wasn't using enough water! I have been a bit on edge in the morning between getting the kids to school and me rushing to get to work on time-ish, so I have been rushing my shaves and the results haven't been the best.\n\nI stopped in on the way to work and got a Bourbon Blueberry Latte. Now normally I am a black coffee kind of guy but I am a sucker for bourbon (scent and flavor). It's not bad but I have never had a latte before and it has an over bearing berry flavor! I would say this lowered my manliness from the Stag but the Stag can not be diluted!\n\nYou! Yes, you....have a great Tuesday!",

Seems like I a lot of work for just one pass, but that's about all I can handle right now with daily shaving. I might look into a shaving stick for future quick shaves. Soap tub is looking light, but I'm not at a ring yet. I must not be loading as much as others, but doesn't seem to need too much soap to get a decent lather going.\n\nDown to counting the days on one hand! Stay strong and happy Tuesday everyone!",

I had to then bowl lather because there was no way i was gonna sandpaper my face.\n\nGood shave overall though. I'm excited for the day i can use my second feather blade on a slicker soap base.",

Just me and the dogs and the little voice in my head that tells me that this is the perfect weather to switch over to my mentholated soaps for a few days. Summer may finally have come to Seattle. It's going to be 82 today and 85 tomorrow. But I live in the Valley of Ashes. No summer for me.\n\nOn a related note, I can really tell that this month has put a dent in the soap and splash.

My youngest started school today. Feeling a little melancholy.\n\n\nToday's Day in Grateful Dead History is THE SHOW I've been waiting for all month. Some say this is the greatest show that The Dead ever played. It was an outdoor festival in 100 degree weather with hundreds of thousands of hippies frolicking in the heat. There are numerous Youtube videos of the performance (filmed by Ken Kesey and the Merry Pranksters) and the whole performance was finally officially released by The Dead . Over the years this performance has been written about and debated as one of the best live performances by a band that played thousands of shows. There may be better, but this one is special. Listen to as much as you can, close your eyes, and imagine the blotter acid just kicking in as you peak on Dark Star (my all time favorite). So many amazing versions, plus the stage banter from The Merry Pranksters and The Dead is often hilarious.\n\n[Here is Birdsong, one of my all time favorites](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xe2u7ogAgtQ)\n\nPlease note that this video has the infamous \"naked man on a pole behind Jerry\" so NSFW!\n\nHave a great day.",

This SOC boar brush has broken in nicely. Bought it used on BST and it was noticeably scratchier than my Zenith. Over time it has softened and I've also come to prefer the ergonomics of the handle (and knot/loft size) to my Zenith. That said, the Zenith still wins for softest bristle of any boar I've tried. I've made my way through the entire WCS splash sampler now (except Graperoot) and I'd rank Chypre as my favorite, followed closely by Cologne. None of them have the menthol kick that I enjoy though, so I've had to chase with Icy Stare to get my fix.",

I did it! I got my first unsolicited compliment from Stag! I went to the Red Cross last night to give platelets but before doing so, gave myself a half-dozen sprays of EDT. I go there often enough that I know most of the employees by name and a few of them are beyond small-talk chit chat. When the phlebotomist took me back to do my history, no sooner than I sat down she asked, \"Is that you I smell? That smells nice!\" No shit, I wasn't expecting nor prepared for that, in fact I think it was the first time talking fragrance to a real person outside the walls of Maggards or my house. Even after I described the scent notes I was expecting a reaction from gasoline, but she didn't even flinch. She swooned at the mention of bergamot and she went into how she likes things like patchouli yet she can't wear too much around the office. Yes, I did bring up YRP and she sounded interested, so I told her I'd bring her one of my sample vials of it next time I came. She then made a couple more comments throughout the donation, so yeah, it was a good day.\n\nToday's shave, aftering seeing how u/sgrdddy is using something like 1 gram of soap every 5 shaves, I tried just swirling the tips of the brush on the soap for 5 seconds. I actually got a more lathery-looking froth on my face from it, but decided it was a bit extreme, so I gave it another half-assed 5 second load and I could tell I'd used less soap. Enough for 2 passes, probably a lousy 3rd pass if I needed it. Still looking forward to swapping the blade, I've got polsilvers next on my blades to try.\n\nLife is short, shave with Stag.",

I'm getting a much better lather that way and this base seems to work best when not thinned out too much. I'm really having to work for a smooth shave at this point though. I can get it pretty good but definitely not the greatest. I hope this dull blade is improving my technique and not helping me develop bad habits. Just a few more days...\n\n\n\nI've been applying some Unscented Skin Salve from Chatillion Lux before bed. I'm really in love with the stuff. It feels amazing on the skin.

It looks like shaving on autopilot is the way to go for me! Another BBS shave with only minor irritation from this blade that's obviously on its last leg.\n\nAs a quick funny aside, my wife is a bit extra tired this morning and stayed in the bed while I finished my routine. The culmination of said routine today was the 28 spray salute. She rolled over and covered her face up and mumbled something about how I was definitely trying to get her outta the bed \"with all my damn spraying\". Now, this didn't seem like commentary about the scent, so I can almost guarantee it's on to 29 tomorrow!",

My whole throat feels awful after smelling this stuff for more than a few minutes. I've given this one enough tries now and I can conclusively say I Don't Like It And I Totally Regret Buying It. I need to figure out how to get rid of some of these popular perfumes that ended up not agreeing with me.\n\nToday I'm wearing cotton candy, more or less. Hopefully it'll be better than the Guerlain.

My summary here will be regarding the feels.\n\n**Retro Bases**\n\n[Aventus](https://old.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/csuth1/tuesday_austere_august_sotd_thread_aug_20_2019/exhic6a/) is decent stuff but it's not for me. I enjoyed the initial fruity opening and the retro masculine amber-leather-moss-musk-patchouli drydown, but I have trouble with the signature woody-hedione-lilial Aventus heart. There's something about it that makes me feel ill after a while, which is sad because I do enjoy the scent. I'd rather briefly smell it on other people than wear it myself, basically... Because of that I couldn't see myself ever being a recreational wearer of Aventus even if it were 1/10th the price.\n\n[L'Aventure,](https://old.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/ctdssj/wednesday_austere_august_sotd_thread_aug_21_2019/exkgtfm/) being a bit like an Aventus Intense flanker, is even more nauseating for me. I'm going to try decanting some 50/50 with Demeter Pineapple so that a single spray is actually only a half spray of each fragrance - maybe that will bring it down to a manageable level so I can enjoy some Aventus-ish perfume without getting ill. Still, a good choice for others who might want a more intense Aventus experience without the pineapple.\n\n[Explorer](https://old.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/ctud22/thursday_austere_august_sotd_thread_aug_22_2019/exoefsg/) is less sweet and floral and more sharp, woody, and mineral than Aventus. That makes it much more wearable (for me) and much less seductive (for the office). My cubicle neighbor wears it almost every day so I don't need to buy it to be able to enjoy it. Don't bother if you can't handle intense, dry, woody patchouli, but maybe check it out if you like that spicy Terre d'Hermes drydown.\n\n[Silver Black](https://old.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/cuaxdz/friday_austere_august_sotd_thread_aug_23_2019/ext2umf/) has that stupid Azzaro mess of an opening, but I prefer its woody fougère interpretation of the same retro drydown. The aromatic-fern-cardamom-juniper heart makes me a lot happier than the woody-floral core of Aventus. Discontinued, cheap, and probably worthy buying if you're an Azzaro dork like me, but it does have its flaws. (I wonder if this stuff smelled better when it was released 14 years ago and it hasn't aged well? The opening is just... total weaksauce.)\n\n**Vaguely Aquatic & Metallic Tops**\n\n[Drakkar Noir](https://old.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/cuqt3l/saturday_austere_august_sotd_thread_aug_24_2019/exyos9v/) is pure magic. I love it. I could wear it every day but I don't coz ***I DON'T WANNA GO NOSE BLIND TO IT*** like all y'all Midnight Stag Maniacs. Like Calvin Klein Eternity and Gillette Cool Wave it features the \"metallic citrus\" dihydromyrcenol-infused aftershavey style of opening that I love, but unlike them I *also enjoy its heart and drydown.* I really don't give a shit about Drakkar Noir's taudry reputation - if anything, that just makes it funnier to me because it's so darn classy to my nose (since my dad always wore it for fancy occasions when I was young).\n\n[Green Irish Tweed, L'Aventure Knight](https://old.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/cvl6yz/monday_austere_august_sotd_thread_aug_26_2019/ey53q4m/), and [Cool Water](https://old.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/cw1ezm/tuesday_austere_august_sotd_thread_aug_27_2019/ey7zxon/) are all pretty similar to each other if you only sniff the heart notes: fresh, green, and \"aquatic.\" The differences mostly lie in the openings, drydowns, and strength.\n\n- Green Irish Tweed is the most mild-mannered, smooth, and linear of the bunch, and I noticed little variation from initial application to heart to drydown. I have heard legends of a \"sandalwood and ambergris\" drydown but have yet to ever notice it on my skin.\n\n- Cool Water has lavender and mint instead of citrus at the start, a fairly similar heart (though perhaps a little less sweet and smooth), and has an unexpected masculine drydown, which is a nice change from GIT which goes nowhere on my skin. Weakest longevity and projection.\n\n- L'Aventure Knight is the most aggressive of the three. It's so fresh and effervescent that it's almost nasty if you over-apply, but it also seems closest to a natural green grassy scent. It's stronger and lasts about twice as long as the other two, but its drydown is just a smoother, milder version of the heart.\n\nBetween the three, I personally find GIT too uninteresting to justify the price tag. I was actually rather disappointed in it, given its legendary reputation. LAK is too strong for my nose and too long-lived to tolerate all day. Cool Water's opening feels a little directionless to me and there seems to be a bit of a dead patch between the short-lived opening and the heart notes kicking into gear, but once the ball is rolling I quite enjoy it. I don't know if I'll keep any of them in the long run, but if I do it'll be Cool Water (and certainly not because of the low, low price).",

WTG, XTG, and another XTG clean up. The soap lathered into a slick and creamy lather. Easy to wash off with good residual slickness. The brush worked up a great lather, enough for the three passes. Razor + blade felt comfortable but I did get couple weepers on the pimples. Mild post shave to wrap it all out.\n\nNot bad, not bad. Austere August is almost closing up and I'm glad to venture onto other variety of gears. I realize that shaving with one setup becomes dry and sooner or later, turns into a chore. Variety gives wet shaving the extra spice that we need. Three days and a wake up until September hits around!",

All jokes aside I do kind of like this, its a slightly floral aquatic which I'm not normally a fan of. This is just light and inoffensive, a fairly easy wearing fragrance. My wife however described it is smelling like Iodine, which I'm not sure I've ever smelt.",

I'm open to suggestions!\n\nI'm shocked that my tub weighed in at 81g, but I suppose there's some logic. I purposely had a stingy load and with a dry brush, so I think in previous days I load with a wet brush and some residual water makes a slight impact on the weight. Without that water weight, this number is probably a truer representation of what I actually have. It was a [very sucky](https://youtu.be/wUE98jNK9iQ) lather though, and I will probably stick to my routine, no matter how much soap gets used. The lather sucked but I honestly zoned out so I don't have much recollection of the shave, but I feel good and see no blood.\n\nLife is short, shave with Stag.",

My brother used the analogy of rubbing some fat or oil between your fingers. If you run hot water over it, the oil gets pushed away. But if you run cold water, the oil stays and gets slippery. I like that and it seems to work for me. Also, the arrector pili muscles attached to the hair follicles will flex when cold causing the hair to stand up. Combine that with a heavier soap load and a nice thick lather, I got a very comfortable and close shave.\n\n\n\nI can count the shaves left on two fingers!\n\n\n\n\n[Soap Weight Album](https://imgur.com/a/mdeswux)\n\n\n\n\n[Soap Usage Progress Album](https://imgur.com/a/rtrQlKP)\n\n\n\n\n[Brush Break In Progress Album](https://imgur.com/a/fCfOUq2)",

When you pull the cap off the bottle you get an instant sweet aroma that's *almost* a perfect cotton candy impression. Freshly applied to my skin it quickly transformed into sugary caramel with hints of red berries and something bright green (apparently fig leaf). Very candy. As the heart warmed up the fruitier notes died down a slightly sharp licorice note joined the sweet caramel. By about 3-4 hours in the top and heart notes were mostly gone, leaving just the base.\n\nThe base! Ah, the base... Along with the ever-present caramel, the base is a warm creamy affair of powdery vanilla musk with tonka and hints of sandalwood. You know what else has a warm creamy base of powdery vanilla musk with tonka and hints of sandalwood? Le Male by Jean Paul Gaultier. I can't promise the same results for anybody else's skin chemistry, but on Me the drydown is a near dead ringer for caramel candies + Le Male (albeit with milder projection that just hovers within arm's length instead of filling the whole damn room).\n\nSo. Assuming your skin is anything like mine: If you want to get to this drydown through a barbershop, wear Le Male. If you want to get to this drydown through a candy-maker's workshop, wear Pink Sugar.\n\nAs for performance, what would the candy / childish equivalent of beastly be? [Angry Unikitty?](https://brickset.com/sets/41775-2/Angry-Unikitty) Two sprays gave me strong projection for a couple hours and a nice personal bubble of fragrance for about... mmm, maybe 10 hours? Skin scent lasted longer than that.\n\n**So is it good?** Yes. I've had mostly negative experiences with candy perfumes in the past - most of them go weird on my skin as soon as they're past the opening notes. This one blew me away by having a delicious opening, a passable heart (not a licorice fan), and a surprisingly nice drydown. Considering that most cheap fragrances generally fall apart after the first ten minutes, I'm pleasantly surprised.\n\nToday I'm wearing Hanae, a \"fruitchouli\" built around toffee, wild strawberry, vanilla, and patchouli. I'll write about it tomorrow.",

I don't understand why it periodically switches me to the wrong editor when I've set it permanently in my preferences.

I have nothing planned for Saturday, Sunday, or Monday and I am THRILLED with that!\n\nShave was good per the norm and I have nothing clever or witty to say. Looking forward to using stuff other than Stag (although I have fell in love with it), but I will miss AA. This was my first r/wetshaving event and I have had a lot of fun with it. Reading through everyone's posts and laughing to myself while the people around me look at me like I am off my meds. Ahhhhh...good times!\n\nHappy Thursday, only 2 shaves left!\n\nEdit: my spell suckey",

I had no idea I would get this far when I started last year.\n\nIn today's video, I talked with a bit of an intro more than usual, since this is a milestone shave. Some is just about marathoning, and some is about my dry-load strategy for this shave. Here are some jump-to points if you're interested...\n\n11:49 Loading the Brush\n13:30 Building lather in bowl\n18:40 Lathering face with too-dry stuff\n19:31 Goes back to puck for more soap\n24:21 Lathering pass 1 of good lather\n35:06 Shave done. Cleaning up.\n37:01 Final comments\n\n#### ❧ Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Timeless - Stainless Steel .68 - Open Comb ::: Gillette - Nacet ‹200 uses›)*\n\nDid just fine today. A little tuggy, because that first pass of lather needed a bit more water, but worked fine. No irritation. Not even any stings during AS application.\n\nAnd no, this blade has shown no signs of stopping. I will stop after my 31 straight AA shaves, and put the Nacet aside while I enjoy other razors. I'll pick it back up later.\n\n#### ❧ Soap Notes\n*^(Chiseled Face - Midnight Stag)*\n\n\n\nThe gasoline/pungent part of the scent seems to be less intense than at first. I'm definitely noticing the leather and wood more lately.\n\nScent Strength: 4/10, lightly present during shaving.\n\nLather: bowl lathering this time with a goal to go so dry at first, as to see if we can get a less airy lather.\n\nIt's not that the existing lathers have been bad. This soap does its job nicely. But I was curious to see if a slower process of adding water would give me something different. It didn't. I mixed for 5 mins, off camera, adding water by 8 drops at a time, and ended up with the same one I always get. And when I put that lather on (the one with 15 sec dry load) it dissipated quickly and I had to shift into the old standard process to get a good lather going.\n\nSo I just learned that slowly adding water with this soap base does not give you a better lather. I assumed it, but wanted to see.\n\n* 15 second load with mostly dry soft boar brush\n* 10 second load with lightly-wet soft boar brush to rescue lather\n* 5 tsp water added to build the lather\n* = 4 passes\n\n123 g is the weight of the soap before today's shave.\nMy usage chart is basically a flat horizontal line. Seems I'm taking about 4-5 shaves to eat up 1 gram of soap.\n\n\n\n----\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Just a little tugging\n*Neck*: Just a little tugging\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Very Close Shave\n*Neck*: Few hairs are showing some tip length (with most being cut flush)\n\n----\n\nDogwood Handcrafts' Midnight Stag Side Challenge is sponsored by the awesome dude behind [dogwoodhandcrafts.com](https://dogwoodhandcrafts.com/)\n\n[Austere August Intro Thread](/r/Wetshaving/comments/chv8g9/austere_august_2019)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm) *and also in the sub's sidebar.*\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

Here's a [bonus timelapse](https://imgur.com/D7kpgzq), sorry it came out sideways. And yes, I had a snack while doing that.\n\nSpeaking of sideways, you may be curious how the left-picture got created. Here's [the answer](https://i.imgur.com/sySWLwJ.mp4). I'll tell you, it felt like it took longer than 45 minutes. Foot fell asleep before I got to the text. There are some obvious issues, but I enjoy the timelapse of this one the most of all that I've done. I'd like to do more but it'd be nice to have some sort of sophisticated setup to get the spacing even.\n\nShave went well, nothing really noteworthy. I'd encourage all of us Stag-turbators to weigh their gear tomorrow. I feel like I still have like, 80% of the EDT left and 70% of the aftershave left, yet I'm probably 50% through the soap. I've always been curious whether people go through their aftershave or soap faster, and this is a good opportunity for a lot of us to see how we compare directly.\n\nLife is short, shave with Stag.",

Just one more to go before I can use a fresh blade again...\n\n2-for-1 review day!\n\nYesterday morning I wore \"Hanae by Hanae Mori\" by Hanae Mori, which is the most repetitively named fragrance I own. It's what is known as a \"fruitchouli\" which typically means mild patchouli wrapped in sweet fruit. HBHMBHM is considered by many to be in the same neighborhood as the Flowerbomb family of scents by Viktor&Rolf, though at the milder end of the spectrum.\n\nTrue to form, HBHMBHM opens with a sweet fruity mix, focusing primarily on the scent of wild strawberry (the little teensy ones that are smaller than a grape). It's accompanied by warm toffee and gentle hints of not-stinky patchouli. The strawberry-toffee mix eventually fades to a quiet base of vanilla, sandalwood, and cedar.\n\nProjection and longevity are oddly weak on my male-but-not-very-manly skin, considering this fragrance is of EdP concentration. The fruity goodness lasts about 2 hours before deserting the base and projection is barely within arm's length.\n\n**So is it good?** It smells really pretty but performance is crummy. Then again, one probably doesn't want to smell like patchouli strawberry candy all day long anyway, and its lack of projection might be considered an *asset* if you are a dude who has to work around closed-minded individuals.\n\n***REVIEW NUMBER TWO:***\n\nI knew ahead of time that HBHMBHM doesn't last past lunch, so I came prepared. I mixed 10 squirts each of l'Aventure and Pineapple into a single travel sprayer and took it to work with me. After lunch I cleaned the weak remains of the HBHMBHM off my skin and applied a single spray of my Pineapple Adventure.\n\nIf you remember my review of l'Aventure, my primary misgivings with it are that it is too strong and that I miss the short-lived pineapple/apple accord from Aventus. The mixture between these two perfumes addressed both those issues: it cut the concentration of the l'Aventure in half, and it added a comparatively massive dose of pineapple to the scent. (Probably too much pineapple, actually; I'm going to add a little more L'Aventure to the bottle this weekend to tweak the balance.)\n\nDemeter's Pineapple isn't the cool, refreshing Apple & Pineapple we expect from Creed. No, it's almost syrupy and over-ripe. Worn on its own, users report about 6 hours of longevity with 2-3 hours of projection before fading down to skin. Mixed with L'Aventure, the Pineapple almost completely overpowered the L'Aventure for several minutes (part of why I think I need to adjust my mixture) and was easily distinguished as a distinct note for about an hour - that's four times longer than it stuck around when I wore the real stuff. Even after that hour, it clearly wasn't gone. It had simply faded in strength enough to balance with the sweet-woody heart, changing the character of its sweetness in a more fruity direction. Awesome.\n\nThe mixed concoction's projection is just strong enough for me to smell hints of it at arm's length while working at my computer, which is exactly what I like: I can enjoy it without being overwhelmed by it, and my wife can barely tell I'm wearing anything from the other end of our double-length desk. The woody, musky, manly patchouli base lasted all the way from lunch to bed time, so clearly the longevity and pacing of the L'Aventure wasn't compromised - just its strength.\n\n**So is it good?** Damn rights, it smells great, and it'll be even better once I tweak the ratio of the two perfumes. Now, to be clear: *Pineapple Adventure does not smell like Aventus.* Honestly, it's even less like the real stuff than the imitation it's based on. It's more of a celebration of Pineapple on a sweet, smoky, woody, musky base (perhaps similar to Stirling's EMP?, which I am unable to sample because Canada). It's sweeter from start to finish, the character and longevity of the pineapple is totally different, and the drydown isn't as leathery as the real stuff.\n\nIn short, it's good stuff, just not Aventus. AND THAT'S TOTALLY OKAY BY ME. In fact, statistics tell us that *most good perfumes are not Aventus.* Almost all of them, really. Remember: my goal wasn't to make a modestly priced dupe smell more like the expensive original. My goal was to solve the specific problems I have with a specific perfume that I own. (Heck, if I owned a full bottle of the real stuff, I'd probably be spiking that one with Pineapple too because I like its sweet fruity opening a lot more than I like its floral-woody heart.) I just wanted something that smells *fantastic to me*, and this goofy shit did the job.\n\nToday I'm wearing Flowerbomb Nectar, another \"fruitchouli\" fragrance featuring gunpowder, vanilla, and syrupy white floral notes (apparently). I'll write about it tomorrow if I survive.",

Even after sweating my ass off and getting stinky, she says i smell good and asks if i have a cologne on.

Shave went well face is definitely BBs. Little bit of irritation on my neck but that willl clears up. Tomorrow I will just make sure to take it easy there. Slowly working in more water has been effective, lather today was almost perfect but I had to add some more water in-between passes. Overall good shave.",

I managed to use the same razor, brush, soap, and aftershave every day of the entire month. That said, I found myself shaving a lot less than I typically do. While travel is part of this, I think another big factor is that shaving got boring. One of the things I really enjoy about it he's choosing the soap, aftershave, and fragrance to fit my mood, and this exercise took away from that ability. I definitely will appreciate my other soups a lot more once September rolls around, and I'm also happy to of learned a lot more about how to shave with this soap and razor.",

WTG, XTG, and another XTG clean up. The soap lathered well. There was a bit too much water but I still had a slick lather to work with. Brush worked well for the two pass + cleanup. Razor + blade felt smooth for the most part. The first pass was a bit rough but still, no irritation at the end. Mild post shave to wrap it all up.\n\nThis will be my last day of Austere August as I will not be shaving tomorrow. It was a fun challenge and I'm glad to be a part of it. I started a bit late and I'm ending a bit early. Oh wells. I got to enjoy the new razor to its fullest. Razorock Lupo is definitely a smooth shaver but it can be aggressive in some spots. Though it's a light razor, a slight pressure will be enough for most of the shaves. Now the brush, Zenith B10 boar brush. That brush is challenging and I'm glad to use it for the entire August. It still eats up a ton of lather but the key is to load with wet brush and load heavy. Like most boars, this suffers with the lather eating syndrome but following the previous rule will help create enough lather for the three passes. I will not be touching this brush as often but it is a good change of pace.\n\nNext month is going to be a fun one. So many products to use, as I have been raving for the entire August. I'll be starting with the Gillette slim adjustable and using the new Semogue brushes. As for the soaps, I'll be rotating between the unseen ones as well as couple Stirling samples and Proraso creams. I'll also be getting couple new soaps for mail call so I'm excited to use those! Also, another brush on its way... Holy moly. I need to slow down as I KNOW I have plenty to work with. Let's enjoy one at a time...",

This was another smooth run. Went with a single pass this time since there was not much stubble after doing 3 passes the day before. I went wild with the edt and did a whole 2 sprays! I think it actually smells better the more you spray it lol. I guess some of the other Stag's were onto something with multiple sprays.\n\nHappy Friday friends!",

They were like, \"are you sure?\" and I was just like, \"yeah, it was really hot\" and then I just left rofl. Not suspicious at all, nope! It would be quite unique and weird if someone's sweat smelled like Stag but maybe they believed. Talk about embarrassing.",

We'll see which one wins.\n\nToday fragrance was a sample impulse buy whilst I was picking up some other samples. Supposedly it's John Wick inspired whatever that means. It's great though I really like it. It's woody and citrusy and floral but not too much of either of them. It's very easy wearing and is just pleasant.

It was great to work with the same soap everyday, as it allowed me to figure out what worked and what didn't. The same goes for the razor and blade. I wish I could have gotten my original blade to last the whole month, but it crapped out halfway through. I'm glad this month is done, though, and I can't wait to start Sandalwood September tomorrow.\n\nEnjoy the weekend!",

I can definitely say that I'm a fan. I'll be setting it aside and pulling it back out in the colder months to see how it smells and what memories it brings back. For now, it might as well be a tub of Shh! for all I know...\n\n\n\n\nI'm pretty stoked that I've made it 31 days on **HALF A BLADE**. The other half is still sitting in the paper ready to go. That's pretty impressive considering I had only made it to 6 or 7 shaves previously. I hope that 31 days with the Magic Razor makes u/needsmorementhol proud since he's the one that turned me on to it. It's absolutely the best razor $1.22 can buy. I had hoped to see more of a blooming of the Stirling boar knot but I guess this one mostly keeps its shape. The tips have gotten soft and are splitting so it's a keeper. (Where my big badgers at tho...)\n\n\n\nEver since the Lather Games I've been picking something to do every day for a month. (Shaving and non shaving) In July it was use a Shavette and braid one head each day. (Missed one shave and failed on the braids) This month, aside from AA, my goal was to do 40 push-ups each day, 20 in the morning and evening. I've met my goals and after this evening's set I'll have done 1240 pushups this month. I've noticed a definite improvement and I'm going to keep it going by bumping up to 50 each day for September. I'm also setting a goal to complete one cosmetology practice exam each day. My shaving related goal will be to use a proper straight razor for the month.\n\n\n\nThe Stag aspect of AA has been a lot of fun. I've really enjoyed the banter and bonding. Huge thank you to u/phteven_j for the challenge. The effort you put into this community is only matched by the quality of your products. I'm forever a fan and consumer your and Courtney's work. (Especially the shirtless brush turning live streams...)\n\n\nSee you all in the regular thread tomorrow!\n\n\n\n[Soap and Brush Movie](https://imgur.com/a/dIHWuP2)\n\n\n\n[Splash and EdP Final Weight](https://imgur.com/a/1qa8aX6)\n\n\n\n[Soap Weight Album](https://imgur.com/a/mdeswux)\n\n\n\n\n[Soap Usage Progress Album](https://imgur.com/a/rtrQlKP)\n\n\n\n\n[Brush Break In Progress Album](https://imgur.com/a/fCfOUq2)",

I had just barely enough soap and AS to do this for the month so thankfully I have no Stag to unload, I can get rid of this brush that I hate and now smells like a gas station permanently, and I can actually use the stuff that I like and remember why I started doing this in the first place!\n\nI can't say it's been a pleasure, but it has been a learning experience. I think I can make a good lather now; while Stag sucks, the soap base is a good one to learn with.\n\nI can go back to smelling yummy, finally! Not that I'll be able to smell myself, I'm pretty sure my olfactory senses are numbed to all but Stag now.",

Lastly, I wanna thank everybody on this sub that showed the vaguest hint of interest in my EdP experiment. If it wasn't for you guys, I'd have given up at day 18 or so. Speaking of the EdP, yes. I sprayed 31 fucking sprays on my bare chest. Here's the funny thing though. Today is a festival here in my little shit-hole of a town and I've bathed in the Stag EdP. The high today is 90 degrees and I'm about to be walking around in crowds of a few thousand people downtown, just stankin the place up! I'm so damn excited!!! Hopefully I can elicit some reactions! I might do a few extra sprays now that I've got a shirt on, just to make sure I project enough. Time for the festivities to begin!",

First i can establish a new routine, I never shaved in the morning or daily until this month. Second, there is always room for improvement in how I do things, I adjusted the direction of my passes and improved my lathering. And lastly, I'm really happy using nacets. Yes I had a few rough patches abut it smoked out, looking at the thread these blades do really last a long time.

Yesterday's shave wasn't bad, but today was awful. I'm proud to be able to say that I finished Austere August it using entirely unscented products in ULTRA NIGHTMARE MODE, but I'm also glad to quit this blade. Sorry, Nacet 31, no century club attempts for you... I'm not that crazy.\n\nThe batteries in my digital scale are dead so I can't be as scientific as y'all Stag-weighers with how much soap I used through the month, but I [CAN post a comparison between a brand new tub of Stirling and my AA month tub of Stirling.](https://imgur.com/a/EWKWHUx)\n\nThis month was good for my lathering and shaving technique, I think. I finally put in the effort to really nail down face-lathering, so I got that going for me. I tried different sorts of passes to learn to compensate for a less-than-perfect blade. I got slightly more efficient overall and learned to save some time.\n\nOn the other hand, having zero scent to lure me over to my shaving shelf tested my resolve in an odd way. It wasn't so much \"I would rather be using a different soap today,\" but rather \"I'm not sure I feel like shaving since it's so boring like this.\" I sure hope /u/rocketk455 is merciful with us poor unscented saps who foolishly chose to take his challenge.\n\nYesterday I wore a couple Flowerbomb flankers by Viktor&Rolf. Both had the \"candied patchouli\" scent that I enjoy straight out of the vial, but they were pretty obnoxious on my skin. I didn't like either of them and they both gave me a headache. They were quickly scrubbed off so I'm afraid I can't tell y'all what they're like.\n\n**So were they good?** No, they were gross.\n\n*****\n\nInspired by my success with Pineapple Adventure earlier this week, I'm wearing Hanae mixed with Pink Sugar today, just to see what happens... I enjoy the opening and heart of Hanae and the drydown of Pink Sugar, so maybe they'll fill in each others' gaps and produce something amazing. They're pretty similar in a lot of ways, so I anticipate they should compliment each other pretty well.",

End OF AA. Woot!**\n\nAA is over. Whew! OK shave today. I have to say that summer break soap unscented is really good stuff. No irritations from the soap itself and it just is a good choice. I recommend it w/o reservation. I had kept track of how much I used but I only tracked it from Aug 10-31. I weighed the tub before/after and did a little math. So in 21days, I used 20 grams of soap by spooning it into a bowl. This works out to be about 1 gram per day and 28 grams works out to be an ounce. Given the soap has 4 ounces of product once could expect this soap to last at least 4 months. I would go even further in that you can scoop less and stretch the soap out to last 6 months. With that said, as of last check SBS dude was running a sale on unscented shave soaps at $8/tub. You could just use two tubs and last one year I suppose. The key part being scooping out into a separate bowl for every shave. To me this is pretty austere and would be more reflective of being a saver personality and also someone that is completely practical in shave setup. Given what this forum is about I doubt anybody here would consider this a likley option. I could do it but even though I prefer unscented items, I tend to change up brands so its really hard to be that married to a shave soap. On the upside, I am not sick of \"the stag\" yet. The biggest disappointment was not being able to use a single blade the whole time. Also, mixing a derby blade in there was a bad idea. Once I starting get ingrowns then I need to use sharp enough blades. I have my limits.",

My AA got a lot easier when I stepped down from Ultra Nightmare Mode to Normal Mode, so I could use a new blade and switch razors. After a circuit of all of my commonly used razors, I've come down the the following preferences:\n\n1. Rockwell 6S\n2. Fatip Piccolo\n3. Mühle R41\n4. Karve CB\n\nI'm kind of surprised to see Karve at the bottom, but there we are. I've been using the E plate, and I'm thinking of revisiting the B plate. But, my Rockwell 6S is just so stinking good. It's a perfect balance of efficiency and extreme smoothness. Also, the Fatip is my newest, and I've been very impressed with it (especially at the price point).",

Last shave of AA!\n\nI would first like to thank my sponsors:\n\n[u/Siliski_Soaps](https://www.reddit.com/user/Siliski_Soaps/) For making their Unscented [Soap](https://www.siliskisoaps.com/). Wonderful soap, has definitely earned a permanent place in my den. May do an AAR in a week or two after reacquainting myself with some of my other favorite soaps. [See](https://imgur.com/a/BiEpoGj) you in a couple of weeks, you've earned your R&R.\n\nMaggard's for their wonderful little [22 mm Tuxedo](https://www.maggardrazors.com/product/maggard-razors-22mm-black-white-synthetic-shaving-brush-black-handle/) and for being an all-around great place to shop. I love you [Little buddy!](https://imgur.com/a/MkGcPMn)\n\n[u/chiseledface](https://www.reddit.com/user/chiseledface/) I'm still not sure if the creation of [Cryogen](https://chiseledface.com/) was an act of genius or madness but God bless you. At the beginning of AA the level of Aftershave was at the [top of the label.](https://imgur.com/a/PKhxiGD)\n\n[Ralf Aust](https://www.maggardrazors.com/product-tag/ralf-aust/) Wonderful straights, I own 2. [6/8 Spanish point, African Blackwood scales](https://imgur.com/a/OUywe3g)\n\nI would also like to thank u/rocketk455 of [Summer Break Soaps](https://summerbreaksoaps.com/) for his sponsorship of the Unscented Challenge. Good luck to my fellow UC competitors.\n\nTo the other members who competed in AA I offer a tip of the cap to you. Those of you who used a single scent this month get my respect. I'm pretty sure a whole month of using anything other than unscented would have ruined that scent for me.\n\nLast but not least I would like to thank the fans. Without you none of this would have been possible!\n\nOTD in\n\n1888 The body of Jack the Ripper's first victim, Mary Ann Nichols, is found in Whitechapel , in London's East End. To bad Sherlock Holmes isn't real then we'd know who the real Jack the Ripper is. Great stories if you haven't read them.\n\n1946 Foghorn Leghorn, Warner Bros. cartoon character created by Robert McKimson and Warren Foster, (Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies series), first debuts in \"Walky Talky Hawky\" One of my favorite characters. Was going to say from childhood but then realized my grown ass still likes Looney Tunes. Th-th-th-th-thats all folks!\n\nOff to do hurricane prep at my sisters. Stay safe my fellow Floridians!",

As promised, the Wolfie is getting a bath with some scrubbing bubbles right now to get the soap scum off. I can't imagine actually living in (or rather going back to) a world where I just use the same soap day after day after day. Sure, you get good at whipping up a lather. But after a while you just stop smelling it, which is a damn shame with a scent like VoA (maybe it's OK for Stag).\n\nIt's supposed to be rainy and 76 tomorrow; sunny and a high of 75 on Monday. Not exactly \"heap on the synthetic menthol\" weather. But I'm anxious to actually use my tub of Orbit. I've also got some Zingari samples I need to get into before all the on-sale stock disappears.\n\nI suppose it's time for u/phteven_j to flip his coin. Good luck, u/rmic_! It's been an honor \"competing\" with you. We'll always have the Valley of Ashes.",

I'll be continuing the use of this one for the upcoming shaves.\n\nThe razor is fun to use as its like twice my age. It's a little too mild for me and I like more weight in a razor but theres just something about it I really like. I'll not be using this much in the near future because a have a Karve that's still sitting in the box waiting to be used.\n\nThe blades are my daily drivers but I'll never EVER take one past 5 shaves again...... EVER.....\n\nStirling is such a great soap, the perfect balance of performance and price. I also find it ironic that out of all the soap makers, these guys make the most scents and I used their unscented puck.\n\nAftershave really shined for me. The cooling strength is perfect with a good 30+ minute of cooling goodness. As I said, it can turn a rough shave into a good one.\n\nNo guys, you cannot talk me into playing your monthly games anymore!",

Congrats to everyone that also made it, especially all of those that have successfully completed their 31 day trial period and have now become fully initiated members of the Cult of Stag and have accepted Grand Stag Master u/Phteven_j as their leader. You will each be doused with 60 sprays of Stag prior to receiving your phandles, no exceptions, unless you wish for more at which point you can have up to 75. Don't be greedy, save some for the rest of your Stagmates. All non-Stag software must now be purged in massive den PIF's. u/youarebreakingthings will be making the rounds to draw and tattoo the soap label on each of you in the coming days and u/CosmoBarber will be giving each of you a celebratory shave with the soap of your choosing, which by now is Stag of course. Your automatic monthly Stag boxes containing the soap, splash, EdT, body soap and candles will begin shipping shortly. Always read the terms and conditions of the contest rules.\n\n31 shaves with nothing but VoA wasn't easy. I'm glad I made it the entire month with the same setup but I'm ready to get back to variety. I have my eyes set on trying to join the Century Club so I'll keep going with the Nacet or the Perma-Sharp I set aside prior to AA. At least now I can switch out my razor whenever I want.\n\nI learned that I'm a weirdo for scooping soap in a spiral pattern. Rest easy, this is the only soap in my den that gets scooped in this manner, all else gets lathered directly from the tub just like rest of you normal folks. The only downside I encountered, apart from missing my other brushes and software, was that I became nose blind to the scent the longer I continued to use it. I purposely limited myself to 5-6 pumps of the EdP so I didn't completely kill my sense of smell or annoy those around me.\n\nI want to give a giant shoutout to u/BourbonInExile who gave this competition more meaning and kept it interesting with the third-rate ninjas who failed miserably at knocking me out of the competition. May he save some funds and upgrade to second-rate ninjas for next year. He had a change of heart in the last half and kept this man in motion to make it until the end.\n\nHe unknowingly entered my secret PIF for a set of his choice, was [deemed worthy by the karma bot](https://imgur.com/a/pZzd58n) and he also choose the exact same number as the[random number generator](https://imgur.com/a/Jis5S9s). What are the odds of that happening, I certainly don't know, it's magic y'all.\n\nNo joke, u/BourbonInExile, this is a real offer regardless of which one of us wins that sweet phandle. It's been a real blast to have someone to share an entire month of Ashes with and the back and forth banter kept it fun. PM me your details and the set of your choice...perhaps a Stag set? It doesn't have to be something currently available if you don't know (sorry, no unobtanium, I spent way too much on third-rate ninjas myself. Unless you want some unobtanium from my \"To Sell Eventually\" box) something upcoming is cool too. I keep my promises sir, after all I would not want those third-rate ninjas to come after me again. Best of luck with the coin toss, we'll leave it all to fate!\n\n[VoA Before and After](https://imgur.com/a/jnokDyZ)\n\n[VoA Soap Usage Album](https://imgur.com/a/yNe79P2)\n\n[VoA Soap Weight Album](https://imgur.com/a/GE4HsK2)",

Here are the last two: [Mirror Stag Gif](https://imgur.com/a/2nrdvpk) and [Blind Stag Gif](https://i.imgur.com/xpH5nJS.mp4) Unfortunately I did not finish my super-secret project but I'm not counting it out just yet, things got busy this month and it definitely took a back seat.\n\nAnd WTF is going on with Reddit? It's 10AM and I'm convinced that u/phteven employed those third-rate ninja's used by u/BourboninExile and u/rmic_. I see by the several posts by kcam9908, shredsofmetal, and Zaboomifu, and I picture they are mashing the post key to prove that they finished the various contests while Reddit tells them to try again later. I figure I am not alone. If I were competing for a prize, I too, would be desperately posting my SOTD so that it got seen.\n\nNow it's 3:30 and it looks like everything is good with the world. I agree wholeheartedly with what u/Cosmobarber said: I think this whole Stag event brought many of us closer, I felt there was significant camaraderie among many of us, and with so many of us participating and in a non-competitive environment, it was fun knowing we could cheer for and push each other to the end without a conflict of interest.\n\nI'll shave with Stag one more time tomorrow, and do a sort of epilogue. Do some final weight trends, compile all the drawings, etc. After that, I'll seal the Stag away until next August and participate in the newfound tradition.\n\nLife is short, shave with Stag.",

The shave went great. I was surprised it took me so long to try the soap. I'm recently new to double edge shaving and have found it loads of fun trying out different shave products.\n\nIn the past, I disliked shaving and would usually use the same canned stuff. Shaving was relatively boring and a chore that I would put off as much as I could. I thought the cartridges where too pricey and didn't know much about other alternatives. Today, I enjoy shaving very much and dislike missing a day. Shave soaps like this keep me enjoying the hobby and looking forward to my next shave.\n\nThis particular soap had an exceptional lather and great slickness!",

So it's time to post some thoughts for the month. (Though, since I started late, my true end of the 31 days of Stag will be Sept 4.)\n\nAnother fine shave. Other than family derision, scorn, and pleas of mercy, this equipment and software has treated me well all month. Thanks to [Stephen](/u/phteven_j) at Dogwood Handcrafts for the Midnight Stag challenge.\n\nMy little girl came in while I was shaving and said that it smelled great, but then later, after I had applied the splash, she (and her brother) was gagging and being all dramatic. I guess the AS just has some notes/strength that she doesn't like.\n\nSome things I learned this month:\n\n* Bowl more efficient ... Given a certain amount of soap, I had shaves this month that showed that a bowl gave you nicer quality lather for more passes than that same amount of soap mixed up in a face lather. I'm not trying to convert anyone. Just an interesting point. If you want to stretch your soaps farther, then bowl lathering can help you do that. And your 3rd pass won't be scant and merely workable, but just as rich as your first one.\n* Learned that the first pass sometimes needs to be wetter than the the subsequent ones. A few times I mixed my lather to suit what I needed for the first pass, and was left with it being a bit too wet for the 2nd and 3rd pass. Maybe if I did some kind of face wash before hand it would not be the case, but I'll just add a few drops of water to my first pass brush and be fine with that.\n* I learned that it may take me 2 years to use up this tub. At 1 gram used every 4-5 days, I may still be able to use this very tub to inflict great grief upon whoever shares my room at the nursing home.\n\nThings that were particularly enjoyable this month:\n\n* Reading the accounts of you guys using the Stag EDT!\n* Reading how Conk was treating /u/zaboomifu a lot nicer than some would think around here.\n* Watching our Williams participant /u/kaesees be able to learn to dial it in and bask in its snot-like slickness.\n* Seeing some of you take a blade further than you ever have, and discover that you lived, and sometimes liked the new kinds of shaves you got from it. :-)\n\nIt was a good month, and I'll be seeing you on the normal SOTD boards for the 4 make-up days of Stag that I'll post there.\n\n#### ❧ Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Timeless - Stainless Steel .68 - Open Comb ::: Gillette - Nacet ‹201 uses›)*\n\nVery good as usual.\n\n#### ❧ Soap Notes\n*^(Chiseled Face - Midnight Stag)*\n\n\n\nThe gasoline/pungent part of the scent seems to be less intense than at first. I'm definitely noticing the leather and wood more lately.\n\nScent Strength: 4/10, lightly present during shaving.\n\nLather: bowl lathering this time with a goal to use my normal method and amounts on the current soft water at this location. Normally at home, my water is hard.\n\nNot really all that much difference.\n\n* 7 second load with lightly-wet soft boar brush\n* 2 tsp water added to build the lather\n* = 4 passes\n\n\n\n#### ❧ Brush Notes\n*^(Zenith - B2 Pro Aluminum 26mm‹33 uses›)*\n\nSince this is the last day, I'll repeat what I have said about this brush. I really enjoyed it every day. Medium backbone. Great soft tips. Not scritchy at all. Good massage feel. Easy splay.\n\n----\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Just a little tugging\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Few hairs are showing some tip length (with most being cut flush)\n\n----\n\nDogwood Handcrafts' Midnight Stag Side Challenge is sponsored by the awesome dude behind [dogwoodhandcrafts.com](https://dogwoodhandcrafts.com/)\n\n[Austere August Intro Thread](/r/Wetshaving/comments/chv8g9/austere_august_2019)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm) *and also in the sub's sidebar.*\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

After a mont of stag thanks to /u/phteven_j I'm still loving The Stag. I tried to see how long I could stretch one blade at the beginning of the month but after 3 days my face wasn't having it, the blade was tugging and I ended up with lots of small cuts and had to change the blade out for my 4th shave.\n\nShaving every day is something also something that im looking forward to taking a break from, between this and Lather Games I'm half debating No Shave November.",
