The lather was among the best, with cushion and glide for days. The incense like scent isn't something I'd normally go with (not sure why I chose that one, might have been all Maggard's had left) but it's a very pleasant, calming and warm scent.\n\n\nSeriously such a great soap base, I can see why people were saying it was one of the best new soaps last year.",

A new year and I'll be doing something very similar to what I did last year - sample slaying. A good friend sent me an abundant supply of samples to add to the couple that I still had left over from 2016. I'll be using one of my full size soaps now and then, but basically I'll be using samples for the next couple of months.\n\nFirst up, Seville. It's hard for me to believe, but I have never tired Seville. I guess I must have found it to be redundant with respect to the other barbershop scents that I have, but that's not quite accurate. It stands alone within the genre. Since it's B&M White Label, lather quality isn't an issue. Using a really nice pig just seemed right.\n\nAnother go with Uncle Joe and his boys. This razor has the possibility of becoming my favorite straight. It just has a really nice face feel. I only have four shave ready straights, so it's not hard to find a favorite.

I'm starting off the new year with a series of den tours. [A little background on the plan if you're curious.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5l8x7d/saturday_sotd_thread_dec_31_2016/dbtzc0e/) First up is a walk through the razors. For the razor tour I wanted a soap that performs really well, and was versatile scent wise. It was down to the Vetivertal and L & L Grooming Marshlands, but I ended up choosing the Wholly Kaw. The greener slightly milder vetiver scent felt like I could take it more directions fragrance wise, and performance for me is a real toss up between the two. Both are fantastic.\n\nThe only razor I'm skipping is my old Norelco electric. I used it as infrequently as possible, and it was never comfortable, leaving razor bumps like nobody's business. The battery won't hold enough charge for a full shave, and the blades are long dead.\n\nSo, first up to bat then is the semi-disposable BIC Hybrid 3 Comfort I picked up when I had to shave and the Norelco was dead. It didn't do much for the razor bumps and added a nice layer of razor burn. A couple of months of this was what finally lead me to wet shaving.\n\nComing back with some experience and technique, I got a just-passable, comfortable shave. Nothing pleasurable about it though. The blades were tuggy, and the clogging was annoying as hell. Also, I can now recognize where the pressure comes from. The blade is tuggy, and since the pivot head is \"helping\" you with the angle, pressure is your only recourse to try to get a closer shave. I left some minor stubble rather than upping the pressure. I think before when I was using this setup, I was really digging in with the razor in order to get a close one pass shave. No wonder it was razor burn city.\n\nIn the end, if it was all I had, I think I could dial it in for acceptable shaves, but I have absolutely no desire to do so.\n\nComing up in the next shave, the Merkur 23C.\n\n\n\n## 🎆 🎇 Happy New Year Everyone! 🎆 🎇\n\n\n\n**Razors**\n\n[Merkur 23C >>](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5lkdvs/monday_sotd_thread_jan_02_2017/dbwgzzk/)\n****\n\n**Tours**\n\n[Razor Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5lefc9/happy_new_year_sotd_thread_jan_01_2017/dbv6f4p/)\n\n[Brush Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5o322q/sunday_sotd_thread_jan_15_2017/dcgf5ud/)\n\n[Soap Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5q99m5/thursday_sotd_thread_jan_26_2017/dcxird1/)",

I got in the shower and it hit me - I'm turning 40 this year (in a few months). I needed something classic. I already knew I was going to use my Super Adjustable, but that was because I love it. After my realization though, it dawned on me that it would be 40 as well. Then it was clear what soap it would be. Now granted it's not a vintage soap, but it's from that era. Maybe sometime this year I can get a vintage brush and reknot it. Then I would have as classic of a shave as I can get.\n\nHave a happy 2017 everyone!",

Then I made he mistake of browsing the SOTD thread beforehand, changing my mind every two seconds. Thanks guys.\n\nWound up calling an audible and changed everything, mostly based on staring at the shelves and finally catching a peek of Leviathan hiding in the back. An excellent choice as always.\n\nI'm going to try to curtail my soap acquisition a bit this year and get to some stuff that I own but haven't even used yet; there's way too much of that, samples and tubs alike. I'm going to TRY to use a soap only once until I've been through everything (or at least everything that is worth using, I do have a few that have been relegated to breaking in boars) so I'll see how that goes. As far as acquiring other stuff, always need more post products (scents last longer than on the soaps for starters) and more vintage razors.\n",

Actually it was my wife that spotted it. It's my favorite injector. I frequently (okay, always) give /u/NeedsMoreMenthol a hard time when I use it because he's Canadian and has had a difficult time finding one ever since I found mine and I won't shut the fuck up about it. So in keeping with that tradition, this is the best damn injector ever made and it's mine. ;-p\n\nAnother go with Seville. Another great shave. This sample should last most of the week. This huge (to me) brush just makes a stupid amount of lather. I think I'll use another big brush tomorrow.\n\nLast day off work.

I was not happy with cartridge shaving, less for monetary reasons than shave quality reasons. I shaved as infrequently as possible and had tons of irritation and ingrowns that would swell and leave sore spots all under my jawline. My electric razor caused the same issue.\n\nI don't know where or what I saw in the past that had planted the seed for safety razors, but at some point I decided to give one a try rather than replace my old electric. Some minimal google searching and reading of amazon reviews lead me to this razor, along with a brush, cream and blade sample pack.\n\nThe 23C is a very mild razor. I think this was giving me trouble in learning technique when I first started. I tended to shave it way too steep, with too much pressure (something it took me a while to understand, and only in retrospect). The ingrowns stopped immediately, but I was still dealing with regular irritation. Trying to solve that eventually lead me here.\n\nComing back now, I can really experience the mildness. I dialed the angle in pretty easily though, and the shave today beats the pants off the disposable cartridge shave from yesterday. That being said, this razor just doesn't seem that efficient. Three passes got me a reasonably close shave, maybe 25% BBS areas and the rest in the DFS ballpark, and I think I would need to get too aggressive with the razor to try to force it. One of the things it took a litte while to learn in the last few months was not to chase BBS. Take your reductions and move on. If you get BBS, great if not, let it go and try again tomorrow.\n\nFinal verdict on this razor. I wouldn't recommend it, and outside of little events like this I'm not going to be reaching for it much. Between the inefficient head geometry, and the overly long, hollow, light handle, it's just not enjoyable or comfortable to use.\n\n\n\nHave a good one!\n\n\n\n\n**Razors**\n\n[<< BIC Hybrid 3 Comfort](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5lefc9/happy_new_year_sotd_thread_jan_01_2017/dbv6f4p/)\n\n[Maggard Razors V3 >>](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5lqzpn/tuesday_sotd_thread_jan_03_2017/dbxy8tr/)\n****\n\n**Tours**\n\n[Razor Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5lefc9/happy_new_year_sotd_thread_jan_01_2017/dbv6f4p/)\n\n[Brush Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5o322q/sunday_sotd_thread_jan_15_2017/dcgf5ud/)\n\n[Soap Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5q99m5/thursday_sotd_thread_jan_26_2017/dcxird1/)",

I couldn't be happier about the progress I've made in my goal to learn how to shave with a straight razor. I'm getting really good shaves and I am not nearly as nervous as I was a week ago.

The Stirling tester is really nice. Soft tips with lots of backbone from the loft. It's not terribly dense, but the low loft kinda makes up for it. I like it a lot more than the bulb I had.",

I am blown away by my initial impressions. I've had trouble with my neck since I started wetshaving (and before that point when I used carts). The contouring is weird and the hair lies very flat. This creates little pockets of hair that most razors I've tried barely touch except on an ATG pass where they get snagged and ripped out. I also tend to get a few ingrowns in these areas which trying to shave over severely irritates, perpetuating them.\n\nThis is the first time I have had no apparent irritation and such a close shave on my neck simultaneously. Cheeks are BBS, neck is DFS. I am thrilled.\n\nI think I'm finally done mucking around with the formula on this shave soap. v5.3 is really good in my *totally unbiased* opinion. I think I'm also happy with this version of lavender. It's a french lavender, very lightly mentholated, and rounded out with cedar, balsam fir, armoise mugwort, patchouli, and a twist of Sicilian lemon.\n\nI'm not sure that Armada Blossom is a good match for it, but it smells damn good anyway. My only complaint is that I consistently forget to shake it and pour the separated oil drops out.",

I love my boars and never got on with any badgers but it's love at first sight. The Hone is a heavy beast to throw about, I have the weight dialed in but the head I am still getting used to. All in all a great shave to start the year with.\n\nBelated Happy New Year\n\n\n[sotd](https://i.redd.it/lj4jssvzkc7y.jpg)",

Only the second time using this soap. No complaints about it, but I'm not sure it really does anything better than other soaps I use. Rinsing with cold water at the end really brought out the lime scents in the soap.",

Don't think I have ever had a bad one with a Valobra soap. This 88 just won't die. There has been about a half a Maggards sample size left for ages now and it keeps going. Sure going through a full puck went surprisingly fast but man I just want to finish it already. Thankfully I have a new rose aftershave coming from /u/hawns so it will see a bit more use in the next week. Also Sherlock and Unconditional Surrender go really well with each other.",

After reading sidebars and watching all the recommendations others were getting, I decided to place on order with Maggard Razors. Armed with the knowledge that I didn't like the long light handle on the 23C, I picked up the V3 with the MR5 handle, the polar opposite handle, along with a synthetic brush.\n\nThe first shave I had with the V3 was enlightening. I could feel the blade more, and tell what was happening, and with all the advice I'd read while figuring out what to order, I managaged a close comfortable shave using WTG and XTG passes. It was the first DE shave where I came away irritation free, and it was fantastic. Somewhere around two weeks later, after continual use of the V3, and starting to include ATG passes, I hit my first BBS shave, completely irritation free. It was a mind blowing experience. I was already really enjoying wet shaving, but that shave cemented my love for it. I sat around all morning feeling my face in disbelief. There was only one small patch close to my adam's apple where I could feel any stubble, regardless of which direction I rubbed my skin.\n\nToday's shave went extremely well. Three pass BBS with no effort. There's a good reason this razor gets so many recommendations for beginners. It just works, it's easy, and very affordable. Is it my favorite razor. No, I've found others I prefer for various small reasons, but this is the first one in the tour that I would be perfectly fine using as my only razor.\n\n\n\nHave a good one!\n\n\n\n\n**Razors**\n\n[<< Merkur 23C](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5lkdvs/monday_sotd_thread_jan_02_2017/dbwgzzk/)\n\n[1961 Gillette 195 Adjustable \"Fatboy\", Mild Setting >>](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5m5edt/thursday_sotd_thread_jan_05_2017/dc131wj/)\n****\n\n**Tours**\n\n[Razor Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5lefc9/happy_new_year_sotd_thread_jan_01_2017/dbv6f4p/)\n\n[Brush Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5o322q/sunday_sotd_thread_jan_15_2017/dcgf5ud/)\n\n[Soap Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5q99m5/thursday_sotd_thread_jan_26_2017/dcxird1/)",

I believe I have found the perfect blade for this razor (at least for me). Great shave today. Unfortunately for me, 2017 is starting off rough. My gramps cancer is back and worse than last time. Everyone is hoping that he'll pull through again, he's a strong man. Have a great shave everyone.",

Was going to say 1st half of the year but with other soaps I also want to finish and other soaps in my den that's not realistic.\n\nWhat a great shave to start the year. Used my favorite razor and had no issues.\n\nI am officially on day 3 of Whole30, last night was tough because we went to a burger place for my mom's birthday. Was able to get the burger but no bun. Coffee, which I usually drink with all of the cream and all of the sugar, I thought was going to be the biggest challenge isn't so bad. Had cold brew for the first time this morning and kind of like it. This will also motivate me to finally purchase the rest of the proper devices to grind/make my own coffee.\n\nHappy New Year everyone!",

The tips are better on the M&F, but the Romera has way more backbone...and it doesn't really have that much. Can't get over how floppy the M&F Finest is. Definitely surprising, although the tips really are nice. Just different from what I'm used to, I guess.",

Looking back through my SOTD posts, my first shave of 2016 was also with a Chiseled Face soap (*Trade Winds*). Works for me. 2016 started poorly and got progressively worse as time wore on, culminating in probably the worst x-mas I can remember.\n\n2017 has been much better so far. I got to spend a good weekend with my kiddo, we tried champagne (i.e. sparkling grape juice) with our New Year's dinner (he thought it was yucky), the weather has been about as good as one can hope for in WNY in January. I took today off to stretch the long weekend a bit because I was alone at work all week last week, and I'm getting ready to start rearranging my apartment (I'm pretty boring).\n\n*Ghost Town Barber* + *La Forêt de Liguest* is one of my favorite scent combinations, and is perfect for rainy days (such as today). I think I'm going to spend January and February killing samples (starting with the remnants of this *Ghost Town Barber* sample) while I figure out what I want to do for my March Madness thing this year. If anyone has any suggestions about themes they'd like to see, please let me know.\n\nToday's soundtrack is both a plea and an excellent hip-hop record that I hadn't spun in way too damn long. Let's hope it's not just wishful thinking. We'll see how the year progresses.\n\nI hope everyone had a great holiday this/last year. Enjoy your shaves, all!",

      "body": "Prep: Hot shower\n\nLather: Saponificio Varesino Dolomiti\n\nBrush: Simpson Chubby 3 Manchurian\n\nRazor(s): LASSCo BBS-1, Wolfman SS Turn't Up (.74?) OC on Ti WRH2, Feather Artist Club SS (folding)\n\nBlade(s): Brand new Wizamet Iridium Super Extra Stainless x 2, Kai Captain Mild (?)\n\nPost: Saponificio Varesino 70th Anniversary\n\nBeing the start of the new year, it's time to remove my facial hair growth I start for Movember, or No Shave November, whichever you choose to call it. This year I went full on beard, with cleaning up cheeks and neck daily. I thought it would be fun to do a challenge of sorts to see which razor would remove this much hair with the least resistance, so I brought in my two favorite (DE) big guns to battle. I thought a fair way to compare would be to use one razor on one side, and another on the other side. Technically this was last night's shave, but if I have time later on in the day, I'll have another shave.\n\nSide one was with the Wolfman.\nThe first few strokes went fine, but quickly began to clog. After a switching sides and a few short strokes, the razor would be clogged again, and I would have to remove the hair manually before doing another stroke. I continued this until most of the hair on one side was removed. There were a few obvious patches, but decided I would leave them for the next pass.\n\nOn to the other side.\nThis side I brought the BBS-1 into the arena. Half a stroke in it was completely clogged and wouldn't cut, but rather glided over the beard as if there was no blade in it at all. I removed the hair clogging it and attempted another stroke with the same results. After a few cycles of this, I decided I needed to bring in the player I should have brought in for the job in the first place, the Feather Artist Club SS. It's been sitting here with a Kai Captain Mild in it for I have no idea how long now, but I know it only had one or two shaves on the blade, and was cleaned well with both water and alcohol before storing, so I didn't worry about putting a new blade in. What a HUGE difference, the hair peeled off in a somewhat large patch before the blade was a little clogged, which was something I didn't expect. I had no idea this type of razor could clog a bit. As it turns out, the hair gets stuck parallel to the blade in the crevice between the blade and holding edge. It's a small crevice, but just enough to allow hair to sit in there and not allow it to cut properly. However, even in it's most 'clogged' state, it still peeled the hair much better than either of the DE's I brought in to battle.\n\nIn the past, when removing this much hair, I've typically just used clippers to bring it down to what looks like 4 or 5 days growth, then just used a DE. I think last year I may have just used the AC, then a DE, but I don't really remember. I had a pretty good idea the AC was the right one to bring in straight away, but you know, it's fun to experiment. I didn't have any time constraints, so why not?! =)\n\nAfter getting much better results on the side I used the AC on, I decided to just clean up patchy mess\nThe Wolfman left with the AC. I then rinsed, had a look to make sure everything seemed somewhat even, the proceeded to lather up for the first real comparison.\n\nI decided I would use the BBS-1 on the side I used the Wolfman on. This is when it became crystal clear why I love this razor, it glided over the patchy stubble that hadn't seen a razor blade in months, like nothing...so smooth, as if I just shaved yesterday, and there was no break. I've typically developed some degree of sensitivity when going so long without shaving a particular area, but not this time. I'm guessing it is just the perfect combination of excellent lather, blade, razor, and most of all technique, but this pass was just so damn smooth, I was in complete disbelief, as in I thought I was off on my angle. I had to look closely to see if I botched the pass...Not the case, all the patchiness was brought down to a level acceptable from a two pass daily shave, but this was thenfirst *real* pass. HELL YEAH!!\n\nOn to the other side, where I brought in the Wofman. Although it was a different feel, it was just as smooth! Right on over the patches, reducing what was left from the AC down to almost nothing, again, as if I never had the few month ~~neglected~~ growth at all!!\n\nAfter a rinse and lather, I went for a final pass with the Wolfman. I figured with the potential unevenness, and potential for irritation, it would be best to leave it at the initial removal, and two solid passes, hopefully minimizing the chance of irritation, which is standard for me when removing some intentional growth. This pass again went smooth as silk, no muss no fuss EXCELLENT shave!!! No real irritation, there were 3 hairs that grew parallel to my skin, just below the skin, and didn't want to come fully out from under the skin. Rather than risk ruining the rest of it, I decided I would handle those with tweezers first another day, then remove them next shave...maybe today, maybe tonight, maybe tomorrow =P\n\nThis was an EXCELLENT shave, and I had fun experimenting with a few of my favorite razors...It just doesn't get any better than this for me!!!\n\nAnyhow, I hope everyone's NYE celebrations went well and everyone is all safe and settling into the new year =)\n\nHave an awesome day, everyone!!!",

The soap base is good, with nice post shave and is pretty slick, but I find that it thins pretty quickly, which results in less protection. I do go a bit slower with a straight, but not slow enough that lather dissipates with any of my other artisans.\n\nEdit: Also really bummed about my M&F brush... apparently I was one of the lucky ones who's handle was shipped in October to the UK and it is stuck with whatever courier they used. They don't think they can get it back and Brad is remaking those handles and resending them. So, my delivery date was supposed to be now or slightly before Christmas, but won't be until the end of April... Nothing anyone can do about it and I guess I'll just be waiting a bit more.",

Once lathered, the patchouli became more prominent and gave way to the rose. Also, if someone receives an unlabeled soap and purchased one with a label, you might have gotten mine. I ordered one with no label and got one with so there's that.",

Taking whiffs from the tub/bottles since I received it and I'll think I recognize a scent only to never smell it again.\n\nAlso my first time using the ER. I kept forgetting how to hold it and would let it drift away from my face, holding it more like a de, so there's a few small spots of razor burn. I can't complain though, it mowed through the stubble on my head with no problems.\n\nI've been favoring the Stirling 26 over the 24 since I bought it but picked up the smaller brush on a whim today. I'm not a brush guy but it feels like there's less backbone to it which was a nice contrast. I'll need to use it more often.\n\nHave a great day!",

This thing is HEAVY and seems well constructed. I caught a black handle one for a great deal over on one of the Facebook groups so I couldn't resist trying it out. I like the way the blade loads and the adjustment mechanism is easy and smooth. I wish they clicked into place, but I suppose this way it's infinitely variable which is nice. I started on a 1 because I'm a pansy and I didn't have much growth going on. The shave was smooth and uneventful. I did dial it up to a 3 just for S&Gs and it felt a lot more aggressive than I was anticipating so I dropped it back to a 1 to finish out. Can't complain, it's a really neat razor. I think I'll hang on to it for a while and give it a run with a few different blades. Nothing interesting to report about the soap or the brush, they both performed as-expected. Have a great whatever today is everyone!",

The lather was a little too wet but I forced it to work after such an awesome BBS shave with this set up yesterday today was a let down. Grabbed the barristers reserve to free me from my sins of this shave along with the CL I'm off the hook! Really like the Ladas blades working well for me in the standard. Really wanting to pick up a tech or NEW and an injector. Gotta look at something to keep from buying soap right??",

I got this sample from /u/urfrendlipiro and I finally got around to using it. Here's a mini review from a n00b FWIW -\n\nThe scent off the sample is fantastic - very strong on the Orange, and the cedarwood / pepper is very muted. This is the kind of soap I would take a bath with (in fact my favorite shower gel is Bath & body works Orange Ginger). The scent leaves me feeling fresh, clean & awake!\n\nThe performance is great as well - adequate globs of slick lather, however not as slick as my B&M glissant and L&L Bison soaps. Where B&M/L&L leaves me feeling well hydrated even after the shave, Mike's left me a little more on the dry side. I think I just may be spoiled in this regard though.\n\nAnd, my CL Delor de Treget splash sample went so well with this soap today. I'm glad to have a full salve bottle on the way soon!\n\nHave a nice day!!!",

I don't want my others stained, even if it doesn't last forever. I really tried to grab the Cade Rich, but Lavanille called me.\n\nI honed this razor the other day and the bevel just wouldn't meet without tape. Went at it again last night and got a really awesome edge on it. Was popping hairs like buttah. Really comfortable shave and left me silky smooth with no irritation.\n\nI may have been getting complacent with safety razors, but I know my skin just does better with a stiffer blade. Is true for AC blades and GEM blades. Not like there is much blade chatter with the razors I have, but the thinner DE blades just seem to give me micro cuts and a less comfortable shave. Guess that's why we always close with the phrase YMMV!",

W_E is a great source for beginner information and for browsing around from time to time, not unlike a big open street bazaar. On the other hand, WS is more like a great cocktail party, a mostly civilized affair of familiar faces and good conversations, with a little debauchery thrown in the mix toward the end of the night.\n\nAs I started following the SOTD threads, I started contemplating other razors by watching what other people were using, and got the bug for a vintage adjustable. I dug through the bazaar and the first thing I found was a cheaper Fatboy. Not in the best cosmetic appearance, but functionally ok, clicky dial, doors work fine, no bent gaurds. Gave it the scrubbing bubbles toothbrush scrub to clean up what I could, but the plating on the handle is worn a little thin.\n\nShaving from a dialed down position, the Fatboy is extremely forgiving of error, but highly demanding of proper blade angle to get a good shave. While it's smooth, it makes it tough to get completely clean in some areas, particularly in the flats around my adam's apple. At this setting it's not too dissimilar from the Merkur 23C, but just a tad more comfortable. Not knowing anything else, 2 was the first setting I tried. Not bad, but not as good as the shaves I was getting from the Maggard V3. For the bulk of the usage I've had with the Fatboy, I used settings 4 and 5. However my next razor was already on the way, and showed up the day after I got the fatboy, so it never got a long exclusive run.\n\nWhile I like the fatboy, this mild setting is too mild for my tastes, especially for taking down multiple days growth. Today's shave was extremely comfortable. Thinking about it, a vintage adjustable set on 2 would make a great beginner razor. Dial your technique with extreme comfort, then open it up to find your sweet spot. The comfort comes at a bit of a cost however. While the comfort was high today, the results were more in the minimally acceptable range, mostly DFS after three passes, but not nearly as close as I get using other razors with the same ease. Tomorrow, I'll dial it up to 9 for a different shave with the same razor.\n\n\n\nHave a good one!\n\n\n\n**Razors**\n\n[<< Maggard Razors V3](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5lqzpn/tuesday_sotd_thread_jan_03_2017/dbxy8tr/)\n\n[1961 Gillette 195 Adjustable \"Fatboy\", Aggressive Setting >>](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5mjnpx/saturday_sotd_thread_jan_07_2017/dc4c92t/)\n****\n\n**Tours**\n\n[Razor Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5lefc9/happy_new_year_sotd_thread_jan_01_2017/dbv6f4p/)\n\n[Brush Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5o322q/sunday_sotd_thread_jan_15_2017/dcgf5ud/)\n\n[Soap Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5q99m5/thursday_sotd_thread_jan_26_2017/dcxird1/)",

But after reading some comments here, I've decided to do an experiment. I'm at 12 shaves with this current GSB blade and it's showing no signs of letting up. The 5 and 6 shaves weren't the best, but since then the blade has been like butter. I'm going to see how long I can push it.",

This stuff is fantastic, and the scent on this one is my favorite yet. Really pronounced tobacco scent that lingers nicely. Wanted to look nice for my wife's best friend's wedding today, so took my time with my xtg passes, did some bullfrogging on my neck and it really helped me get a BBS. Only area I wasn't happy with was my ATG pass on my head. Decided to be frugal and squeeze the excess lather from the brush onto my head, and I've found that only gives me a rougher result than biting the bullet and applying a little more soap. The after feel of this soap is so amazing, by far my favorite. Rarely do I ever feel compelled to apply an after shave balm because it just hydrates so nicely. Might have to on my head though, already feeling a bit irritated up there :(",

My past 3 or 4 shaves have been with very cold water and literally for everything - the face wash, the soaking of my brush, the post shave rinse, etc. and wow I have to say this gives me such more soothing post-feel/less irritation compared to when I shave with hot water.\n\nIdk what it is but I'm going to continue with this cold water style of shaving and if it keeps being so damn great, it'll be the only way I shave from now on.\n\nQuick question though, is there any potential damage I'm doing to my badger by soaking it in really cold water or no?

It's awesome, a bit more aggressive than the Grip but it works wonders.\n\nGot my order in from Stirling yesterday (will post contents on Monday in Mail-Call thread) just had to try out the brush this morning. It's already a winner. I normally bowl lather, but tried out face-lathering with the fan knot. Had two loose hairs that cam out when I lathered it last night on my puck of Van der Hagen that I keep for just such occasions.\n\nHave a fantastic Friday!",

The face sauce was basically the same composition as aftershave, so it was a bit odd for me to use preshave, but did deliver a nice, moderate amount of menthol throughout the shave. It was wonderful as a post. The lavender is the dominant note up front, but in the dry down, it mingles nicely with the vetiver and clary sage. Very nice stuff.",

These last 2 weeks have been the longest 4 day work weeks. I received the Cuero Oscuro yesterday, and like all Wholly Kaw tallow soaps I've used, performance is excellent. I'm a big fan of the scent (getting mostly leather and vetiver). The new labels are classy and a welcome addition to the collection. Only complaint is I could use a little more intensity in the scent strength. This is the first Wholly Kaw toner I've used, and it's really an amazing after care product.",

They have the friendliest staff, and they were great about answering all of our questions, even giving us a tour of the shop at one point. It was really cool to learn a little bit more about how bigger vendors produce soap in bulk quantities, and my dad loved being able to have his beard-related questions answered.\n\nAll that being said, I wasn't that impressed with the soap. It sounds like WSP recently changed up how they scent their soaps, and the new batches were barely distinguishable between the different scents. In the end, I picked up their Starbucks soap (which is being discontinued, but can still be ordered if you call them) because I am still chasing after good coffee scents, but it ended up irritating my face just like other coffee soaps have in the past. Oh well, I guess. I just really hope they find the right balance when it comes to scenting their soaps. We have a number of shave companies that haven given AZ a bad name; it'd be nice to have one that we can be really proud of.",

To be honest, when I first ordered AMD, I didn't realize it was based on a women's perfume; not necessarily because I didn't know it was based on Tom Ford's Black Orchid, but because I didn't know Black Orchid was a women's perfume (because I am very unobservant). It's smells good, but not knowing what it was, it wasn't what I was expecting.\n\nCatalan's Prairie on the other hand, while very floral, doesn't smell as much like a perfume compared to AMD.\n\nSo far, 4 shaves, and 4 samples conquered.

We did get a healthy dose of freezing rain which always makes it fun driving since idiots down here still insist on going out and not slowing down. The parking lot at work has some nice patches of ice too which will make it fun to walk to the car.\n\nFirst Snow made up for the lack of real snow so I can't complain. I went outside after shaving and damn, that menthol was chilly but exhilarating! The Rockwell blade went from great the previous shave to feeling like I was waxing my face and ripping the hair out.\n\nStay warm.",

I think this was getting me shaves that were similar in feel and comfort to the Maggard V3 razor, but slightly more efficiently. At that point my thinking was still impacted by the irritation I had fought through during my first days of wet shaving, and I thought that aggressive razors (or settings) were the last thing I needed. I hadn't yet come to the realization that over compensating for poor technique with the mild razor was what was causing my issues, I was barely figuring out how to control angle and pressure properly.\n\nSince then, I have ventured out into more aggressive razors and settings, finding them to be much more to my liking, and now setting 9 is right where I want to use the fatboy. The shave today was much better than the previous shave on the 2 setting. Opening the gap gives much more control over how the blade meets the skin, angle and pressure wise. There is more blade feel to fine tune controlling the pressure rather than just riding the cap to prevent too much digging in. For me this leads to a BBS result with no irritation in a very easy fashion. Three pass BBS over 2 days growth, with only one small spot that required a touch to clean up. All while being nice and comfortable.\n\n\n\nHave a good one!\n\n\n\n**Razors**\n\n[<< 1961 Gillette 195 Adjustable \"Fatboy\", Mild Setting](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5m5edt/thursday_sotd_thread_jan_05_2017/dc131wj/)\n\n[1962 Gillette Slim Adjustable, Mild Setting >>](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5mq1do/sunday_sotd_thread_jan_08_2017/dc5mdom/)\n****\n\n**Tours**\n\n[Razor Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5lefc9/happy_new_year_sotd_thread_jan_01_2017/dbv6f4p/)\n\n[Brush Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5o322q/sunday_sotd_thread_jan_15_2017/dcgf5ud/)\n\n[Soap Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5q99m5/thursday_sotd_thread_jan_26_2017/dcxird1/)",

And, I really like the smell. Though I find myself wishing it were stronger, coz the smell is so good!\n\nI'm going to spend a few days later doing a direct comparison with some other Vetivers, but this is definitely high on my list of great Vetiver scents. One of my other favorites is Marshlands. I can see how it's called Dark Vetiver. To my untrained nose, It has a certain darkness about it that's hard to describe. Definitely darker than Marshlands. Not as dark as Hallows, though Hallows is stronger on the cocoa and not just a Vetiver scent.\n\nThe WK Toner is great - leaves me clean / not greasy feeling and hydrated. Not as hydrated as liniment or CL salve though. Come to think of it, a Dark Vetiver balm might have been a good idea too. I've never tried the WK balms - will add it to the list.\n\nAlso got to try a slant for the first time. Damn this thing is SMOOTH! How the hell does this thing shave so well with such a big blade gap? Okay the right angle is very tight which is a little annoying. But when you get the angle right, this thing is efficient AF!",

      "body": "###[Razor-Tour: 1962 Gillette Slim Adjustable, Mild Setting](http://imgur.com/a/oqIJp)\n****\n\n* **Prep**: Stirling Soap Co. - *Ben Franklin*\n* **Razor**: Gillette/Delta Echo - 1962 *Slim Adjustable* (2)\n* **Blade**: Gillette - *7 O'Clock Super Platinum*\n* **Brush**: Paladin Shaving - *Jade Lotus 26mm*\n* **Lather**: Wholly Kaw - *Vetivertal*\n* **Splash**: Thayers - *Original Witch Hazel with Aloe Vera*\n* **Balm**: Eucerin - *Original Healing Rich Creme*\n* **Frag**: Chatillon Lux - *Bon Vivant*\n\n****\n\n\n\nWith my interest piqued in vintage adjustables, I watched the bazaar for a Fatboy or slim for a couple of weeks, along with browsing through the offerings over at Delta Echo razors. Finally, a cheap Fatboy showed up and I pulled the trigger. Within about 20 minutes of that, /u/fitzman49 put up a custom Delta Echo Slim for a very good price, so I didn't hesitate, and did what needed doing. This was the primary reason the Fatboy never got a long run. I went back and forth between these two for a bit, but eventually settled on the Slim as my preferred razor of the two, and it became my daily driver for quite a while.\n\nThe shaves between the two are highly similar. Obviously from an aesthetics point of view, a Delta Echo restore looks much better than a tarnished, plate-worn razor, but I also felt like the shaves with the Slim were slightly better as well. Maybe it was the worn plating on the Fatboy, or some property of the coating Delta Echo uses, but the Slim seems to glide better on the face to me. It is also slightly more comfortable to hold. In terms of general feel though, the head geometries are so similar, that I can't discern much if any difference between the way the blade feels on the face while shaving.\n\nJust like with the Fatboy, the Slim is just not great for me when it is dialed down this far. When I was using it regularly, I pretty much used it on setting 4 when shaving daily, or 6 for a first pass when skipping days between. I never turned it up past 6 during this period. Considering this, the Slim did just fine today. Not my best shave ever, but more than acceptable, and better than the dialed down Fatboy by quite a bit. Of course it had the advantage of not trying to mow down multiple days of growth on such a low setting.\n\nFinal verdict on the Slim is that it is a very good razor. If you're a newer wet shaver, looking to move beyond your start up gear, either a Gillette Slim or Gillette Fatboy would be a fantastic choice. They provide very comfortable shaves, and allow you to explore what your preferences for blade gap might be. Try it down low like this on a 1 or 2, but don't be afraid to dial it all the way up too. I avoided this for a long time for fear of harsh, uncomfortable shaves. For me however, it turns out that the more aggressive the setting, the better it performs. This is something that took me far too long to figure out, from the unnecessary fear of aggressive razors.\n\n\n\nHave a good one!\n\n\n\n**Razors**\n\n[<< 1961 Gillette 195 Adjustable \"Fatboy\", Aggressive Setting](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5mjnpx/saturday_sotd_thread_jan_07_2017/dc4c92t/)\n\n[1962 Gillette Slim Adjustable, Aggressive Setting >>](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5mwp4p/monday_sotd_thread_jan_09_2017/dc709rx/)\n****\n\n**Tours**\n\n[Razor Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5lefc9/happy_new_year_sotd_thread_jan_01_2017/dbv6f4p/)\n\n[Brush Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5o322q/sunday_sotd_thread_jan_15_2017/dcgf5ud/)\n\n[Soap Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5q99m5/thursday_sotd_thread_jan_26_2017/dcxird1/)",

Ironically I was reading a thread about Stirling soap over on B&B and there was a couple of people who disparaged the soap as mediocre and hard to lather. I had no problem getting enough lather for five+ lathers with a brand new brush with only two test lathers on it. Every soap has its own personality and requires getting to know how to lather it.\n\nSpeaking of a brand new brush, I set this knot Friday night and took it out for its first use this morning. What has been said about it seems pretty accurate. /u/Huckleberryking described it perfectly. It has very soft tips and surprising backbone. It has backbone that would make a couple of my boars jealous. Too soon to tell how the knot with turn out. It will require more uses to relax fully, but my first impression is pretty good. I agonized over what knot to buy for months. I settled on this one and I'm glad I did. I think it's going to turn out to be a pretty,good brush.",

This will be my first go with Caties bubbles I'm pretty excited, how similar if at all is their French formula soap to their current luxury blend of soap?\n\n**Update**\nThe CB was amazing, such a wonderful soap makes me wonder why it took so long to acquire a tub of it. Oh ya a lot of my soaps are amazing what a problem to have.",

It cost me more for the honing then I paid for the razor. It had a little bit of a smile in it, I took it to a local shave shop (Kent of Inglewood) in the city, these guys are fantastic it was originally a 6/8 razor now it's 11/16. This was my first straight razor, never used one before either I only did my cheeks as I was too chicken to do a full shave with it and finished off with my safety razor.\n\nHave a great Sunday everyone!!!",

I had been mutilating my face with various cartridge razors from Gillette since the onset of the third millennium until a co-worker made me look into wet shaving as an economical alternative. However, I have a feeling that I'll end up spending *much* more on shaving now that I've discovered the rich world of brushes, razors, and soaps, but I have no regrets! If my skin turns out to get healthier and less irritated, then all the better.\n\nSo this shave took me about an hour since I'm a complete n00b and had to take things slow, but I wasn't in a hurry anyway and simply enjoyed spending some quality time with myself, face to face as it were.\n\nI had some trouble getting a good lather to begin with, I think I might have used too little shaving cream and too much water, and ended up discarding my initial batch because it just didn't feel right when I applied it. The next batch, however, turned out just fine, but I was a lot more careful with the water this time, so that's probably why.\n\nBy the way, I really enjoyed the way the brush felt against my skin! I know that brushes have an exfoliating effect, maybe that's what I felt, or maybe it's just a pleasing sensation to begin with. In any case, I am already looking forward to doing it again tomorrow.\n\nThe actual application of razor to skin went much better than I had hoped. I had expected to bleed a little, but didn't need my styptic pen after all--this time, I'm sure I'll nick myself eventually. I had five days worth of beard, so I ended up doing three passes, two WTG and one XTG. I'd like to think the result was at least a SAS, and I hope to be able to repeat the performance tomorrow morning before I go to work.\n\nOverall, I'm very happy that I decided to look into wet shaving. As for my wallet's feelings on the matter...I guess time will tell. (Right now, international shipping fees is the only reason I haven't ordered a bunch of stuff from Maggard Razors and Stirling Soap Company, but I suspect that won't stop me for long.)\n\nThanks for reading!",

First Snow hasn't gotten any love since Christmas due to my new acquisitions I got then, so it was time to revisit.\n\nFirst Snow is legit and I need to use it more often.\n\nI also hadn't used my Slim in a long time either so I went with that and a Voskhod. I told myself before my shave that I wasn't going to adjust the setting during the shave and stuck with it at 5. The shave was super smooth and I was reminded why it's part of my arsenal. Next shave will definitely be dialed up a notch to maybe 6 or 7, but the Slim is just a darn good razor.\n\nAlso got to thinking after my shave of what other vintage Gillette's are similar to the Slims individual settings in regards to aggressiveness. Just off the top of my head, my long comb NEW is similar to my Slim on setting 6 or 7, while my Sheraton is similar to the Slim on setting 9.",

I think I covered my history and experiences with it over the last few shaves when discussing it along with its older brother the Fatboy. Today was mostly just about giving it a turn on its highest setting.\n\nAs anticipated, the aggressive setting on the Slim easily outperforms the milder setting for me. Whereas yesterday's shave was mostly in the DFS category, today's shave was mostly BBS. Though the blade gap was higher, and the razor was more efficient at removing my stubble, it didn't feel any less comfortable to me to use. I've since found other razors that I prefer for usage, but I would be quite happy if this was the only razor I owned. It performs very well, and is built to last.\n\n\n\nHave a good one!\n\n\n\n**Razors**\n\n[<< 1962 Gillette Slim Adjustable, Mild Setting](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5mq1do/sunday_sotd_thread_jan_08_2017/dc5mdom/)\n\n[1954 Gillette Flare Tip Super Speed >>](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5n41cx/tuesday_sotd_thread_jan_10_2017/dc8mm0w/)\n****\n\n**Tours**\n\n[Razor Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5lefc9/happy_new_year_sotd_thread_jan_01_2017/dbv6f4p/)\n\n[Brush Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5o322q/sunday_sotd_thread_jan_15_2017/dcgf5ud/)\n\n[Soap Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5q99m5/thursday_sotd_thread_jan_26_2017/dcxird1/)",

Have a head cold and feel like absolute shit so while I'm feeling like crap I'm just going to finish of this tub. I figure 2 or 3 more shaves. Definitely looking forward to this coming back around. Especially the Tonique. Smells so good and is incredibly versatile.\n\nOn to football. The Giants really shit the bed last night. Could have won but definitely should have been a closer game. Oh well. They are a couple pieces away on offense from being a much better team. Eli probably has a few decent years left so I'm hoping they can get some O-Line help and a Tight End in the off-season. Now I'll be rooting for the Packers and Patriots. Packers since i hate the Cowboys and I actually kind of like New England. It's cool to watch a dynasty. And as a football fan it's fascinating to watch Billy B work.",

Had a blast--got to see family, got to see friends, got to party, got to relax. Packing for all these climates was a logistical nightmare but I managed to do it in a carry on. As much as I enjoyed it, it's nice to be home and not living out of a suitcase anymore (despite coming home to 6+ inches of snow). And it's DEFINITELY nice to no longer have to shave with a dulled Gillette Guard...first shave back with my trusty kit this morning was *so* good. I almost forgot what it felt like to have such a smooth shave. And the smells...I can't get enough of that Y/R/P, it's easily become my favorite scent in my collection. I felt like I rediscovered wet shaving all over again for those 20 minutes this morning and it feels good, man...",

I like it. I have a small sample bottle of AdP Colonia EdT and it smells close enough for my nose. I don't find it to be cloying like the other small sample of an older (maybe reformulation?) of Fine IC I got to try. That one was lemony cleaner, this one seems to be a much better balance. Just wondering if I'm broke or if it really does smell pretty good to the pro's noses. Still can't get a **great** shave from any of the Fine pucks, really don't know why. Oh well, I'll keep trying.",

L&B was probably my first artisan soap. I've had this tub for years, and probably haven't used it in a year or more. Is there anyway it got better? Maybe my memory is just poor, but I feel like the consistency of the soap had firmed up a bit, and I almost feel like I got a better lather from it. Is it possible a soap can get better with age? Anyway, a very nice, citrus theme shaved, with the only non-Maggard product being the Vokshod blade.",

Probably my favorite sample I have right now. Only downside is that I can't get in to the Stirling alcohol splashes. They all seem to leave an odd note (quoth my fiancée: \"Why do you smell like carrots?\") that I find artificial and off-putting. Which is strange because I find all of their soap scents amazingly wonderful. Fortunately smelling around the den has me convinced this will pair well with BR Classic, which I'll use with it next time.",

This wasn't a sample, but I really liked the smell so wanted to use it. Got this and ToBS Coconut from the BOGO Amazon deal over the weekend.

Haven't used Leviathan in awhile and it smells heavenly, so going to smell like that for the day.\n\nedit: Holy DFS Batman! The C&F soap (tallow version) whipped up a furious lather effortlessly. The Black Tie scent, while not bad, but was kind of ho hum; just not a lot to it imo. Of the other samples I got, the [Fresh Start](https://trythatsoap.com/collection/596/?product_type=soap) smelled much more engaging. Will probably give that a go tomorrow. Don't need to say much about Leviathan. Didn't have any stinging when I put it on though, which is a testament to the great shave today!",

Almost as good as my V3A for a single-pass shave, which I consider a success considering I probably don't have the ideal angle yet. This week I've been concentrating on doing single-pass, irritation-free shaves. Not just for comfort or time, but mostly because I got a shit ton of soaps over the weekend. So far I've gone through T&S YRP (Love it!), T&S Grog (LOOOOVE IT), and Sunset from Catie's Bubbles today (really really like it). In the tub, I mostly smelled the lavender. Once I lathered up and got it on my face, the vetiver exploded and I really really like the blend of the two. My only previous experience with vetiver was Marshlands, which I had mixed feelings on. This soap smells really dark and relaxing and I just really love it. Looking forward to trying the Anne Bonny, Soap Commander Honor, and First Canadian soaps that I also got over the next 3 days :D",

I admittedly have no idea what real Juniper smells like, but to me the soap smells like vetiver and sage. Since those are two of the three notes, I imagine Juniper is there, too. Performance was really good. Nice dense, shiny, and wet lather. Somehow an improvement over the Select v.2 formula.\n\nThere are varying opinions on Hart and Classic Shaving was recently acquired by some grooming network that owns grim blades. The whole arrangement didn't instill confidence in buying from them, but the razors were half off and I got this 6/8 square point and a 5/8 round point for less than another shop sells a single razor. Very smooth shaver and has a decent heft to it. No regrets for sure.",

I already had the adjustable vintage Gillettes, so the precursor TTO models were not of any specific interest. However, I was on the lookout for a Z-2 date code Gillette as it is a birth quarter razor for my father, and when /u/falcons1583 put this one on the bazaar I grabbed it. My father was born in May of 1954, and passed away last August, not long after I had started wet shaving. My parents were supposed to be coming in for a visit on a Sunday in early August, and I had planned on talking to him about wet shaving and if had ever used the traditional process when he was younger. The night before they were supposed to come though, my mother called and said she was taking him to the emergency room. He never made it out of the hospital, and we never got to have that conversation.\n\nAfter that, I kept my eye out for Z-2 razors. This one is in pretty good shape as it is, but I'm probably going to get it re-plated and give it to my Brother-in-law for a birthday gift later in the year. I have 2 daughters (well, will have in about 6 weeks), but my sister has two little boys, and the older boy, who is going on 5, took losing his grandpa very badly. They spent lots of time together, and always wore these matching copper colored fishing shirts. So, my plan is to send it to Delta Echo, and have it restored in copper and black, and give it to my BIL, so he can pass it down when the time is right. In the meantime, I've used it a couple of times to check it out.\n\nSo, how does it shave. Honestly this was only the 3rd or 4th time I've used it. It's a very similar shave to the Fatboy and Slim on their lower settings, maybe at a 2 or a 3. Very mild. Efficient enough though, and if you dialed it in could probably be a great daily shaver, but not something I would reach for if not for sentiment. I think it would make a very good beginner's razor though, and hopefully it will convert my BIL.\n\n\n\nHave a good one!\n\n\n\n**Razors**\n\n[<< 1962 Gillette Slim Adjustable, Aggressive Setting](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5mwp4p/monday_sotd_thread_jan_09_2017/dc709rx/)\n\n[Parker Variant, Mild Setting >>](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5nb6x1/wednesday_sotd_thread_jan_11_2017/dca7ux1/)\n****\n\n**Tours**\n\n[Razor Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5lefc9/happy_new_year_sotd_thread_jan_01_2017/dbv6f4p/)\n\n[Brush Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5o322q/sunday_sotd_thread_jan_15_2017/dcgf5ud/)\n\n[Soap Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5q99m5/thursday_sotd_thread_jan_26_2017/dcxird1/)",

Not the easiest thing to lather though, I'm still working on a good technique for glycerin soaps. I get a good lather, but a ton of it, far more than I can use even with 3 passes. The brush is just a well used one in my collection, it has held up really well even after 2 years. Not the fanciest of brushes, but it gets the job done. I was given the Fendrihan mug by my boss yesterday (I converted him a few weeks ago and hes going full bore with it), and I enjoyed it a lot. It's probably twice the size of my Captains Choice so a little bulky to handle, but it had plenty of room for the lather. The aftershave balm is just as great as the soap, with a great warming feel to it on your skin. The Merkur 25c is my old faithful, it was the first \"real\" razor I bought and it's served me well. Im relatively new to the Astra, I started trying them out a few weeks ago and I like them, very sharp, very consistent, and a little bit cheaper than the Feathers or Personas.\n\nAll in all a great start to the day and if anyone has any tricks for glycerin lathering without overflowing my mug I'm all ears!\n\n[THE GEAR](http://i.imgur.com/RNkXZv6.jpg)",

Wife and son went to the in laws which means I'm only getting out of bed to shower and shave. Stupid cold. Figured something nice and bright would be good. This soap is sold as a cream but is a typical soft Italian soap. I split it with someone and have it in the ceramic pot that Scottish Fine Soaps shave soap comes in. Since it's not air tight it has firmed up quite a bit. Harder then most artisan soaps but not quite triple milled. Stuff still smells wonderful and lathers like a champ.",

And I agree that it is just a super creamy, slick soap. The face feel is first-rate. I have no idea I even owned the Neutrogena lotion, but found it in my box-o-shave. I went straight to Myrsol without my usual Thayers, so I figured I hit my face with a little extra moisturizer. First part of today calls for snow shifting to freezing rain and then to just rain. I am not a big balm guy, but my face feels nice without being greasy. Great Tuesday shaves to all.",

Best so far with the duck. Plus Fletcher and US are so good, and work very well together. On a somewhat related note, I saved my tin of Fletcher from disaster this morning. I had left it out on the sink to dry overnight. My wife washed her face in that sink this morning. I came in just after her (thankfully) and found that she had gotten quite a bit of water in my Fletcher tin (like over 1/4\" over the top of the soap). No harm done and that point, and I just poured the water off, but I'm glad I noticed when I did, instead of coming home to a ruined soap this evening!",

Anyway, went with some weather appropriate scents, plus Bergamot Lavender is a pleasant scent for a day at work where our bosses are on a raising productivity kick. Also stopped counting blade uses and decided to just feel for when it was time to change. Kind of scary but kind of fun as I let the blade tell me what's what. Enjoyed this shave, not using DEs much lately due to the General, but this reminds me to work them in more frequently.",

I'll give that a shot later this week or early next week.\n\nDid I mention how much I love this Tuxedo knot? It's freaking fantastic. I have one of the 30mm ones, and I need to find a handle for it, because I can't wait to try it out as well. The custom handle I have the knot in is beautiful as well.

Was out all morning running from drs appointments for the kids got home 5 mins before the bufflehead drop and had it in my cart and was screwed at checkout :(. So then I guess I rushed this shave and it wasn't good was going to go with Italian barber the stallion and that was a no go after how rough the shave was.",

I loved it. It's like an abstract painting, I don't really appreciate them as much, but if I took the time, try to understand what the artist was trying to convey, it's like a whole different painting I'm looking at.\n\nPerformance was excellent as usual. Very comfortable, residual slickness is great, protection, cushion, it's all there.\n\nMy face feels like a million bucks.\n\nAs for the A/S, I am also digging the TSM Fougere. It reminds me of a more flower-y Green Irish Tweed. Still masculine but more colorful than the usual fougere, if that makes any sense. It's old school but has a youthful vibe hiding in the background.",

The 1924 sounded like a good way to mow down everything and mow everything it did, even the little blemish I had (emphasis on had) on my head.\n\nThat being said, I had a terrible shave on my face. Two passes normally gets me pretty smooth but I'm left with stubble all over my cheeks and neck. Oddly enough, my chin is bbs smooth. Also, some people call this the \"shovelhead\" and after trying to get under my nose, I can appreciate the name. I finally gave up and will get that stubble later with another razor. This will be another razor that I need to revisit and master...\n",

The Parker Variant adjustable. I've been taking the razor tour in the order in which I obtained the razors, so I still have a couple of other ones to reach for after this one, but neither of them unseated this one as my favorite.\n\nStylistically, it's not the most impressive razor in the world. It has a clean and uncomplicated look, if slightly bulky in appearance, and the option for a black handle is nice, but no one is going to mistake this for hand finished stainless steel masterwork. The head size is fairly close to a Fatboy or Slim, but a bit thicker in height from the bottom of the base plate to the top cap. With a plated brass chassis, it's quite heavy, and the handle diameter is on the larger size, comparable with a Fatboy, but longer. It feels solid and well made, but my real complaint is that the top cap is zamak. If it were solid brass, it would be a no brainer desert island razor for me, but the top cap is a weak point. The looks and construction however, aren't going to win this razor a prize. The usage though, for me at least, is what makes this razor.\n\nThe first time I used this razor it was a revelation for me. It was the first time I achieved a completely effortless BBS shave, with nothing in the same zip code as irritation. I'd gotten comfortable BBS shaves before, but not with this level of ease. For me the feedback from this razor during the shave is unparalleled, and a key contributor to the ease of shaving. It provides solid audible feedback, and even though it is heavy, good tactile feedback through the handle, allowing for easily finding the right angle to hit with the blade. I think this is from the higher blade exposure presented by the razor. Even with the gap dialed down to the minimum, the feedback is good. The most similar razor I have in terms of feel, is the Maggard V3A. The Variant provides blade feel much like the V3A, only smoother, and more comfortable. The V3A probably most closely resembles the Parker, on a setting of around 2.\n\n\n\nHave a good one!\n\n\n\n**Razors**\n\n[<< 1954 Gillette Flare Tip Super Speed](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5n41cx/tuesday_sotd_thread_jan_10_2017/dc8mm0w/)\n\n[Parker Variant, Aggressive Setting >>](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5nidsq/thursday_sotd_thread_jan_12_2017/dcbv8aj/)\n****\n\n**Tours**\n\n[Razor Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5lefc9/happy_new_year_sotd_thread_jan_01_2017/dbv6f4p/)\n\n[Brush Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5o322q/sunday_sotd_thread_jan_15_2017/dcgf5ud/)\n\n[Soap Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5q99m5/thursday_sotd_thread_jan_26_2017/dcxird1/)",

First impressions are excellent. I'd say it competes with any of the other soaps I've got kicking around (aka, basically all of the them). Very slick, certainly among the slicker soaps in my den. I did a touch up pass at the end without re-lathering, just a splash of water, and slickness wasn't an issue. To u/Fahrenheit915, I'll use it again a few times and give you my final thoughts.\n\nI believe he mentioned that this scent is just an off-the-shelf FO, but that doesn't make it any less fantastic. I didn't get both out to compare, but it struck me as being really close to Dapper Dragon's Lavender Lizard (which is awesome).",

Been real busy to start my 2017. Anyhow, yesterday there was a mini discussion about Fine *Italian Citrus*. Heads up /u/drivenlegend - Once I unboxed the soap, I did indeed pick up a stronger \"lemon cleaner\" scent. It made for a wonderful air freshener for the bathroom. Anyhow, this is my first time with any Fine soap. Once I got to lathering, I noticed that this soap can take a good deal of water. Once I added enough, it was a very creamy, slick lather. Top-flight in my book. I also noticed that the scent changed from \"lemon cleaner\" to a stronger *Capri* from Folsom & Co. So, in summary, the soap is absolutely terrific in its shave qualities as well as a nice robust *Italian Citrus* scent. The aftershave is damn near F&C *Capri* (which is fantastic). Now I don't have to hang on to my *Capri* forever knowing that Fine *IC* can step in. Great Wednesday shaves to all.",

First off, this Elite knot is WAAAY oversized. With the glue bump protruding out of the side, I had to widen the bore to 27.5 mm for it to barely fit in the handle. I think this is possibly a mislabeled 26mm, it's way too dense and wide to be a 24mm, and is only slightly smaller than my Romera 28mm knots, so moving forward I'm just calling it a 26mm. I set it Monday night to 50mm, and test lathered it Tuesday morning only to decide I had it set a little too high for my preference. I removed the knot, sanded the spacer I used at the bottom 2 more mm to bring it down to a 48mm loft. This was the right decision. I've only test lathered it 3 times and gave it a go this evening, and am absolutely LOVING this knot! Dense with good backbone, and the tips are soft soft soft!!! I look forward to what this one will develop into after some use!\n\nRock rock on!!!",

Needed some WK in my life. The combo of this soap and C.Lux salves is kind of ridiculous. My face feels stupid good.\n\nEdit: So I still feel like shit. This cold is not going away. But I don't care. I don't know if any of you remember but so any months back I had asked my boss for a raise. He said yeah but nothing ever happened. Finally though it came through. For whatever reason he was waiting for the new year. About 7% which I'm happy with. I was hoping for 10% but 7 was where I'd settle so I'll take it. Plus he covers our benefits med and dental 100% so all in all I'm in a very good mood this morning.\n\n",

Rainforest is good enough that I didn't need to relather to make a touch up pass so it's all good.\n\nSpeaking of Rainforest, and all T+S soaps, presentation is top notch. The stamp in the soap almost makes me not want to use it and the labels look so professional.

Each day the shave getting easier and better than the day before. Being a continuous analog dial, there is no reason you can't keep dialing it up after the maximum 5 setting. I pushed it to 5 + 2 before stopping, but the shave didn't change at all past 5. At +2 there started to be some slight top cap instability. It was only noticeable when swishing and shaking off the razor between strokes, but it was enough to make me stop there. Since then, I've dialed it into 5 as my preference and left it there.\n\nFor me, it hasn't gotten any better than this. The overall feel of the shave is not much different at the higher setting than the lower one, but with the large gap, there is a little extra blade control. No odd angle or flat spot is a safe harbor for stubble, which gets removed with incredible efficiency. And with that large gap (see photo above), it's going to have no problem mowing through multiple days of growth without issue. With the best shaves I was getting prior to the Parker, I could usually start to feel my stubble starting to bud back out somewhere around mid-morning. Today though, just like yesterday, I anticipate my BBS will last all the way through lunch, and little beyond. The only other razor to ever get me that level of closeness is the Mühle R41, which I hadn't yet experienced when I first starting using the Parker.\n\nIn fact, after the first week with this razor, I was completely flummoxed as to how to explain the great shaves I was getting. I just didn't have the vocabulary, or experience with any razor I could compare it too, to properly understand what I was experiencing. It took me some time to reflect and research, to realize that what I was experiencing, was the touch of a more \"aggressive\" razor. I didn't really understand it since not only was it not shredding my face, it was more comfortable and easy to use than the mild razors and settings I'd been using before. It went contrary to my previous conceptions and it took that some time to sink in. I went back and tried the Slim again after that, dialed all the way up. While it did give me the best shave I'd ever gotten from a Slim, it still didn't touch what I was getting out of the Parker.\n\nI realize this razor is probably not for everyone. It's fairly aggressive, and even though the gap is adjustable, it has quite a bit of blade exposure that is unchanged by adjustment. For me that translates to great blade feel, while still being very comfortable. For others, it may seem harsh, or be prone to nicks, a problem I've never had. If you're out there looking for another razor option though, I would highly recommend giving this one a try, you might find like myself, that it gives you great shaves.\n\n\n\nHave a good one!\n\n\n\n**Razors**\n\n<< [Parker Variant, Mild Setting](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5nb6x1/wednesday_sotd_thread_jan_11_2017/dca7ux1/)\n\n[2013 Mühle R41 >>](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5npmem/friday_sotd_thread_jan_13_2017/dcdgu55/)\n****\n\n**Tours**\n\n[Razor Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5lefc9/happy_new_year_sotd_thread_jan_01_2017/dbv6f4p/)\n\n[Brush Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5o322q/sunday_sotd_thread_jan_15_2017/dcgf5ud/)\n\n[Soap Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5q99m5/thursday_sotd_thread_jan_26_2017/dcxird1/)",

I haven't even taken the wrapper off the soap yet and I can clearly smell that it is an exact match to Strop Shoppe's Baker Street. So happy the scent strength is stronger. I did put on some of the splash as I was walking out the door this morning, 2 hours later and I can still smell it.\n\nI can easily see this scent becoming Stirling's best seller. I know I'll be buying the full set (including bath items) once they are released, hopefully it will be soon. /u/stirlingsoap knocked it out of the park!",

Shave was just as good this time. The *Ghost Town Barber* sample looks like it still has a few shaves left in it. I still don't know how the rest of you go through soap so quickly.\n\nI'd forgotten how nice a brush the SOC is; it's like a big pillow of soft, split-end boar bristle love on my face, if a li'l floppy and lather-eating.\n\nIs anyone else familiar with the Star DE? It's the razor that, legend has it, inspired the design of the Gillette Tech. The one that I have is a bit milder than my pre-war Tech, but still a smooth, comfortable shave with a 7 O'Clock SharpEdge. It provided a quick, effortless 2-pass BBS this morning, which was nice, because I slept horribly last night and woke up late today, and thus was in a bit of a rush.\n\nAnyway, have a great Thursday, all. Weekend's nearly here.",

Honestly, I can't feel a difference between the two. They both smell fantastic and whip up very creamy lather that feels wonderful on the face. But the performance difference between the two is undetectable by me.\n\nFellows, let me tell you about two extremely generous wetshavers: /u/hawns and /u/chevro1et.\n\nI placed an order full of annoying (to /u/hawns, I'd bet) samples via the CL website before Christmas. He asked if I could wait a little longer for delivery while he works through other Christmas orders he got. Of course, I said sure. Before placing the order I expressed interest in getting a sample of Catalan's Prairie salve since he was doing another run of it. Unfortunately, he wasn't doing samples of CP this time around. No problem. Well, my package arrived just the other day and what do I find in the box? A full 2 oz jar of Catalan's Prairie salve! It was his gift to me for being patient about the shipping. Absolutely wonderful. Thank you! Completely unexpected and very appreciated.\n\n/u/chevro1et, I think, took personal offense that I did not have a badger brush. Ha! He lent me his superb C&R Envy White for well over a month now. Maybe two. It is an exceptional brush. Out of the goodness of his heart in wanting me to have a high quality badger brush he gifted it to me today. That's right, he gave it to me for free. Unreal! I was speechless and really didn't know what to say other than ***thank you***, profusely. What a guy.\n\nIsn't it nice to know there's two fine fellows like these among us?",

The 1305 was made out of a used brillo pad for its hair and my 610 started to molt once it was broken in. So, bad luck with both. Since I am a stubborn S.O.B., I went ahead and picked up the Semogue SOC with a cherry handle by trade with the impeccable /u/arbarnes. (Also picked up the Maggard V3A and MR5 handle used in this morning's shave). Man, this is more like it! I tend to gravitate toward a bigger knot and this is it. It is smaller than my RR boar, which is good. That knot is a bit too big. Great backbone with soft tips. What anyone looks to get out of a brush. Also, this is my first go with the well received Maggard V3A head. This is right up my alley in regard to efficiency. I would say it is in the same neighborhood as my ATT R1 head. Aggressive but not too aggressive. A quick shout-out to /u/BungleBungleBungle: I got my MR5 handle back! Oh yeah, *LEVIATHAN!!!!* Great Thursday shaves to all.",

I didn't know what to expect from it, but it's very well blended. The citrus top notes came together with the florals excellently so that they worked in tandem and were balanced excellently with the musk and wood underneath. Also, the pomade, when first applied, seemed like it was going to be too light. After running the comb through it, however, I was surprised to find that my hair still had plenty of control without feeling heavy in the least. It's nice stuff, plus the citrus scent is a nice complement to my current pomade rotation (Grand Havana, Kraken, and Crystal Lake).\n\nAll in all, it was a great trip to the doctor's office today.",

I also wasn't very used to the blade angle (I started with the handle perpendicular to the ground and worked my way up), so I wasn't sure how well it was shaving. By the third pass, though, I knew I had something special. Even with a terrible lather, this blade took every little bit of hair off my face, and the auditory feedback was incredible. If my old Tech was singing like this, it would normally mean that I had too harsh of an angle, but I couldn't even feel the blade during each pass. It was so smooth that I went for an aggressive ATG pass, which I usually never do because of irritation. I still need to fine-tune my technique with this razor (any tips you have would be appreciated), but I can already tell that this is the best razor I have ever used. If you see one of these in the wild, do not hesitate to pick it up.",

The puck of paste is bright blue, and the only scent I picked up from the jar was camphor. But it loaded easily, and as the lather developed the sage came to the forefront. There's a touch of wood and smoke underneath it, too - maybe that's the amyris? I don't get anything that reminds me of the ocean, but it's a great scent nevertheless.\n\nThe lather itself was top-tier, with a touch of menthol-like cooling from the camphor and good residual slickness and post-shave feel. Gotta say, though, the packaging is what really sets this soap apart; the heavy glass jar is gorgeous and feels great in the hand. Highly recommend.",

I wanted to talk about it, recommend it for others, but anyone could have stopped me in my tracks by simply asking: why? Why should I get one of these? I wouldn't be able to say. \"Because it works great for me\" isn't a good reason to give someone else. During this period, I had also started thinking that \"aggressiveness\" was at the heart of the matter.\n\nTo test this theory, I went out and procured a couple of razors considered by others as aggressive, the Mühle R41 and the Maggard V3A. The Mühle came in first, and I quickly used it for a few days to attempt to provide points of comparison back to the Parker. After the first shave with the R41, I was still left puzzled. The shave it provides is quite different than anything else I had used, and wasn't immediately reminiscent of the Parker. I wondered if maybe I had been thinking down the wrong track. But after a few more shaves, I came to realize it was exactly like the Parker in probably the most important way. Three passes with it was leaving me completely BBS for a good long period of the morning, with no effort and extreme comfort. The exact thing the Parker was doing. It just feels totally different while doing so.\n\nI can only offer up my observations of the head geometry as to the reason for the different feel. With the R41, the blade exposure from the edge of the top cap is fairly small. There is also not a huge blade gap. However, there is a good amount of blade exposure past the plane created from the base plate to the top cap. This means the razor is usable from a very wide array of angles, and provides a good amount of face feel. For some reason among these characteristics, it just doesn't translate into as much tactile or audible feedback as other razors, but seems rather firm.\n\nIn the end, using face feel as my primary guide, I can get extremely close comfortable shaves from this razor. Without the exploration to find answers, I may never have ventured off into trying a razor like this, but I'm glad I did. I found another razor that gives me great shaves.\n\n\n\n\nHave a good one!\n\n\n\n**Razors**\n\n[<< Parker Variant, Aggressive Setting](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5nidsq/thursday_sotd_thread_jan_12_2017/dcbv8aj/)\n\n[Maggard V3A >>](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5nwlrs/saturday_sotd_thread_jan_14_2017/dcf1kc8/)\n****\n\n**Tours**\n\n[Razor Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5lefc9/happy_new_year_sotd_thread_jan_01_2017/dbv6f4p/)\n\n[Brush Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5o322q/sunday_sotd_thread_jan_15_2017/dcgf5ud/)\n\n[Soap Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5q99m5/thursday_sotd_thread_jan_26_2017/dcxird1/)",

It will bite if not treated with respect but with a little care it delivers a superb shave. I can get pretty damn close to BBS in a single pass.

I am really loving the Duck. Russian Tea is awesome as always, and I love the pairing with GLS. Honestly, I'm generally not a huge fan of THB matte clay on it's own, but I had a bunch of residual goon grease in my hair, and together they performed great! Happy M-fing Friday!",

Stacking them seems to be the easiest and most space-efficient way of storing them. The obvious down side of this is that the soaps lower down are harder to get to, and therefore less likely to be used. In a way, the less popular soaps are \"rotated\" out.\n\nI've been making an effort to use some soaps that have fallen out of rotation. Mike's Barbershop was the first artisan soap I purchased. To date it's the only soap I've loved enough to restock after finishing. (Leviathan is the other.) I love the scent and the Mike's soap base is IMO among the best.\n\nIf I had a criticism, it'd be that the soap is inclined to produce a dry lather. Of course, that's not the soap's fault. It'd be more fair to say that it requires more water than most other soaps you might be used to. Knowing this going in, I didn't shake as much water out of my brush as I normally would. The results were bloody brilliant.\n\nFine American Blend was my first aftershave purchase. It's a very basic formula of alcohol fragrance & menthol, so I tend to overlook it in favor of some of the more sophisticated splashes (i.e. Chatillon Lux, B&M). But sometimes it's just nice to get back to the basics.\n\nJesus, blah, blah, blah why don't ya? Anyway, have a great weekend everyone. The forecast says we'll be getting freezing rain all weekend, so I'll be braving the grocery store to stock up after work.\n\nGo Chiefs!",

This was my first \"homeless\" shave. The past few months have been difficult to say the least. I find some comfort in the shaving ritual as my life seems to swirl around me. This shave was just okay. I had about a week's worth of growth and the incoming beard was giving me some irritation below the neck. Finished off a Topanga Fougere sample I've had almost since I started with the DE. Great scent but it gives me a slight burning sensation after a while. It seems like everyone got a G20 scuttle for xmas. Still trying to figure out the ideal water temperature to fill it with. I think Rapira Platinum Lux blades may be bulk buy worthy. I'd like to test a couple more blades then another Platinum Lux before making a decision. Picked up a couple of Gold Dollar 66's and some lapping film. Excited to play with those. Tried a Bvlgari Green Tea Refreshing towel that came with my bottle of Guerlain Vetiver; a light green tea scent that lasted a few hours. Later I spritz'd myself with some Azzaro Pour Homme at Macy's. Fougere, barbasol, anise, barbershop deliciousness!",

First impressions of this soap were great. Right off the puck, I get a deep roasted smell with some sweetness from the vanilla. I'm no scent expert but I didn't get much of the blood orange. Scent strength was mid-strong and stuck around throughout the shave. Performance was unbelievable, easily the finest lather I've used even with my admittedly imperfect technique. Quick to lather up and a slick, cushiony final product. The scent didn't stick around much after the shave, which I expected. Overall, extremely happy with my purchase! Another winner!\n\nHave a good one folks, it's a long weekend!",

Honestly can't smell the blood orange, but maybe I'll try looking for it when I sniff it in the morning.

Smelling straight out of the jar wasn't what I expected, it had an unexpected almost acidic note to it. Lathering it up though, it all balanced out. The level of menthol is just perfect, it wasn't all that noticeable until the second pass. Just enough to give the feeling of a slight nip in the air. Looking forward to using the Latha Taiga sample I've got, which is also fir, but taken in a different direction.",

I figured I'd throw up a SOTD, based on this assumingly unkown soap. I searched fairly thoroughly for English language based assessments on this baby and found nothing. Plenty of Spanish and French reviews. Language translation is a beautiful thing.\n\nThis was my absolute, first go with a hard soap. It seems I am very slow and more to the point, retarded in trying different types of shavings products. I loaded soaking wet and like a rabid Tasmanian devil. I overloaded a bit and thought my lather was a bit on the thick side. I found it acceptable and the soap was as good as many of the other beauties we all know.\n\nThe scent is in the vein of Cade Rich and Pre de Provence. Very natural in the almost soap-base category. In my quest for specific information on this Marseilles machination, I learned that alum containing shaving soaps had been/are a Mediterranean tradition.\n\nI took a chance on this soap in the spirit of exploration. Would I recommend it? Sure, if you want a basic, clean scented soap. No regrets here. We buy and try. That's the nature of the beast.\n\nKeep on keeping on, gentlemen. And by all means, enjoy the shaves......\n",

Had a good amount of irritation today but I am going to put that down to not hitting the correct angle on the Hydro. There is no mincing around with the scent, cherries galore. As for the scent I'm not sure if i will pick up a full puck of it. While I like cherries, I prefer B&M Adagio or Dickens because there is more depth to those scents, but I will still use it, it will be nice for when I feel like wearing a non-complex scent.\n\nHave a splendid Saturday.",

After trying the R41 to get my comparison point for the Parker, I moved on to the Maggard and Immediately knew I had my answer. The V3A feels very similar to the Parker. I've seen others say it is close to the 3 or 4 setting, but for me it feels like it matches up somewhere between the 2 and 3 mark. This is the one that let me know for certain that it was the more \"aggressive\" nature of the Variant that I was really enjoying. Feedback and blade feel were what I was experiencing that was making the shaves better and more enjoyable.\n\nFor me the V3A is a very efficient shaver, yet provides a very comfortable shave. If I couldn't use the Variant, this would be the razor I reached for the most. I wish there was just a little more feedback during the shave, but it provides enough feedback and blade feel to get the angles into the right ballpark pretty easily. Even though it has been a few weeks since I used it, I lathered up and managed an easy, 3 pass, smooth as silk shave with it. No irritation. At $20 paired with the MR11 handle, or $9 for just the head, this is an unbelievably good value for someone wanting a modern razor. It's a couple of bucks cheaper than my original 23C, yet provides shaves with 3 times the quality. If you want a budget friendly way to explore out past that first razor you picked up, or just add some variety to shave routine, this one could be your answer too.\n\n\n\nHave a good one!\n\n\n\n**Razors**\n\n[<< 2013 Mühle R41](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5npmem/friday_sotd_thread_jan_13_2017/dcdgu55/)\n****\n\n**Tours**\n\n[Razor Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5lefc9/happy_new_year_sotd_thread_jan_01_2017/dbv6f4p/)\n\n[Brush Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5o322q/sunday_sotd_thread_jan_15_2017/dcgf5ud/)",

Got 11 samples, 3 chapsticks, and a brush. And I was gifted a sample of Gatlinburg bath soap. Super excited to try the soaps out as I've never shaved with a Stirling soap before, but *something else* took priority this morning.\n\nWhat I *did* get to use this morning from the order was the brush! Up until today I've only used a complete shit badger (a long time ago) and a super soft, swanky, big, pillowy silvertip. So I wasn't sure what to expect. And I *loved* it. Amazing value. Even on the first shave it was soft and efficient and I really like the amount of backbone. Really a magnificent knot at any price, and considering how ridiculously affordable it is it may be one of the best value shaving purchases of my life. Super impressed; cannot recommend highly enough. Thanks for this one, u/stirlingsoap. I don't know how you made this work.\n\nStill working out that puzzle. Gonna be more or less guessing out of my ass about it. Sigh. On a positive note, the scent is really growing on me. I was a little reticent at first, but I quite like it now. And the wife approves, which is a win, as we dont always see nose to nose... er, smell eye to eye... er... we sometimes disagree about what smells good. Oh, and, the alcohol-free aftershave is great. Damn if all the L&L products aren't just amazing. All of the artisans are kicking serious ass. What a time to be a wet shaver.",

I was very pleased with it all. I've used cartridge and shaving cream and no matter what types I tried I always ended up with razor burn. It was never a pleasant shave, but more of a chore.\n\nI can say now, I look forward to shaving and wish my hair grew faster so I could shave every day as opposed to every second or third, haha. Still working on technique but haven't had anything too bad happen yet. I may end up down the rabbit hole of soap acquisition though :P",

      "body": "###[Brush-Tour: Perfecto Pure Badger, Black](http://imgur.com/a/W4fAd)\n****\n\n* **Prep**: Stirling Soap Co. - *Bergamot Lavender*\n* **Razor**: Maggard Razors - *V3A on MR11*\n* **Blade**: Gillette - *7 O'Clock Super Platinum* (2)\n* **Brush**: Perfecto - *Pure Badger* Black\n* **Lather**: Tallow + Steel/Chatillon Lux - *Yuzu/Rose/Patchouli*\n* **Splash**: Thayers - *Original Witch Hazel with Aloe Vera*\n* **Balm**: Chatillon Lux - *Yuzu/Rose/Patchouli*\n* **Frag**: Antonio Puig - *Quorum*\n\n****\n\n\n\nNow that the razor tour is done, I'm moving on to a brush tour. I had a tough time choosing the accompanying setup. I had such a great shave yesterday with the V3A, I decided to stick with it for the brush tour. Even though I have fewer things to pair it with, and no experience lathering a Tallow + Steel soap, I just couldn't wait any longer on getting my face into this Y/R/P collaboration. I did a single test lather last night, to make sure I could dial in with this soap, though I didn't expect any problems based on the high opinions I've seen, and it didn't disappoint. The only thing I regret, is that with this choice, I don't get a chance to use the Puzzle for today's big event.\n\n\n\nI really must give the people at Perfecto a hand on this brush. The fact that it doesn't have a 1 star average on amazon is mildly surprising. The fact that it's rated at 4.5 stars is nothing short of miraculous. The fact that their PR department has managed that level of rating for basically a piece of trash, deserves a big round of applause. I mean, there's gaming the system, then there's next-level market manipulation. Kudos.\n\nWhen I made my initial gear purchase, I was fooled like so many others by this. I vaguely had some idea that badger brushes were the best thing to have. Seeing this one for $11 (now $17... holy shit they're just going in dry now), I knew it wasn't going to be a great brush, I was aware of the general problem of Amazon inflated ratings. However, I thought, if it's rated at this level and volume, it's probably passable enough to find out if this was something I wanted to do, before investing in better equipment. Boy was I ever wrong. Before the razor ever met my face during my first shave, it was already sore and stinging. I loved making the lather in the bowl and the great smells, but just applying it to my face was harsh, and scratchy. It didn't help that I was also reacting pretty badly to the first cream I chose. Apparently, roughing up your skin, then smearing allergens into it isn't the first step on the road to a comfortable shave.\n\nThe poor reaction to the cream masked a little bit the roughness of the brush, but once I had a couple of soaps in hand that didn't cause me problems, it was becoming clear pretty quickly that this brush was doing me no favors. I tried face lathering with this brush, and after that I thought people who were recommending face lathering were either leather skinned or masochists. In retrospect, I don't know how much of my initial irritation problems were from my brush, and how much was from bad technique with my razor. Once I found my way to Reddit for some advice, I added in a new brush when ordering an upgrade to my razor, and this is the first time I've used it since.\n\nFinal verdict on this brush is that it needs to die in a fire. I've only kept it because it was the first one I ever owned, and I can be a sappy bastard about such things. That's barely saving it though, and even with its numero uno status, it will probably see a garbage bin at some point, as I wouldn't gift this thing to my worst enemy, much less resell it to some poor stranger. Today's full face lather with this porcupine was rough and unpleasant, and left me picking clipped badger hairs out of my soap. Luckily this soap lived up to the hype, provided a smooth easy glide for the razor, and left my skin nourished, because it needed all the help it could get after the initial abuse it took from the Perfecto.\n\n\n\n\nHave a good one!\n\n\n\n**Brushes**\n\n[Maggard Razors 22mm Black Synthetic, Bronze Handle >>](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5o9vom/monday_sotd_thread_jan_16_2017/dchtppv/)\n****\n\n**Tours**\n\n[Razor Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5lefc9/happy_new_year_sotd_thread_jan_01_2017/dbv6f4p/)\n\n[Brush Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5o322q/sunday_sotd_thread_jan_15_2017/dcgf5ud/)\n\n[Soap Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5q99m5/thursday_sotd_thread_jan_26_2017/dcxird1/)",

The preciseness of how the blade fits in is amazing. The only other OC razor I have is the Maggard's OC, in which this is pretty different. The Maggard's OC doesn't really have a gap at all, with the blade resting on the comb. With the wolfy, there most certain is a gap (standard gap in this case). Either way, very enjoyable shave, no cuts, and it looks fan-freaking-tastic.\n\nAs far as North York goes, I assumed there would be more orange based on the initial description, but it's almost entirely vanilla coffee, with just a tad bit of barley. I don't smell the blood orange at all; lathered or off the puck. It's definitely a sweeter scent, to the point that after my initial sniff, I thought it might have been too sweet. It mellows out a tad bit during the lather, but overall, this is a fantastic coffee scent if you're into that.\n\n\n",

I can't tell what's in this scent. It was a little off putting at first but it has grown on me. It smells like fougere, but there's citrus in it. Almost as if...Baudelaire and 4711 had a baby. It's an interesting scent, and a nice one too.\n\nGreat performance on the soap, and this blade in combination with the razor was so damn smooth. No irritation, cuts, or weepers. I felt like I didn't even need an aftershave, but I threw it on anyway.\n\nGreat stuff.\n\nHave an awesome Sunday guys! Im off to the flea market to hopefully find some hidden goodies!",

When I was done I rubbed the liniment on my hands to warm it up and to get more scent. It worked in that I got more scent notes than before. I'm pretty sure I'm failing at this miserably but I'm giving it a shot. Overall though, this has been a fun game.",

Puzzle is my favourite scent of any soap out there right now (perhaps I'm biased, but whatever, it's great). In order to keep things fair, I will not be participating in the puzzle contest today. It wouldn't look good if the organiser of the group buy ended up walking away with the prize. I have entered my own guesses privately with /u/landlgrooming (shave bros today?), and I was dismayed to learn that I can't discern any of the notes: 0/5.\n\nIn order to keep things fair, I now know the answer to puzzle, and will be able to confirm the winner if there is one. /u/BostonPhotoTourist I'm hoping that you'll actually play today.

This was a terrible idea, especially since I had butchered my face the previous day with a rushed shave before work. While I'm used to riding the cap on a DE, I still couldn't get the angle dialed in very well on the FW. When combined with a larger cutting plane, it made for a less comfortable shave than I was hoping for. I'll need to take some time to play with this new style of razor to get the technique down right. All of this to say that I needed a nice, comfortable shave today, so the hydro-magic and L&L combination were a godsend.\n\nI was hoping to find time to sit down and compare all of my soaps with Puzzle, the goal being to figure out which notes it shared with the others. Unfortunately, I have work today, and I think I ran myself out of time. Oh well. Good luck to all of you!",

I love using Stirling Body Butter as aftershave, it just makes me so soft.\n\nThe Calypso I bought because it matches my [MR18c](https://i.imgur.com/BiniLUA.jpg) beautifully and I love the shave I get from it. It was rough going at first, but I quickly made the adjustments needed and now I can shave with no irritation or cuts.",

I was psyched to try it out since I've been curious about adjustable for awhile. I think I just got the best shave of my life.\n\nI had 3 days of growth and went 9/6/3 with a 1 touchup on my problem areas where I usually have stubble that I can't get rid of and usually get irritation trying to get rid of said stubble. I got the smoothest, most amazing shave of my life. All my trouble spots are smooth with no irritation. My face feels wonderful. This may be the first BBS I've even gotten.\n\nI feel like heaping superlatives upon superlatives on this shave. I can't wait to shave again with on a normal amount of growth to see how the razor does. I tend to get better shaves on 3 days growth, so I can't wait to keep experimenting and see if this shave was just a result of that.\n\nAny tips for using an adjustable? I've never used one before.",

Prior to this, I had decided I was going to be a bowl lather guy, but the first time I used this one I decided to give the face lather one more shot. My eyes were opened, and I understood why everyone was recommending it. I've been face lathering ever since. The bowl now just sees use when I need something to load up a sample. The tips on this brush were so soft, I couldn't believe the difference. It felt so luxurious to use.\n\nIt worked up a great lather for me today. I've put a good number of lathers on a number of brushes since, but this one still stands out as my favorite synthetic of the three I own. It has the least backbone of them, but I wouldn't go so far as to call it floppy. It just doesn't try to produce that extra backbone that my other synthetics seem to attempt, which ends up giving them a springy feel. It's on the smaller size, and that combined with being synthetic, makes it my go-to travel brush on the rare occasions I've needed to shave on the road.\n\nThe final verdict on this one for me, is that this is a solid brush, especially considering the price. If this was the only brush I had, I could be happy with it, but I've since moved on and found that I prefer the feel of a good badger knot.\n\n\n\nHave a good one!\n\n\n\n\n\n**Brushes**\n\n[<< Perfecto Pure Badger, Black Handle](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5lkdvs/monday_sotd_thread_jan_02_2017/dbwgzzk/)\n\n[Maggard Razors 24mm Synthetic, Marble Handle >>](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5oh2kf/tuesday_sotd_thread_jan_17_2017/dcjekzj/)\n****\n\n**Tours**\n\n[Razor Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5lefc9/happy_new_year_sotd_thread_jan_01_2017/dbv6f4p/)\n\n[Brush Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5o322q/sunday_sotd_thread_jan_15_2017/dcgf5ud/)\n\n[Soap Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5q99m5/thursday_sotd_thread_jan_26_2017/dcxird1/)",

It was worth doing. With ~~46~~ 45 shaves on the blade, I needed a third pass against 4 days' growth, and it was definitely a bit tuggy on the first pass. Still, an irritation-free BBS. This blade still has some life in it, that's for sure.\n\nThis brush is a loaner from /u/fahrenheit915. Thank you again for letting me try it out! I measured the knot at 26mm, but it may be 24mm at the plug. /u/fahrenheit915, please feel free to correct me on that. I really enjoyed using it this morning. It holds what I perceive to be a ton of lather, and now I get how you badger guys go through soaps so quickly hahaha. Seriously, though, it ate much more soap than my comparably sized synthetics and my old 22mm EJ Best. The knot is also nice, dense, comfortable and scrubby.\n\nStill working on the *Ghost Town Barber* sample I've had since forever ago, and I also decided to break out another product I hadn't used in a while: L&L Grooming's original aftershave formulation. It is a ridiculously good feeling, and smelling, aftershave.\n\nAll in all, a good way to start the week. Now, it's off to work, which is a much less good way to continue the week. Happy Monday, all! Enjoy your shaves!\n\n\n\n-----\n**EDIT:** *Miscounted the number of shaves on my blade. That's what I get for not checking my log* before *I start writing these things.*",

I like it very much, the lather is abundant, stable and slick. 10 seconds of loading with my STF is easily enough for 3 passes. Postshave properties are excellent as well, due to the shea butter in the recipe no doubt.\n\nI'm not 100% sold on the scent, according to the maker it's black amber with bold Parisian lavendel. Combined with these main scents is a mysterious black myrrh, dulcet vanilla, tonka bean, and a splash of Egyptian musk and clary sage. It's very lavender-forward with quite some sweetness from the amber, vanilla and tonka bean.\n\nFinished another product today! The Nivea ASB is finished and will be replaced by Thayers Unscented.",

It would be fun to categorize my soaps based on the season and have a program that could select one at random for those days that I don't have a preference.\n\nHere's hoping everybody has a great week!",

I decided to really push it for BBS on about 24 hours growth and see if it would cause me any irritation. I did a 9/6/3/1 progression. I think pushing that fourth pass on 1 was a bit much. It caused me some irritation that it was not having after the 3 pass. That said, my problem areas have almost no irritation and then there's just a little bit of irritation in an area where I messed up the angle.\n\nThis adjustable really is amazing. I have never found a razor that allows me to get such a close shave, I think maybe one of my problems over the years was that my beard is coarse, and so I tend to go for aggressive razors, but those aggressive razors were causing me irritation on the 2nd and 3rd pass.\n\nI can't wait to continue using and experimenting with this razor.\n",

As I lather on my face it's okay, but once I stop it starts to tingle then burn and continues to get worse and worse until I get it all off. Thankfully that was the last of the sample I had. I'm also glad that it's the scent and not something to do with the L&L base, as the soap is really good.\n\nHope you all have a tacky Tuesday!",

When I first used it, I was disappointed. It didn't feel like an upgrade to the 22mm brush I had been using. It has more backbone than the all black knot, which in a synthetic creates an odd springy feel. This set me down a thought path, that made me believe I was not a fan of stiff backbone, which would take me quite some time to dispel. Along with the springy backbone, there is an odd feel when splaying, which spreads really wide on the face. The face splay on this is closer to what 26mm or 28mm splays like on a badger. This was something I had no experience with at the time, so I was amazed by people using 30mm brushes.\n\nThe lather creation however was never an issue with this brush. I've used it for bowl and face lathering both, and either way it's super efficient at lathering up. It requires a touch less soap than a natural bristle, and once lathered, releases it very easily. Just like the all black synthetic, the tips are incredibly soft, so comfort lathering is never an issue either. My only comparison at that point to natural bristles, was that awful Perfecto, so I put myself in the mindset that low backbone synthetics were my style and for the next couple of months, I went back and forth with this brush and the 22mm all black synthetic.\n\n\n\nHave a good one!\n\n\n\n**Brushes**\n\n[<< Maggard Razor, 22mm Black Synthetic, Bronze Handle](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5o9vom/monday_sotd_thread_jan_16_2017/dchtppv/)\n\n[Stirling Soap Co. 24mm Finest, Ivory Handle >>](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5oocvd/wednesday_sotd_thread_jan_18_2017/dckxm23/)\n****\n\n**Tours**\n\n[Razor Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5lefc9/happy_new_year_sotd_thread_jan_01_2017/dbv6f4p/)\n\n[Brush Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5o322q/sunday_sotd_thread_jan_15_2017/dcgf5ud/)\n\n[Soap Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5q99m5/thursday_sotd_thread_jan_26_2017/dcxird1/)",

It fit the bill nicely.\n\nAlso great on this cold, rainy January morning were my immortal *Ghost Town Barber* sample, *Gratiot League Square,* and the FS Finest. I'll be seriously shocked if I'm ever able to find a scent that *Ghost Town Barber* can't pair with. Using it regularly again has reminded me how much I love it; I'ma need to pick up the matching splash at some point to see if it's as magical as the soap.\n\nThe FS Finest is an awesome brush. I've gotten two great lathers from it so far, and I know I'm not loading it properly. I can't wait to see how it performs once I actually learn to use it correctly; I can already tell that's going to be amazeballs.\n\nWhat absolutely did not do right by me this morning was my G4. The first 4 shaves with it were good enough, although I found it to be very picky about its angles (much more so than any of my other injectors). Today's shave, though comfortable, was horribly inefficient. I did two passes plus touch-ups on a single day's growth and I'm still not as smooth as I'm accustomed to. I dunno if it's the razor, that particular blade, or if I'm simply spoiled, but it's a very interesting conundrum. I think I'ma load a Personna blade into it and see how well it does with that.\n\nAnyway, happy Tuesday, everyone! My best friend and I are going to see Blackalicious tonight, so I'm basically watching the clock tick until the day is over. Great shaves, and everything else, to all of you.\n\n\n\n-----\n**EDIT:** *Formatting.*",

I can get away with a DFS on one pass with the H2. It is one helluva efficient razor. Since the weather is in the mid-50s, I figured I'd bring out a nice fresh scent in *Ruby's Green*. Also noted that MLS aftershave is really fantastic. I know their soap is pretty much universally loved, but their aftershave is truly a nourishing finish to a shave. Great Tuesday shaves to all.",

It was a cheap and not terrible quality razor. I've been shaving with it for the last 3-4 days, and I find it shaves pretty well. It's a bit more aggressive than the Gillette Super Speed I used prior, and it isn't heavy, but has enough weight to it that it doesn't feel like a noodle in my hand. It's not a luxury model by any means, but it seems to do the job.\n\nTotally unrelated, but I'm starting my first watch of Cowboy Bebop. I'm not a huge anime fan, but the series is enjoyable thus far. Good soundtrack and intro song, too.",

I will say that I want to try loading more heavily next time, my blade has a good number of shaves on it already, *and* I was mowing down 3 days of growth. Anyway, I owe it another propert try.\n\nThe scent was very nice. Quite manly. I think that if you're a fan of Sherlock or Roam or generally anything leathery and masculine you'll find it quite pleasant. It reminds me a lot of Latha Taiga, as well, though darker and earthier and muskier. It's good stuff.\n\nAND THIS STIRLING BADGER BRUSH IS STUPID GOOD. UGH. I LIKE IT SO MUCH. EEERRRGH.",

While I can do the same in my Rockwell 6S, I find the swapping of the plates to be a real hassle to deal with just for those little spots. Definitely looking forward to the Rockwell Model T when it comes out in a few months. Last nights shave finally got around to using Ghost Ship and ended up with way too much soap on my brush. It was fun making a large amount of rich lather though. Great performance and a nice scent from Black Ship Grooming.",

Let me begin by saying I didn't buy into the hype for this razor, and I love my Maggard V3a for the closeness it's able to give me. The Rockwell gave me fantastic results, and I don't regret the purchase at all. The hype is well-deserved.\n\nSo tonight's shave is brought to you by the letter 'S.' For Sunset, for 6S, and for smooth as butter. I've never been able to really shave my neck/chin ATG, but tonight I fearlessly did so, and got really good results despite a couple of minor nicks (not the \"Oh fuck I've butchered myself\" ones I usually do when attempting such madness). I picked the R4 plate based on it looking like a fairly similar blade gap to that of the V3A. I don't know what it is about the 6S's head design, but it's fantastically smooth. It holds my blade really rigid, which was one of my only issues with the V3A is it seemed to have more chatter than other razors like my slants. By far the best shave I've had so far. Sunset is a fantastic performer, and I really really like their pre/post shave splash as well. Never knew I could grow to love vetiver until I tried this scent. Happy shaving guys!",

I'd never buy the aftershave on its own - doesn't do much for the skin, and doesn't justify the cost. However, it does smell great, and makes for a nice pairing with so many soaps (as does the very safe, clean EdT of course).",

It definitely checks all the boxes regarding performance; protection / cushion, slickness, post-shave feel. I had no problems building a great lather, and the soap can handle a good amount of water, resulting in a thick, dense, heavy, creamy, luxurious lather. Excellent shave.\n\nThe scent is also very well crafted, and scent strength is on the higher end of medium, great off the dry soap, great while lathering, and very present throughout the shave. The splash matches seamlessly, and has great longevity. To me, the scent is very woody and musky, but in a masculine cologne kind of way. It is rich and deep without being cloying or in-your-face overpowering. It is different from anything else I have smelled, and I like it.\n\nOverall, color me impressed. Thanks to my man and big-time Dr. Jon's supporter, /u/ketchuegrast, for facilitating the acquisition of these fine products. I will certainly be enjoying the *13* soap and splash in my den.\n\nEnjoy your shave, and your day.",

I decided to try a milder setting considering my growth was so little, I did a 7/4/2 shave, 7 being with the grain, 4 being across the grain, and the 2 being against the grain. I just decided that I really need to use a number one setting on the against the grain pass for a comfortable shave. That said, this is the first razor I've used that has had no irritation against the grain.\n\nOverall I found that I had very little irritation. I might consider doing it next time on such little growth, but, overall, this resulted in a BBS shave.\n\nIn other news, I used Night Music because I decide I want to have something a little special this morning. Those of you who have never used it before and got it on the prebuy are really in for a treat. This is one of the best scents that I know.\n\nHave a great Wednesday!\n",

The Dark scent is very interesting, I got mostly vetiver and cocoa occasionally smelling the coffee and after passes would get a small amount of cooling that I can only assume is the peppermint.\n\nThe splash smells a bit different than the soap, but I couldn't tell why or if some of the ingredients in the splash themselves had something to do with that. It did leave my face feeling pretty moisturized so good marks there.\n\nGirlfriend has been doing better, doctors never seemed to concerned with the fainting but she's going to take it easy for a while as a precaution. She is now trying to take supplements for some vitamins that her body hadn't been getting. After today we'll be 20 days into the whole30 diet, definitely lost some weight so far.",

I had initially gotten help from the other sub in replacing my poor choices for my first setup, but as I kept reading and learning, I found my way over here, where I felt much more connected. Before long, my mornings started off by scouring the daily SOTD threads and looking up and researching all the various things people were using. Aside from the fact that there is a lot of high end gear being used, I also noticed a large population of people using badger brushes. Slowly I started coming around to the idea that the Perfecto was not a good example to base my decisions on, and started contemplating trying out something else.\n\nWhile I was seeing plenty of high end brushes, or hard to obtain knots in the threads, I wasn't ready to make that big jump yet, so I was spending some time researching, trying to find an inexpensive entry point to badger brushes that would still give me a good experience. For a short period, I had been close to picking up a Frank Shaving finest, but had some concerns about getting a bad knot or a shedder. About this same period, /u/stirlingsoap, had put out his first 24mm finest, and the good reviews were just starting to roll in. At just over half the cost of the similar Frank I had been looking at, and with the positive feedback coming in left and right, I decided to pick one up, while they were still at their introductory sale price.\n\nI was so excited when it first arrived, and I couldn't wait to use it for the first time. There was only the mildest funky smell, so I figured it would go away naturally with a couple of uses, and I set it out for the following morning's shave.\n\nI woke up extra early, and practically rushed to the bathroom to get my morning routine started. By this point I was knocking out great lathers with the synthetics, so I jumped in with both feet and started making up my first lather with the new brush. It did not go well. Somehow the lather was too pasty and too watery all at the same time, and there wasn't enough of it. I finished two passes, and there wasn't enough releasing for a third pass, so I did what I had been doing with the synthetics, and squeezed up the lather from the bristles to get it out for the last pass. That's when the nasty brown sludge funk came out, and I learned about cleaning and rinsing a new brush before using it. There was no third pass that day.\n\nDespite that poor showing, one great thing happened during that first shave, I felt the wonderful touch of badger hair for the first time. The lather was poor, but the firm massaging action on my face was so great I knew it would work itself out. I didn't know it at the time, but I was first experiencing real backbone on a brush. Sure enough, three or four shaves later, between the knot breaking in, and me altering my lathering technique, the great lathers started coming and I was rewarded with yet another new great experience to add to my daily shaves.\n\nFinal verdict is that this is a great brush. I've since picked up some higher-end brushes, but this one still makes into my regular rotation because it competes lather for lather with them. It's an unbelievably good value. If I had to go back and order a replacement now, I'd probably get the black 26mm with the bigger knot and lower loft, but the original 24 is still a great brush, and there's a good reason it has gotten such universally postive feedback from the people using it.\n\n\n\nHave a good one!\n\n\n\n**Brushes**\n\n[<< Maggard Razor, 24mm Synthetic, Marble Handle](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5oh2kf/tuesday_sotd_thread_jan_17_2017/dcjekzj/)\n\n[Paladin Shaving 26mm Select, Jade Lotus Handle >>](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5ovlic/thursday_sotd_thread_jan_19_2017/dcmixfi/)\n****\n\n**Tours**\n\n[Razor Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5lefc9/happy_new_year_sotd_thread_jan_01_2017/dbv6f4p/)\n\n[Brush Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5o322q/sunday_sotd_thread_jan_15_2017/dcgf5ud/)\n\n[Soap Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5q99m5/thursday_sotd_thread_jan_26_2017/dcxird1/)",

Very impressed again, same dark notes of leather, rubber, gun oil, smoke. It definitely takes a special pallate to appreciate it, but I enjoyed it immensely. Very easy lather, I was surprised by how much I got.\n\nThe Mergress was, for lack of a better term, phenomenal. This was my first time trying it and I'm already in love. Very smooth, excellent weight and balance, and the feel was outstanding. I used a setting of 3 and was impressed at how close just one pass got. I honestly only needed the third pass to get a couple small spots. I think a few more shaves with it and I'll have it locked in. Excellent razor, I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for an adjustable.\n\nAnyone who knows me knows I am a sucker for all things Stirling. From the very first time I tried their products and every time after I have been outstandingly pleased. The bay rum aftershave balm gave the darkness of the Chiseled Face a nice smooth spiciness, excellent pairing.\n\nVery pleased with this morning, face feels amazing, Id rank today in my top 10 favorite shaves.",

Incredibly excited to try it out.\n\nAlso, I'm planning on doing a reknot with either my Wolf Whiskers brush or this LoveYourShave brush, and I'm thinking about doing an Elite knot. Both brushes are drilled to 26mm for TGN knots, will that correlate to a 26mm Elite Manchurian? Or a 24mm?\n\nEdit: Just finished up the shave, the new formula is seriously good stuff. I don't know how much better it is than the V2 or Oliva , but it's definitely solid. One of the easiest lathers I've whipped up, and the scent is killer. Woody, spicy citrus off the puck, but the citrus note gets even stronger after lathering (smells kinda like Froot Loops too, actually). I'm definitely going to want to get a few more shaves in with this setup, but the first impression so far is great.\n\nEdit 2: Revisiting it and I'm getting a lot of pine notes too. This one is a winner for me.",

It's going to be a welcome break after working nearly every waking hour most days for the past four months or so.\n\nOn to the soap: the scent was made for Special Reserve and it goes together splendidly. I knew as soon as I lathered what I was using, which was cool, because I have been neglecting this aftershave. Luckily the Booster made it winter-compatible.\n\nLastly, I was in a hurry and wanted a close shave. Luckily u/Angry_Cardboard_Box has inspired a sort of H2 renaissance (aka I put it on the handle and that means I'll be too lazy to change the head for a while). It did the job admirably and I was on time and smooth-faced.\n\nEdit: [Image](http://i.imgur.com/ejG3AMU.jpg)",

When I first started coming around here, the preorder for Hallows had just begun, and holy crap did this stuff sound good. The problem was that I didn't have any extra cash to drop on soap tubs, and $25 seemed insane for soap. After all, it's just crap that you stick on your face, right? With this moronic mindset, I let the preorder slip by, and then I watched as this soap later sold out almost instantly through Maggard's site.\n\nFast forward to Christmas, when Amazon was the only retailer still carrying Hallows. I threw it on my wishlist as a hail mary, and I told my wife that it would be cool to get, especially since it was the first limited edition soap that ever caught my eye. My wife took the hint, and she came in clutch. This soap is seriously top-notch, and I have no idea how a scent so wonderful can be polarizing in any way. Honestly, the only issue I have with this soap is that I am an idiot and missed out on the matching A/S. Oh well- that can be my holy grail for next time.\n\nEnjoy your day, you hooligans.\n",

Smells nice, though the post shave feel isn't as moisturizing as glissant or bison tallow.\n\nAlso picked up some new frag samples off Reddit /r/fragranceswap. This one is touted as being \"work friendly\". Paging /u/jdubba to confirm.\n\nEverything about today's shave and frag reminds me of a warmer summer day. That's what I like to remember as I go into day 2 of 3 of a tough work week. Happy Hump day y'all!",

Today's candidate is the I2 *Hydro-Magic* model. This model is my 2nd favorite (of the ones that I've used), and today's razor is actually the 2nd I2 that I own. The I2 has never given me bad shave with a Chinese Schick blade, and that record stands with the new Personna blade that I popped into this one today.\n\nEasy 2-pass BBS, today. I think I have this FS Finest dialed in, too. Yesterday and Monday, my lathers were good, but the extra lather I squeezed out of the brush at the end of my shave was just a bit on the dry side. Today, I adjusted the amount of water the brush was holding, and the extra lather was perfect at the end. Good times.\n\nHappy Hump Day, all. I gotta go to the funeral home this evening after work. That should be fun (said no one ever).",

I've tried Nacet stainless blades before and don't really think they're for me. I do like the gator on the pack though. First shave with a L6 I picked up; $7 shipped all the way from Lithuania. Blasphemously tickled to have a brush that says LORD on it. Gifted one a while back to a friend as his first DE. He seems to enjoy it. The razor shaved pretty well. Mild, similar to a Gillette Tech or Merkur 23c. Stoked to try it with a Feather as it's a favorite in my Tech. Paul H of PaulHFilms likes his L6. I seem to enjoy a lot of the razors he uses.\n\nMy stubble can irritate my face a little as it gets longer. I think that factor made this a rough shave. It was also a before work shave; irritation under my neck. No fragrance or aftershave today. Leviathan scent lingered well into the day. Lady friend said it smelled nice. Probably the strongest smelling soap I have. Coffee gives it a little bit of a gourmand vibe; creamy; a hint of sweetness; smokey leather.\n\nDon't take no guff ladies and gents!",

The R1 from my first shave seems to be a pretty efficient and kinda comfortable razor. It's light (which I love) due to the aluminum construction and the color scheme is nice - the blue baseplate is a cool touch. I did get a bit of blade feel from it, which is a stark difference from my Alumigoose, FB tech, and Canadian Prewar Tech. It feels more along the lines of my Slim Adjustable at ~5. I'll try it with a different blade tonight and see if it feels any smoother, but it's definitely on my list! Maybe a M1 might be better for me.\nI had high hopes for CRSW Select V2, but at least from first lather, it seemed to lack heavily in residual slickness. I didn't feel as comfortable blade buffing and my face felt dry after each pass. It could also be the razor, but based on my initial experiences, the Oliva base is better IMO, though that doesn't matter since they have a new base anyway. I'll be sticking with my other artisans anyway :)",

Having used Puzzle a good bit I *know* I need another full tub of his bison tallow formula, but I'm not sure yet which scent I want most. Cuir et Epices is very nice, though maybe a bit fruity for regular use for my tastes. Trismegistus may have just moved into the lead for me. Very clean, very pleasant, and 'simple' enough to use regularly. Simple meaning not exactly challenging, even though it's still complex and more than the sum of its parts.",

There is something in the Dark that smells a bit medicinal I guess would be the word I'd use that kind of throws me off a bit. Not sure what it is, could be the benzoin as I was told that it is a muted cream soday/vanilla scent, but again not sure.\n\nThe splash scent strength is not very strong and gets overpowered by an ingredient in the splash or maybe partially that scent but it smells quite different. All is forgiven because of how the splash makes your skin feel afterwards.",

I hadn't been looking long or really trying to understand exactly what I wanted, when I saw a post about Paladin doing a brush release that afternoon. I went over and browsed through the photos of the brushes that were up for release, and saw they had some jade handles, which is something I was really interested in. I loved the lotus style, and it seemed to be well suited for the jade handle stock, so I decided if I could get this particular brush, I'd do it. Well, I got lucky and clicked through fast enough and managed to snag this one.\n\nFirm and scrubby, with soft tips. I gave it a couple of test lathers to clean it out and flush out the brown funk, and then put it to use. No problems building great lather straight away, and here's the secret why. It is very highly similar to the Stirling brush. It's a tad denser, has a tad more backbone, and is slightly larger, but otherwise feels and performs almost exactly the same as the Stirling's finest. There was no learning curve, because the Stirling had already provided it.\n\nAesthetically this a beautiful brush. The quality of the handle is very nice, and you can tell a lot of attention to detail went into the design and execution of creating it. The shape on this one suits my hand very well also, making it very comfortable to use. The knots are well selected, comfortable, with easy load and lather building. I've had a good enough experience with this one, that I can easily see adding another sometime in my future. I'd like to have something with the 28mm version of this knot at some point, and the handles are finely crafted.\n\n\n\nHave a good one!\n\n\n\n**Brushes**\n\n[<< Stirling Soap Co. 24mm Finest, Ivory Handle](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5oocvd/wednesday_sotd_thread_jan_18_2017/dckxm23/)\n\n[Omega S100049 S-Brush, Pro Synthetic Boar >>](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5p2wj7/friday_sotd_thread_jan_20_2017/dco6up1/)\n****\n\n**Tours**\n\n[Razor Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5lefc9/happy_new_year_sotd_thread_jan_01_2017/dbv6f4p/)\n\n[Brush Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5o322q/sunday_sotd_thread_jan_15_2017/dcgf5ud/)\n\n[Soap Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5q99m5/thursday_sotd_thread_jan_26_2017/dcxird1/)",

God this razor is amazing.\n\nReally liked the Harmony both for performance and scent. The samples are a bit small which makes it harder to load on a brush, but once I got the lather going I found it to be slick and with a great face feel. The scent made it seem like I was shaving with a stick of Nag Champa, too.",

I have only use this razor three times before and never really cared for it. I don't know what changed, but I actually enjoyed using it and it gave me a great comfortable shave. More comfortable than my E2 that I used yesterday. That tells me two things. One: I didn't give the G6 a fair chance before today. Two: Maybe I need to change the blade in my E2. I got such a nice shave that I think I'll be taking the G6 with me on my upcoming road trip. Gotta go to work now.",

I don't think I can get in the less than 5 minutes range as some can, but I did get it to pretty much 10 minutes. I just spend a few minutes alone building a good lather. I think I enjoy it too much to \"race through it\". Like all things wet shaving related, there is absolutely nothing wrong with a 3-5 minute shave compared to a 30 minutes shave. As long as you enjoy the experience, that 's what counts. I probably spent a total of 15-16 minutes counting clean-up. Which for me, really means clean-up! Sink is spotless. So my lesson was I can go from a total time of ±25 minutes and bring that down to a more reasonable 15 minutes without feeling rushed. Thanks again to all who offered tips and suggestions. Oh yeah, no nicks, weepers or irritation at all! :-) This morning's shave was awesome because of *Bandit*. Great Thursday shaves to all.\n\nPS. Yes, I already reserved my ticket for the 13-MAY-17 Maggard Razors meet-up.\nI hope to be wearing my best bitter scowl. Because ANGER.",

Changed the blade in it and put the old Polsilver in the FB tech to use as a control (ooo science). The Calypso fared much better with the Super Platinums (Blacks), but was still a touch more harsh than the RB tech (so at least I know it wasn't a bum Polsilver). That said, it was also more efficient than the tech. I'll be continuing to use the Calypso and see if I can get it even more comfortable as I get more used to it, but if it doesn't take a Polsilver, I'm probably not going to buy one myself haha. Maybe the M1 will fare better..",

Since I have some time off I thought I would finally see how it does. I don't know if it's because it was in that sample \"tin\" for who knows how long but there's hardly a scent. However, the performance was just fine - not bad but not great. 3/5 Regarding the after shave lotion, I'm not a fan. There's more scent but it was too thick and greasy. 1/5",

I've been shaving this way for over a little a year. I recently reached the point where i no longer cut myself. But i can never get under 20-30 minutes.\n\nIm not complaining. I love taking my time.

My son woke up early, this morning, so I was unable to shave at my regularly scheduled time.\n\nBut, it's /u/Sammy_Lee's birthday! I couldn't just skip it! So I also changed my normal setup for today to commemorate the occasion.\n\n*Ruby's Green* is the only full set of Mickey Lee that I have, so I figured I'd go with that tonight. It was PIF'd to me by a fellow wet shaver, so I felt it fitting to use it to honor someone as generous as its creator. This scent is fantastic. Smelling summer is a great way to forget for a handful of minutes this nasty, gray January day.\n\nI had a conversation the other day in another thread about how Mickey Lee's aftershaves don't get the love that they deserve, and I'd like to reiterate that here. The *Ruby's Green* splash is fantastic, and has me feeling and smelling great as I get ready to (hopefully) head to bed, here.\n\nThe K1 is a fantastic lady, which is yet another good way to share this shave. It was my first use of the razor, and it gave me an effortless 2-pass BBS.\n\nGood way to end the day. Happy Birthday, Sammy!",

The captain pink blade did not work with this razor at all. First pass and it was tugging. So completed the first pass and switched to the ATT AL R1. Have a blade sampler coming from tryablade so I'm not too worried about not liking the general. As for the soap, I purchased this late last summer and had forgotten about it. The scent is interesting to say the least, not sure what my nose was detecting but definetly felt like there was some menthol in there. I don't know how you guys used these huge tins, first time using this soap and I was getting pissed at the soap getting all over the sides. Couldn't grip the damn thing. Anyways, have a great shave everyone!",

I thought I owed it to myself to try one out. I looked around and decided to go with the 100049. Inexpensive, decent sized, and wouldn't have the extra-long break in time of the Semogues.\n\nI got home from work on a Friday night and the brush had arrived. I got it out, and it looked and felt nothing like what I was expecting. That's when I noticed the S in the brush model number. It was only on the bottom of the brush package. Looked like a very easy mistake to make. I contacted Maggard Razors via e-mail and there was a new package on my doorstep by 10:00 am Monday morning. I swear, they have some compromising videos of the Post Master General or something. At any rate, part of their excellent customer service response, was telling me to just keep the S-Brush as well.\n\nIn terms of usage, I've never gotten a great lather out of this one. To be fair, I've only tried it a handful of times, but I just haven't figured out the trick with it. Like my other synthetics, the fiber tips are very soft. But this one is the springiest of all the synthetics I own. It just doesn't want to splay, and when it gives, it just completely flops over all the way at the base. It's stiff and floppy all at the same time, which is just an odd combination, and in a worst of both worlds sort of way. I don't know if it's the fact that it's just an older style of synthetic fiber, or if it's because of the way its set and lofted to mimic the look of their larger boar knots. I think this one would probably work best as a bowl lather brush though, because of the odd splay characteristics.\n\nGoing in with a little history, I got a manageable face lather, just enough for a three pass shave. Once the lather is built, it releases it well enough. It's a usable brush, but not one I find myself wanting to reach for.\n\n\n\nHave a good one!\n\n\n\n**Brushes**\n\n[<< Paladin Shaving 26mm Select Badger, Jade Lotus Handle](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5ovlic/thursday_sotd_thread_jan_19_2017/dcmixfi/)\n\n[Omega 10049, Professional Boar >>](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5p9tbq/saturday_sotd_thread_jan_21_2017/dcpo25s/)\n****\n\n**Tours**\n\n[Razor Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5lefc9/happy_new_year_sotd_thread_jan_01_2017/dbv6f4p/)\n\n[Brush Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5o322q/sunday_sotd_thread_jan_15_2017/dcgf5ud/)\n\n[Soap Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5q99m5/thursday_sotd_thread_jan_26_2017/dcxird1/)",

I acquired two days ago from my boss and again I have yet to be dissapointed with a Stirling product, this soap is no exception.\n\nThe brush was the new addition to the rotation, I purchased it a few days ago on Amazon do this was the first run. The handle was solid, the metal base makes for a nice weight and feel. The knot was well formed, very soft with the synthetic bristles but had a nice backbone. Loaded very well, I don't think I lost even one fiber, though normally losing some during the break in is expected. Excellent product, I would recommend this brush for anyone looking to add a synthetic badger top their collection.\n\nThe razor and aftershave is all pretty standard fare in my rotation, the Nivea is a good unscented balm, and of course, the Clubman is a classic.\n\n[New Brush!](http://i.imgur.com/SHLYUBR.jpg)",

At the time, I gave it a 3.5/5; good, but not a 1 seed for me at the time. Now that my nose has developed a little bit (although still awful, as evidence by the Puzzle contest), I appreciate the intricacies of Lavanille much, much more, and would now give it much closer to 4.25-4.5. I paired it with Bon Vivant based on /u/hawns recommendation on his site (shared Vanilla note), and am pleased with the crossover.\n\n\n",

High tide at 6:33 this evening.\n\nGreat performance from Dapper Dragon. If I have a sample that doesn't have a matching splash with it, I usually try to look up the notes to find a splash that will go well with it. That didn't happen this morning, so I just went something I thought would compliment it nicely. While Dickens does compliment Tiamat well, there is a little bit of discord with the citrus from Dickens. Overall pleasant shave, Dapper Dragon never seems to disappoint.\n\nHave a nice Saturday!",

Man was it stiff and uncomfortable. I read up and spent a few weeks doing daily lathers and letting it dry out in between, to break it in. When I came back to actually use it again, it was much better.\n\nI don't think I'll ever be a boar guy. Maybe if I had started there and really worked with them for a long time, but I found badgers first, and like the softer, pillowy scrub they provide. The boar, even now that it is broken in decently, and has tons of split ends, feels a touch too rough for me to use every day. They really make a great change of pace for an occasional shave though, and I could even see at some point trying other knots and longer runs to really master working with one.\n\n\n\nHave a good one!\n\n\n\n**Brushes**\n\n[<< Omega S10049 S-Brush, Pro Synthetic Boar](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5p2wj7/friday_sotd_thread_jan_20_2017/dco6up1/)\n\n[Declaration Brushworks, The Franklin #7 >>](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5pg3t8/sunday_sotd_thread_jan_22_2017/dcr4g4m/)\n****\n\n**Tours**\n\n[Razor Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5lefc9/happy_new_year_sotd_thread_jan_01_2017/dbv6f4p/)\n\n[Brush Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5o322q/sunday_sotd_thread_jan_15_2017/dcgf5ud/)\n\n[Soap Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5q99m5/thursday_sotd_thread_jan_26_2017/dcxird1/)",

There is little blade exposure on this razor so it is abundantly clear to me that its prowess in cleaning up the nastiest places I have to shave isn't due to some wild-eyed blade exposure but rather the stiffness of the blade in torsion. End of the slant conversation for me.\n\nBeautiful shave from beautiful products and gear.\n\n\n",

Three passes, BBS except for the slightest hint of stubble in two tiny spots on the jaw line.\n\nNow I want to revisit a Feather in the V3A and see how I do there. I'm beginning to suspect more and more that it's not so much that blades are YMMV but that my technique sucked before. I never could get a bloodless shave from that combo months ago so I look forward to testing this out.",

Smaller then what I prefer but it's a work of art. He also sent me half a tub of the Vetiver. Thanks again my man!!! Damn I love some MdC. This is just a really nice light Vetiver scent. Not to dirty or anything. First go with the razor and so far impressed. Will do a bigger write up after a week or so",

I drove 800 miles yesterday and had to make do with what was available along the way. While stopped in a rest area, I rummaged through a trash can and found my gear for my shave. I located a half eaten sandwich with an unidentifiable meat on it. The mayo served as my lather. The bread was my brush. This didn't work too well, but beggars can't be choosers.\n\nI saw an empty beer can in the trash can and luckily it was not damaged. I managed to tear it open and get a nice clean and straight section to use as my razor. Now, torn beer cans are great for slicing the hell out of your fingers, but they ain't worth shit for shaving. I did the best I could with it. I grabbed a half full bottle of Diet Pepsi to use as my aftershave. It was less than satisfying. Once I get to my destination, I'll have a proper shave. Good day to all.",

      "body": "###[Brush-Tour: Declaration Brushworks, The Franklin #7](http://imgur.com/a/T7sfk)\n****\n\n* **Prep**: Stirling Soap Co. - *Gatlinburg*\n* **Razor**: Maggard Razors - *V3A on MR11*\n* **Blade**: Gillette - *7 O'Clock Super Platinum* (8)\n* **Brush**: Declaration Brushworks - *The Franklin* #7\n* **Lather**: Tallow + Steel/Chatillon Lux - *Yuzu/Rose/Patchouli*\n* **Splash**: Thayers - *Original Witch Hazel with Aloe Vera*\n* **Balm**: Chatillon Lux - *Yuzu/Rose/Patchouli*\n* **Frag**: Rasasi - *Daarej*\n\n****\n\n\n\nWe've finally reached the apex of the brush tour. I've missed this brush so much, and looked forward to this particular shave for quite some time. I chose not to use this brush for the razor tour, because it is so large, and so dense, it just can't dry out thoroughly in 24 hours, and I didn't want to leave it in a perpetual wet state for that many days in a row. Obviously, I couldn't use it for every shave of the brush tour, because well, then it wouldn't be a brush tour.\n\nAs soon as I saw the Declaration Brushworks release, I knew I wanted to try one of Scott's brushes. I was checking the site every 30 minutes or so when I could, but I missed the first couple of batches that came out. I hated things like heading out to lunch, because I was afraid I'd miss a release. As much as I checked, I still managed to miss the earliest batches that came up. So, I sat down and threw together a quick PS script to check the site every 60 seconds, and pop a browser open straight to The Franklin page as soon as there was stock available. A couple of days later I was in the middle of something else, and BAM! there was a new browser window with an Add to Cart button practically smiling at me, so I quick clicked through the checkout, and #7 was headed my way.\n\nThe handle of this thing is beautiful. Pictures don't quite capture the nature of the resin. It comes off somewhat flat in pictures, but has a certain depth that is very much understated elegance when holding it. It also has a different, softer texture when gripping. The knot is extremely dense. The fibers are not stiff, so the backbone of the brush seems to come from fiber density. The tips are soft and gooey. It has an extremely luxurious feel when face lathering. The only downside to this brush, is that the density means that it doesn't release lather as efficiently as my other brushes, but it's a small tradeoff for that wonderful, pillowy lather experience.\n\nUnlike some other reports I've seen, mine did shed a little at first. I probably lost 20-30 hairs the first couple of shaves, and for a few uses after that I would lose a hair or two here and there. After that though, it settled in and hasn't lost any more in quite some time. This is not surprising to me as the hair density on this brush is so high. Just throwing this out in case anyone else picks one up and loses some hairs up front. Have no fear, it will settle in.\n\nThe final verdict is that as it currently stands, this is my favorite brush. If I had to go down to one, it would be this one. The size and characteristics make for a wonderful lather building experience. It's soft tipped, but firm and massaging, and has no problem building tons of rich creamy lather. It could release a tad better, but to do that the density would have to go down, and I think it would lose some of the great face feel which is what gives it its charm. Congrats /u/landlgrooming, you've done something quite excellent with Declaration Brushworks, and I'm sure this won't be my last Declaration Brushworks brush.\n\n\n\nHave a good one!\n\n\n\n**Brushes**\n\n[<< Omega 10049, Professional Boar](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5p9tbq/saturday_sotd_thread_jan_21_2017/dcpo25s/)\n\n[Stirling Soap Co., 24mm Finest Fan, Butterscotch Handle >>](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5pnjtn/monday_sotd_thread_jan_23_2017/dcsj4yb/)\n****\n\n**Tours**\n\n[Razor Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5lefc9/happy_new_year_sotd_thread_jan_01_2017/dbv6f4p/)\n\n[Brush Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5o322q/sunday_sotd_thread_jan_15_2017/dcgf5ud/)\n\n[Soap Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5q99m5/thursday_sotd_thread_jan_26_2017/dcxird1/)",

Last night was the 13th use of this blade and while it has definitely dulled in comparison to the first use it still gives comfortable results. It reminds me of a Derby blade in that it might tug a little bit in some areas but overall gives a close, comfortable shave without any issues.\n\nThe warm burning sensation from the aftershave has seemed to die down a little as well. It now only lasts about ten minutes but my face does feel slightly numb during that time so I'm not sure if that's from the sensation and my brain just blocking it out or if there's a bigger problem.",

I had been maintaining a full beard basically since I could grow one, because I just hated my experiences shaving with electric or cartridge razors. I bought a DE Starter Kit from Maggard, intending to just use it to shave my neck and cheeks. Within 2 weeks, I had gone down to a goatee for the first time in years! This hobby is proving to be a lot of fun - I love all the scents and how the lather feels and everything.\n\nI like the Tea Tree soap from Stirling - I went a little crazy and bought like 20+ samples from them after trying a couple of their soaps. I'm kinda trying to burn through this one to get to some of the more interesting smelling ones.\n\nI skipped yesterday, so I had about 2.5 days' worth of growth. I found the Big Ben blade to be really tuggy on the first pass, but decently smooth after it knocked down most of the growth.\n\nI'm loving CL's aftershaves. They make my skin feel so great, and they smell amazing. The gf hasn't quite come around to most of their scents....but she'll get there lol.\n\nI've gotten shaving my face down, but am still working on the neck. It feels pretty good today, but I've experienced a decent bit of irritation in the past. And then I get visible red bumps which are very stubborn and don't want to go away. I think my issue is trying to go WTG on my neck, as the hair goes almost straight sideways. The awkward angle was forcing me to use more pressure/making it harder to maintain a proper angle. Today I just did one pass XTG in each direction, so hoping that allowed me to maintain less pressure. We'll see how it feels in a few hours!",

Set the knot last night. Prefect amount of backbone and splays easily enough. Does Not hold onto the lather like my bigger brushes, it's just perfect, I love it :).\n\nThe soap smells wonderful. I didn't know this is what old spice smelled like, otherwise I would of been wearing it a long time ago :). I don't know how exact of a match it is, since I don't think I've smelled the original.\n\nThe only reason I tried this brand of soap is because /u/Flawman778 sent me a sample of some of their soap, along with a trade that we did and I was very impressed by the performance. Then I saw the post in the deals thread, that they made one with goats milk, so I got this one and I really like it.",

We had a blast, but I'm glad to have a day of peace and quiet today. Socializing like that takes a lot out of me, and I need a day to recover.\n\nToday was the first chance I had to use the AP Shave Co *Cashmere* knot, and my first impression of it is very favorable. Its fibers remind me of the black synthetic \"Game Changer\" although I think it holds water a bit differently. Still, it's very comfortable and a great performer. Not sure if I like it better than his *Tuxedo* knots yet, but I definitely like it quite a lot. The handle from /u/G_huck is nothing short of beautiful. It's also quite comfortable in the hand, and a pleasure to use: Functional artwork.\n\nHave a great Sunday, everyone.\n\n\n\n-----\n\n**EDIT:** *Incorrect date.*",

None of my other brushes are fans, and I wanted to get an idea of how they would differ from a bulb brush. Plus I loved the bright orange take on butterscotch.\n\nThe hair on this brush is about the same as the bulbs. It's very soft tipped, and gets that gooy gel look when wet. Just like its counterpart, it is also extremely comfortable to use, in fact it is even more gentle on the face. In the end, I think that is why I still prefer the bulb, it is just a bit more scrubby than the fan. Due to the shape is splays very easily. It's not floppy, but it's just not as firm as the bulb. I think this lessens the backbone and attributes to the more gentle face feel.\n\nOne thing this brush does better than the bulb though is lather release. Once you have it worked up, it flows and paints on to the face very effeciently. Based on this, and the slightly longer handle shape, this brush is just about perfect if you are going to be bowl lathering. I normally don't do this with full tubs, but I load and build sample lathers in a bowl, so this has turned into my sample brush.\n\nFinal verdict is that this is a good brush. It doesn't necessarily suit my style, or the preference for mildly scrubby brushes that I've developed. If you're looking for something that is slighly more gentle on the face though, or have a preference for bowl lathering, this one might suit you perfectly. Fortunately for me, it is very comfortable, and fills in as a good role player in the sample department.\n\n\n\nHave a good one!\n\n\n\n**Brushes**\n\n[<< Declaration Brushworks, The Franklin #7](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5pg3t8/sunday_sotd_thread_jan_22_2017/dcr4g4m/)\n\n[Omega, 20102 Professional Boar >>](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5q287y/wednesday_sotd_thread_jan_25_2017/dcvu2zu/)\n****\n\n**Tours**\n\n[Razor Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5lefc9/happy_new_year_sotd_thread_jan_01_2017/dbv6f4p/)\n\n[Brush Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5o322q/sunday_sotd_thread_jan_15_2017/dcgf5ud/)\n\n[Soap Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5q99m5/thursday_sotd_thread_jan_26_2017/dcxird1/)",

However, I had a little irritation from the Belmont Deluxe yesterday. I think the aggressive razor combined with the Feather blade was simply too much for my delicate face. Anyways, the Slim on #3 worked surprisingly well, maybe I'll stick with it all week,choices, choices, choices. Just think, some folks don't have these issues, they shave with the same damn thing everyday. It's stressful deciding what to use, ha-ha!\n\n",

I'll shave at night when I have to, but I just prefer shaving in the morning. The uber soft motel water is making things interesting. Lather is flying everywhere. I was afraid that my lather might get too thin as a result, but that was a misplaced fear. Sherlock performed great with the Mühle brush. And this razor is really turning out to be a big surprise. It's much more comfortable than I had remembered it being. I'm glad I chose to bring it with me.\n\nWe spent the afternoon and evening spoiling the hell out of our grandson. We were a little concerned that he would be shy around us, but as soon as he saw us he knew who we were (thank you Skype). He turns 2 this week and is beginning to speak. It's such a kick to hear him say \"Hi Papaw\". Today will be more of the same.",

If anyone is ever having trouble making a lather and it's consistency I cannot recommend using a cream any higher.",

SO and I were driving back to our apartment during the storm, and our phones went off telling us about the tornado warning. There's no shelter around us so we have to push on for a bit. Not even a minute later and the wind starts spiraling right the fuck on top of us, debris is hitting my windshield, and the rain is so intense that I can literally only see white on one side of the car. Couldn't get to the shelter we had originally planned on because we would have had to drive through that. Thankfully we were able to turn off that road and head to the local museum's storm shelter. Fucking hell though, I can only think of a couple of times I've ever been that scared.",

Yeah, I got it today, because fucking around doesn't seem to be in Rod's wheelhouse. He was also generous enough to throw in a sample of the matching balm.\n\nThis was a blind buy for me, and a happy one at that. Definitely going to have to grab a bottle of that balm.\n\nAny Arkadia fans here that noticed a change in the scent profile? The last one I had, there was more of an emphasis on the orange/citrus notes on the front end, whereas, the balm and soap I just got has more of an emphasis on the wood/mineral/geranium notes, and not so much on the citrus. Still great, just different.\n",

This time I remembered the latter. Let me assure you lather makes a huge difference. That said, I have to agree with those who have said the Clog Pruf is the best micromatic out there. I would usually shy away from using my open comb micromatic after I shaved within the past 24 hours. However, I decided to go for it today, I got a really good shave. Very little irritation.\n\nI still prefer, and I am in love with, the slim, because of its ability to become more mild as I move through passes resulting in no irritation. But, that said, it's a very nice razor. I think it replaces the OCMM as my third favorite razor (the Hydro magic being my second favorite one).\n\nI'm also starting to wonder if riding the safety bar is making a big difference I'm considering revisiting some of my other razors to see if riding safety bar would make a difference with them. I've been doing that lately, really has seem to make a major difference in my shaves.",

The lather, which was gray, threw me for a loop since this is the first soap I've used that has activated charcoal as an ingredient. Did a 10 second load and had enough soap for more than 3 passes, although I only did 2. The scent off the puck starts off with a floral lavender, which I prefer to the spicy lavender, and then the sweet lemon starts to come in and take over the party. I would say the scent strength is about medium off the puck and dies down once lathered. Once applied to the face, the lemon seems to take over and scent strength dips down to a mid-low range. The performance of the soap reminds me of Stirling, although I would still rank Stirling higher. Good slickness, good cushion, good post shave and easy to load. As for the balm, its more of a witch hazel aftershave then a balm. I'm not sure I like the balm however. I don't know what scent is coming out, but it's definitely not lemon lavender. It's either the witch hazel or the the Kukui Nut oil that I get as the scent which kind of disappoints me. Applies and dries up quickly. Whatever scent I got from the balm, dissipated quickly and an hour after shaving, I get no scent at all. Overall, I really like the soap and I would probably pass on the balm if I had to order again. Have a great shave everyone!",

It felt strange after using the injector for two weeks but the only real issue that I had was on my ATG pass because I find that DE blades like to skip around on me. I think I'll give each razor two days due to the fact that I only have 4.\n\nI hope everyone has good shaves today!",

That awesome dude sent me a few bars of his bath soap, one of which I have been using for two days and really loving. It didn't seem to be maybe as thick of a lather as I expected, but it works well and my skin feels amazing, so...results.\n\nSpeaking of lather not being the thickness I expected, when I lathered the soap, it looked shiny as fuck but seemed a bit thick. His previous formula did the same thing, and the first pass was probably still a little dry. At the same time, it worked impeccably. So I left my face dripping and did the second pass and that shit was magic. The menthol was probably around Arctique level, about the threshold of my tolerance. The slickness was off the charts, also, and had a nice minty melange to go with the menthol. Kept the menthol going with Catie's Bubbles most outstanding aftershave that has a nice menthol kick.\n\nAnyway, thanks Mr. Bungle! All of this soap is magical.",

Harris Windsor AS Splash\n\nMonday is R41 day, but this week it was ruined by a Tiger blade (the carbon steel ones, I think? from the Czech Republic) - I've never had to swap blades mid-shave before, but there was no way I was letting that thing anywhere near my neck. So, after that disaster, I came back to the R41 this morning, and it got me as reliably silky-smooth as ever.",

This thing is beautiful, and very light!! The Kai mild blades were Ok. Too mild for me I think. I ended up with a couple of nicks. I'll still give it a few more shaves before switching over to the next blade.\n\nHappy Tuesday everyone!\n",

Sacrilege. However, I wanted to use it to check my technique. I expected the shave to be total garbage but it wound up being really good. Not injector good but definitely on par with my DEs. One pass left me hardly able to feel any stubble WTG over most of my head; there's a small row of hair on the back I missed and a small patch on he back but other than that, I can't feel any hair WTG (I usually do just one WTG pass on my head). It was a pain to shave with, especially in the back where I can't see, but it's definitely capable of doing the job. Using it was a lot easier when I quit trying to adjust the angle by sight and just listened to the hair being cut. No razor burn either so I'd call this a good shave.\n\nAnd last night's \"normal\" shave -\n\n\n- Soap: Dapper Dragon Kringle\n\n- Brush: Stirling Finest Badger 24x54\n\n- Blade: Personna (2)\n\n- Razor: Schick E 2\n\n- Post: Dapper Dragon Kringle Scale Polish\n\n\nI've only shaved with injectors a handful of times and the majority of that was with a G. That said, I've found this E to be harsh yet very effective. I'm not sure if my technique isn't there yet or if the razor is unduly harsh; I'll have to use it some more and see.\n\nKringle continues to be a favorite scent. The combo of leather, smoke and pipe tobacco is so intoxicating.\n\nIf you read this far, you are free (and encouraged) to pick up your pitchforks and poke the next guy with them.",

It was my first shave with a Type G and also my first time I've had to switch razors mid shave. This thing tore me up pretty good.I'm not sure if this razor is damaged, or if this was just a fluke, but I'm not inclined to use it again.\n\nI was glad to have an alcohol free splash though, so I got that goin for me, which is nice.\n\nEdit: Today we find out: what is a plow truck and when should they be used?",

It was the same Omega pro knot in my other boar, but with a better-looking handle. They still put the logo on with a sticker that starts deteriorating immediately, just like the 10049, which is odd, because they print the logo directly on the S-10049. The printed-on logo comes out much better, or at least more durable.\n\nHaving already worked with this knot before, I went in with a plan for breaking this one in before using it. Every night I would build up a good lather on my palm, then set the brush aside with the lather to dry until the next night. After a couple of weeks, I gave it a use with a normal face lather, just to get a state of the union, but it was still too prickly, so I continued for another 2 weeks. After nearly a month of daily lathers, I rinsed the brush out and let it dry out good for a couple of days then proceeded on to dry brush it for a bit in the evening for a couple of days. During this period, I also used the dry brushing, to identify four or five thick, stiff, black bristles that were very prickly on my hand, and isolated them and clipped them out. Getting rid of those improved the feel dramatically. After that point, I could tell that somewhere between a third and half the tips on the brush had developed split ends.\n\nWith the level of break-in I did before really using it, this brush ended up working better for me than my other Omega boar. It's softer and less scratchy. It builds lather better, and doesn't eat it quite as bad as the other one. In the end though, it just as satisfying for me as the badger brushes. I mentioned it in the 10049 post, but I think it just comes down to me not being a boar brush guy, at least not based on my experience with the Omega's. At some point, I will probably pick up a Semogue to get another perspective on them though. Based on my reading, I think if I do, I'll give it a couple of months of daily lathers before trying to use it.\n\n\n\nHave a good one!\n\n\n\n**Brushes**\n\n[<< Stirling Soap Co., 24mm Finest Fan, Butterscotch Handle](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5pnjtn/monday_sotd_thread_jan_23_2017/dcsj4yb/)\n****\n\n**Tours**\n\n[Razor Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5lefc9/happy_new_year_sotd_thread_jan_01_2017/dbv6f4p/)\n\n[Brush Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5o322q/sunday_sotd_thread_jan_15_2017/dcgf5ud/)\n\n[Soap Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5q99m5/thursday_sotd_thread_jan_26_2017/dcxird1/)",

So naturally, it had to be Grand Havana for Tuesday. Great stuff, wish I had a similar frag to round out the experience. On a less pleasant note, my shower decided to clog, with me in it, during shave prep. It sucked. It's still clogged. There will be plumbing to do when I get home from work today. Ugh.",

It's a phenomenal synthetic. Soft tips as you would come to expect from the Plissoft brushes with an interesting combo of a lower loft but slightly more backbone than the other Plissoft I've tried that makes it feel somehow denser rather than more springy. The face feel is incredible and it whips up thick lather astonishingly fast. I think I've found my new daily driver.\n\nThe new and improved Fine Italian Citrus is also a new favorite. I haven't smelled the original IC (or the second iteration), but I have smelled the OG AdP Colonia EdT and I would have to say that it's a pretty spot-on recreation. Citrus and florals (mostly rose, maybe lavender?) up front with herbs a bit of musk following. It really is a timeless scent that screams white linen pants and Ray-Bans on a yacht in the Santorini islands.\n\nHave a good one, folks!",

Since it is a very mild scented soap, you can go anywhere with your aftershave. I went with Captain's Choice *Lime*. One of my first purchases of aftershave more than 3 years ago. I like citrus scents, but am not a fan of Bay Rum scents. Captain's Choice aftershaves are all based off of the Bay Rum and then work from there. The lime is strong enough to get over on the clove (YUK!) scent. Great Wednesday shaves to all.",

BP (not pictured)\n*Frag*: YSL La Nuit\n\nFirst time in a while posting in the sotd. Someone posted in the other sub about the La Nuit so I woke up this morning and wanted to shave with it. Lol.\nMan, the Manchurian knot is amazing. I cant stress it enough. It's my first real luxury knot. I was told by others advice on purchasing it. Do regret it at all, and not a single hair has shedded.\nAlso I purchased 2mm smaller knot as I've read that it will accommodate the bigger handle. When I combined both the 26mm knot with the 28mm handle. It was a tight fit. So thanks.\nHappy shaving everyone.",

I don't know if my face is smelling this good because of just the Lavanille, or a synergy of the Lavanile and Catie's Bubbles soap. This is my first CB soap - easy loading and lathering, great slickness. Postshave skinfeel isn't quite as nice as Stirling and some others - maybe cuz it's not a tallow formula?\n\nThe Astra SP was really smooth - probably the best blade I've tried yet. ATG pass was almost as easy as XTG.\n\nUsing the homemade tendskin to try and get my neck irritation to heal well enough that I can give shaving it another try.\n\nI made a run to Maggard's today (only 40min away) - and picked up way too many samples and things to add to my collection which will already take me forever to get through. Includes: an arko stick, Godrej shave puck, Haslinger Schafmilch puck, B&M Latha Sandalwood, the aforementioned Lavanille sample, the Catie's Bubbles (2oz container), and a bunch of samples, including First Canadian, L&L, Henri et Victoria, Geo. F. Trumper, Mickey Lee, and a couple others I can't remember.\n\nI only got started a few weeks ago, but probably have at least a year's supply..maybe two years+ of soap. Over 20 Stirling samples, a few full-size pucks, 3 razorock soaps in the mail, close to 20 samples from Maggard (so 0.25oz) now. I also have my second razor in the mail - a Stirling Slant :D\n\nNext shave, I plan to use an unscented or lightly scented soap with the Lavanille aftershave so I can see how much of this scent I'm currently loving is from the Catie's Bubbles vs. the Lavanille.",

One ATG pass with the Rockwell was all it took for BBS after the straight. Getting the angle seems to be the tough part. Too shallow on the first pass and it tugs, Had to find the right balance and all the tug disappeared. The chin is easily the trickiest part it seems like. Overall I'll definitely be giving it another shot.",

I've been looking at this razor for quite some time and it was PIFed to me last week during my lucky streak. So I used it last night on the melon for the first time. Very impressed to say the least. Had it dialed at setting 2 (of 5) and it felt efficient and safe. Tonight we will out to 2.5 and see how she behaves. This one will get a review, but not until I have plenty of shave time with it.",

      "body": "###[Soap-Tour: Barbasol - Soothing Aloe](http://imgur.com/a/QNIQd)\n****\n\n* **Prep**: Stirling Soap Co. - *Lavender Bergamot*\n* **Razor**: Above the Tie - *H2 on Atlas*\n* **Blade**: Gillette - *7 O'Clock Super Platinum* (1)\n* **Brush**: Declaration Brushworks - *The Franklin* #7\n* **Lather**: Barbasol - *Soothing Aloe*\n* **Splash**: Pinaud - *Clubman*\n* **Balm**: Chatillon Lux - *Champs de Levande*\n* **Frag**: Antoino Puig - *Quorum*\n\n****\n\n\n\nOne tour ends, another one begins. For the last two tours, I travelled backwards in time, and worked my way back through my hardware items in the order I obtained them, trying to reveal to myself the lessons I learned along the way. For this one, the collection is large enough that it would take some investigatory efforts of digging through old e-mail receipts to try to put everything in order, and I don't think there's much to be gained from that, so I've taken another approach. I just grouped my soaps by manufacturer, and will work through them one-by-one in alphabetical order. I'll also probably being doing some short notations on each one, but I'm not anticipating the long thought mining posts I was using for the hardware.\n\nAlso, unlike the previous two tours where I held as many things as constant as possible, I'm going to be a little more flexible on this one. I'm going to be using a rotating group of 4 brushes. I know them each very well, and they all perform similarly enough that the differences shouldn't impact my thoughts on any given soap. Also, I'm going to change the splash and balms to line up with the soap for the day rather than holding that constant. I *am* going to stick with the same razor and blade (brand) though. By the end of this one, I should have a pretty good handle on the new H2, which I finally got to take for a spin this morning, and found to be an extremely efficient little guy. Had to explore around a little to get the angles where they felt right. Initial impressions on this one are very good, though I'll be happy to go around again tomorrow with a real soap. This guy really has the chance to de-thrown the Variant.\n\n\n\nOk, so I said I wasn't doing a tour through time, and immediately went back to the original canned cream I was using before wet shaving. Just a coincidence, as Barbasol happens to be first up in the alphabetical order of the manufacturers for my soaps and creams. To optimize the shave, I put the cream in my shave bowl, got the brush wet and worked the foam to knock down some of the air and add in some water, until it got a little closer to that nice yogurty consistency of good lather. It was still pretty foamy though since I didn't want to over water it and break it down. It was also difficult to apply, and wanted to push around my wet face, rather unlike actual lather. But a little experimenting got me a technique to get it applied, however it feels like this stuff and brushes were never supposed to meet.\n\nHonestly, it wasn't terrible overall. By the time it goes on, it lacks some cushion, but with the water, glide was in the acceptable range. I could make do with this in a pinch, but it really makes you appreciate how slick these artisans are getting their soaps. The post-shave feel however was terrible. There was not really any residual slickness, and it was very drying. Thank goodness for the Chatillon Lux balm, it really helped after the drying shave foam.\n\nScent is not bad. It's in that Barbershop category, related most closely to maybe the core of GTB or Mike's natural. Not the same, but in the same family. It leaned a little more into the clean laundry arena though, so not my favorite thing in the world, but completely mild and inoffensive.\n\n\n\n\nHave a good one!\n\n\n\n**Soaps**\n\n[Barrister & Mann - Bay Rum >>](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5qg63f/friday_sotd_thread_jan_27_2017/dcz52bq/)\n****\n\n**Tours**\n\n[Razor Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5lefc9/happy_new_year_sotd_thread_jan_01_2017/dbv6f4p/)\n\n[Brush Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5o322q/sunday_sotd_thread_jan_15_2017/dcgf5ud/)\n\n[Soap Tour] (https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5q99m5/thursday_sotd_thread_jan_26_2017/dcxird1/)",

A pity I only have a sample, and never bought a full tub. But I skipped sample saturday in favor of Kraken, so at least I got some sample use this week. Unforgiven also goes very nice with Roam. And I love that my wife likes Roam. As soon as I cam down from my shave, she commented on how good I smelled. Happy Thursday everyone!",

Baker Street is nice, pretty Juniper forward - which I now can easily identify thanks to /u/C_bubbles.\n\nThe Stirling Fan is a pretty awesome brush. I can understand if the loft is a bit too high for some, but I like a little extra loft on my brushes, so this works great for me. Not as much backbone as some of my other brushes, but it isn't a floppy 3 bander either. At their price, I think everyone should have at least one Stirling finest brush.",

      "body": "###SOTD: 26 January 2017\n#####CADE for /u/old_hiker\n\n***Pre-Shave:*** *Hot water splashes, proto-lather.*\n***Lather:*** *L'Occitane* **CADE** *Rich Cream.*\n***Brush:*** *24mm /u/andrewpalombo* Cashmere *knot in a /u/G_huck stonewood burl beehinve handle.*\n***Razor:*** *Schick Injector E2 (Canadian, non-opening head) w/Chinese Schick blade (1).*\n***Post-Shave:*** *Extra lather, cold water splashes, L'Occitane* **CADE** *After Shave Balm.*\n***Soundtrack:*** *Early morning silence.*\n\n\n\nI hadn't shaved since Sunday, so **CADE** is just what the doctor ordered. Also, since /u/old_hiker doesn't have access to his, we fellow **CADE** lovers must represent. True to form, I did 8 laps around the jar with this cashmere brush and loaded enough cream for 3 shaves.\n\n**CADE** is such amazing stuff; I'm going to be sad if it really does get discontinued. But then, I'm not one to hoard soaps like some kind of soap dragon, so I'll mourn and move on. Perhaps to another expensive French soap, like Martin de Candre.\n\nThis cashmere knot is also fantastic. It's ridiculously soft, and has a good amount of backbone. If you're looking for a new synthetic knot, I can't recommend this highly enough. After two uses, it may be my favorite of my brushes right now. /u/andrewpalombo and /u/G_huck, if you don't want to be notified every time I use it, let me know and I'll take your username links out of the gear block in the future haha.\n\nToday was also the maiden voyage of my recently acquired Canadian Schick E2. Its spring has a tiny bit of play at the rivet, so I was a little concerned about how it would treat me. Against 4 days' growth, I could definitely feel some tactile feedback, but nothing I'd consider to be harshness. 2 passes later and I'm happily in BBS land. Off the cuff I'd say it delivers pretty much the same shave as my open-head E2, but I don't really remember what that was like 45 shaves ago on a fresh blade. My notes report slight harshness on that first shave, but I wonder if I just conflated harshness with tactile feedback. At some point I'll do a side-by-side and we'll see how the two stack up.\n\nSomeone (apologies, I can't remember who!) had mentioned pairing **CADE** with Chatillon Lux's *TSM Fougère,* earlier this week. I was going to try that today because I'd bet it's awesome, but I couldn't resist the full **CADE** treatment, so I'll do it another time.\n\nHappy Thursday, everyone! Weekend's almost here!",

The last two or three shaves I've noticed a bit of a tug, so I think I'm at the upper limit of shaves. I don't know if I will keep a blade for this long again, but I probably won't swap out after 3-4 shaves as I did before.",

I took my GEM featherweight out for a spin and got some amazing results. Once you get the blade angle dialed in, it turns into a smooth and efficient little razor. The safety bar is my only complaint; it sticks out further than I think it ought to, making it slightly harder to dial in the blade angle. Overall, it's a wonderful razor and just goes to show how good manufacturing was before we started producing everything to fall apart.\n\nToday's shave is with the Junior, which was generously given to me by /u/Drivenlegend. I love the head design on this, even if it was a little harder to insert the blade evenly. Speaking of blades, the stiffer SE and injector blades are my jam. I have fairly coarse hair, and DE blades skip and bite more on ATG passes (I'm sure technique is also partially to blame). With the stiffer SE blades though, I can go for an irritation-free ATG pass on most of my face, and I'm loving it. I don't know if I'll ever be able to go back to DEs.\n\nHave a great day, everyone",

Hot damn I never smelled the original but this is definitely one of my favorite scents now. I might have been bitten by the dihydromyrcenol bug again but the effects didn't last for more than a few minutes after splashing so I think this one is a keeper.\n\nI still don't know how I feel about the V2OC head. It always feels like my angle is off because of how the blade sits on the base plate. I've used it for about a month's worth of shaves overall and it seems like either it's not cutting or it's scraping. Oh well, I'll use it again today and then move on to the PL602 to continue my short razor tour.",

I can't stop smelling my hands. The fragrance lasts, at least lightly, through most of the day. It's not quite as nice on my skin as the CL aftershaves, but I definitely want some in my rotation.\n\nI did one pass on my neck for the first time in a couple days - it was starting to get itchy. Feels pretty good right after the shave, but there were still red bumps that I went over, so guessing those will probably remain. Shaving on my neck feels kinda like it's twanging the hairs - anybody have any idea what might cause that? I get pretty thick whiskers on the neck. I'm thinking I'm just not too adept at maintaining proper angle down there, but idk really.",

Love the little touch of menthol it has too. Great shave in general, although I'm not the biggest fan of face lathering with the S-Brush (its too springy without a full lather on it IMO).\n\nEnjoy your Friday!",

Nope!, hurt like hell. While trying to make it work i added too much water to the little bit of soap from the sample I had and decided to start over.\n\nGrabbed my First snow sample and my Synthetic(should have grabbed my badger) and started in on it. Mother Fucker was that thing scratchy and I couldn't get enough lather in it to splay. I am half tempted to throw the damn thing away and buy a different synthetic. I mean my skin could have already been pissed off from the boar scrub but it was not comfortable. I finally got enough lather going to get a decent two pass shave in but damn I could have made better choices.\n\nThe bright side, I finished two samples this morning I didn't really care for. The MLS scent isn't for me but I am glad they have fans of it out there and people look forward to it. The B&M scent is nice but I know if given my choices it would lose out to many other soaps available.\n\nHope everyone had a better shave than me.",

I wasn't really sure of it when\n/u/whollykaw talked to me about it. I love bacon but as a soap I don't know. It was good. I do think it's missing something. Maybe needs more smoke or a touch of something sweet but it's close. And normally I would say bacon scented anything is a novelty item but this could really work as a normal soap. Wouldn't want it in a splash or anything but pairing it up with Leviathan or Mother fucking ROAM would make for a hell of a shave.",

The Barrister & Mann white label is still some good stuff. It really let the H2 shine today. I picked this up because when I first started wet shaving, I had no idea what Bay Rum smelled like. I realize there are a wide range, but this one was enough to give me a taste and know it's something I like, but not my favorite scent family. It's sweet from the rum, and spicy from the bay, I can see why it's completely natural to want to add clove, though I can't tell if there is actually any clove in this one, but I don't think so. It also has a sour sharpness that is reminicent of a certain part of citrus smells, but doesn't quite smell citrusy. The only problem was I don't have any frags that pair up really well with it. The givenchy isn't a bad match, more of a complimentary scent than one that reinforces and enhances. Overall though, a great shave today.\n\n\n\nHave a good one!\n\n\n\n**Soaps**\n\n[<< Barbasol - Soothing Aloe](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5q99m5/thursday_sotd_thread_jan_26_2017/dcxird1/)\n\n[Barrister & Mann - Beaudelaire >>](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5qmrtl/saturday_sotd_thread_jan_28_2017/dd0n7oa/)\n****\n\n**Tours**\n\n[Razor Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5lefc9/happy_new_year_sotd_thread_jan_01_2017/dbv6f4p/)\n\n[Brush Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5o322q/sunday_sotd_thread_jan_15_2017/dcgf5ud/)\n\n[Soap Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5q99m5/thursday_sotd_thread_jan_26_2017/dcxird1/)",

Been a week from hell at work. Finally got to use the famous Baker Street scent and I am in love. Love the scent on this stuff. Makes me wish I would have jumped on the sale back when Strop Shoppe was closing up. Decided to go back and use the General now that I got my blade sampler from TryABlade and yet again, I don't think these blades are the ones for me. Tugging on the first pass, second pass was fine but still only had 1 day of growth. Also, first time using the 30mm Tuxedo knot and I love it. Pretty sure this the exact same knot as the black wolf. Softness was pretty much dead on but the 30mm seemed a hell of a lot more dense than my 24mm black wolf knot. Have a great shave everyone!",

Haven't decided if I will try the sample again, or just pack it up.\n\nHave a nice Saturday!",

I will go to my grave saying the Goat is hands down the best Gourmand scent in the shaving world. Still haven't completely nailed down the Maggards Slant. Got a spot of irritation next to my adams apple. I tend to lose the angle occasionally. Still really enjoying the razor though. The asthetics of it are just really nice. Might try some different blades in it but the Wizamet/PolSilver and Rapira Platinum Lux work in everything for me so don't think I'll find better. And looking at the Wizamet and PolSilver blades I'm about 100% sure they are the same exact blade. Feel the same and the writing on the blade is word for word. Unfortunately they are both discontinued but whatever.",

Beaudelaire is a georgeous scent. Clean and dirty all at the same time. The white label B&M base is good stuff, but the glissant definitely takes it up a notch in slickness. Had a few things out for pairing options, Gucci Guilty Black was too fresh, and the tabacco in the D&G Pour Homme wasn't doing it for me, but the earthy almost vegetal green scent on the Chatillon Lux seemed like a nice boost to the greeness of the Beaudelaire, and I had both the salve and EdT, so they got the call. Good smells today, like the rich lush days of spring.\n\n\n\nHave a good one!\n\n\n\n**Soaps**\n\n[<< Barrister & Mann - Bay Rum](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5qg63f/friday_sotd_thread_jan_27_2017/dcz52bq/)\n\n[Barrister & Mann - Cologne Russe >>](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5qszp8/sunday_sotd_thread_jan_29_2017/dd1zqvk/)\n****\n\n**Tours**\n\n[Razor Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5lefc9/happy_new_year_sotd_thread_jan_01_2017/dbv6f4p/)\n\n[Brush Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5o322q/sunday_sotd_thread_jan_15_2017/dcgf5ud/)\n\n[Soap Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5q99m5/thursday_sotd_thread_jan_26_2017/dcxird1/)",

Now, he's developed enough independence for me to shower while he's playing, so today I did an experiment to determine if he can keep himself occupied while I shave as well.\n\nIt was successful. He popped into the bathroom a handful of times to include me in his make-believe play, which was fun.\n\nSometimes I take a step back and look at him, and marvel at how different he is now compared to even as recent as Halloween. I wonder how long it'll be before he wants to shave with me.\n\nAnyway, *Ghost Town Barber* and Clubman Special Reserve: For when you absolutely need to smell manly AF.

The B&B Essential Boar has knocked the BC Cerda off and become my favorite boar brush. I can't explain it - it's just that good, and still seems to be getting better after about 50 shaves.\n\nToday's razor was one that I've been hunting for 3 years now, and finally got one at my self-imposed $60 max price for any razor (thanks /u/zenless8). The first stroke with the Barbasol Floating Head razor immediately propelled it into the DE all-star list with the Old Type thick cap and NEW Deluxe. First impression is that it shaves a lot like the Merkur 37C or iKon Tech, very aggressive/efficient but surprisingly smooth. The weekly goatee purge was effortless.\n\nI'll have to do a side-by-side with a few razors once I get more familiar with the Barbasol. The handle is longer and the razor is heavier than I'm used to, but not overly so like the stainless RRSS. Definitely a keeper.",

Along with a sample of Baker Street and a bar of soap. I of course had to give it a try. I had about 2 days' worth of growth, and just plugged in the Astra SP I'd been using in my other razor.\n\nThe razor felt very efficient - a little bit less forgiving on angle than my Maggard V3, but I don't think I really gave myself much of any irritation, in part because I didn't feel the need to go over places as much. We'll see how it feels in a few hours, but right now my face feels really smooth and not at all irritated. Even my neck feels pretty good (just did one pass there).",

Well, that is the first pass before I negligently dropped some water onto the brush, then the lather wasn't stellar. Still a forgiving soap, I guess. I feel confident with stropping and the razor provides excellent feedback, letting me get another cut/burn free shave. Splashing cold water on before the AS is sublime, and Ghost Town Barber was the proper scent for the beer drinking and dominoes that ensued.",

Been way to long since I posted a SOTD, and I had a lovely shearing experience this morning.\n\nFirst of all, has anyone else out there tried Stirling Soap Company's \"Pig Trail\" bath soap? The name kind of threw me, but the description of the scent made me add it to my quarterly order of bath soaps from Stirling. I love the scent. It's apparently the same fragrance used in their Ozark Mountain Shave Soap. Hell, it makes the whole bathroom smell great!\n\nToday's lather/post/frag combination can't miss. Every time SdM comes up in my rotation, I seriously consider chucking out all my other shave soaps and becoming a monogamous SdM user! However, those thoughts quickly fade when I put soaps like MdC, Czech & Speake O&C or one of my 4 B&M Lathers into my \"on deck\" shaving rack.\n\nI've got to get on this damn site more often. I see several new names, the new sidebar and site organization, but the kicker for me was when I noticed I missed /u/hawns Chatillon Lux AMA dammit! Hope to make my visits here a daily thing again soon.\n\nAll the best to my old mates here. I look forward to getting a sense of what new products and combinations the new /r/Wetshaving redditors are using!\n\nBest wishes to y'all for the week ahead, and enjoy your Sunday.",

I had only used a sample of the og Baker Street (se I believe) once, but from what I remember the scent strength on the stirling is much higher. Good shave overall, but I did detect a weird smokiness to the opening of the balm that I didn't smell in the soap.",

I stuck to two passes on my face and it still feels nearly BBS - this razor really knocks stuff down quickly.\n\nI like the scent of Stirling Blu, but it's pretty light once you lather and I don't notice the scent at all post-shave. Bon Vivant is good, but I don't really love it. I have a full bottle, so thinking I might try to swap it on the Bazaar for a different artisan splash.\n\nIt was a little weird using four different things on my face after I shaved.

The other, which isn't surprising because of some of the shared elements, is Adagio. I think it's something in the cherry note/accord that they both share. I don't dislike it, and it has grown on me some, but it's still not in my favorites. Since it won't be coming back this year, I'm glad I didn't manage to sell my set though. It was hard finding a pairing for it. For a bit I was leaning towards YSL La Nuit. It's sweet enough and they share some cardamom, but the woody elements were discordant. Then I glanced at the 1775 Noble. It's a pretty simple fragrance I picked up really early in my fragrance exploration, based on smelling test strips at a Perfumania. I like the opening, but its fairly simple, linear and lacks sillage and longevity. The listed notes are bergamot, amber, vanilla and woodsy notes. I also pick up cinnamon and spices, and not too much \"woodsy notes\". It doesn't get in to the rotation often, but it works pretty well with the Dickens.\n\n\n\nHave a good one!\n\n\n\n**Soaps**\n\n[<< Barrister & Mann - Cologne Russe](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5qszp8/sunday_sotd_thread_jan_29_2017/dd1zqvk/)\n\n[Barrister & Mann - Hallows >>](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5r74bu/tuesday_sotd_thread_jan_31_2017/dd52wdy/)\n****\n\n**Tours**\n\n[Razor Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5lefc9/happy_new_year_sotd_thread_jan_01_2017/dbv6f4p/)\n\n[Brush Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5o322q/sunday_sotd_thread_jan_15_2017/dcgf5ud/)\n\n[Soap Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5q99m5/thursday_sotd_thread_jan_26_2017/dcxird1/)",

Felt comfortable during the shave, but hoo-boy did that alcohol sting right around the chin/jaw area. I'm thinking that until I get the technique down a little better, I should stick to two passes with this slant. The bit of extra smoothness isn't worth risking some irritation - we'll see if any of this flares up or anything. I think I'll let this Astra SP live out the rest of its shaves in my Maggard V3, then try a milder blade in the Stirling Slant and see if I notice a difference.\n\nI went with a pretty scentless lineup today, because I just got a shipment of EdT samples in the mail today, so I wanted to have a clean base to apply one to. Haven't chosen what I'll try out, but I'm excited as this is my first venture into fragrances aside from aftershave.\n\nThe Godrej soap performed pretty well, as reviews indicated it would. It was a little annoying to load, and I ended up having to reload between the second and third passes, but that's just because I couldn't be bothered to move it out of the little container it came in into a bigger bowl or mug. The scent is kind of a clean, very slightly sweet chalky smell. Not really pleasing, but certainly inoffensive and light.",

I will note I only did my cheeks with it hence why I had 2 razors listed. Being my first time using one I had no idea what to expect. All I can say is it is a completely different beast. The sharpness of the blade is on a entirely different level, figuring out the amount of pressure and angle to hold it at will take a lot of trial and error for me. Heck just figuring out hold to hold it for the different parts of my face will be a challenge. In the end I wound up doing a with the grain pass and nicked myself once on my jaw line, I got a little bold with how far down I could get with so little experience and then I tried a across the the grain pass. I found the across the grain easier, due to having less hair to cut and less tug on the blade and not having to apply as much pressure. I got a decently close shave which was supprising since it was my first attempt at this. It would be comparable to a single pass with my double edge razor.\n\nAs for the soap and the rest of my shave, Dapper Dragon Green Dragon is now officially my favorite set. The soap is excellent quality and provides plenty of cushioning and slickness while smelling amazing. What really sets it apart for me though is the scale polish. If you have not tried it you are really missing out, it moisturizes your skin and has the perfect amount of menthol. Once i work through my assortment of soaps this will be the first one I reorder. The rest of the shave was pretty ordinary and a lot quicker then my attempt at using a straight razor.",

If you haven't tried any Viking Soaps (not affiliated with Viking Blades) yet I highly recommend snagging some up if you can. It is pretty great stuff for a great price.

Hallows is a dark yet beautiful scent. Rich and earthy decay. I didn't catch the pre-sale for this, but waited for the general release and fortunately snagged the soap and splash as soon as it went live. Due to the surfeit of soaps I've acquired, I haven't spent all that much time with it, but every time I have used it, the experience is delightful. Lots of pairing options for this. Anything vetiver heavy will work, Black Touch and Encre Noire came to mind, but with Hallows, the vetiver to me is more of a role player and less of center piece. To me the oakmoss is what steals the show, wrapping all the dark and dank in a soft creamy blanket while reinforcing and enhancing the earthiness. Based on that, I was leaning more towards mossy choices like Azzaro Pour Homme or at a stretch Aramis Tuscany, but in the end, Hallows seemed to bring out the best parts of Quorum, so that was today's choice.\n\n\n\nHave a good one!\n\n\n\n**Soaps**\n\n[<< Barrister & Mann - Dickens](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5qzndl/monday_sotd_thread_jan_30_2017/dd3fpwr/)\n\n[Barrister & Mann - Latha Sandalwood >>](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5rehi1/wednesday_sotd_thread_feb_01_2017/dd6ozow/)\n****\n\n**Tours**\n\n[Razor Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5lefc9/happy_new_year_sotd_thread_jan_01_2017/dbv6f4p/)\n\n[Brush Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5o322q/sunday_sotd_thread_jan_15_2017/dcgf5ud/)\n\n[Soap Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5q99m5/thursday_sotd_thread_jan_26_2017/dcxird1/)",

One. More. Shave. I can probably kill it off tomorrow. It's been a really nice soap and I've enjoyed using it.\n\nThis razor was waiting for me at the post office when we got back from Texas. It's a gift from a friend. What a surprise this thing is. For an inexpensive razor it shaves remarkably well. It's not going to win any beauty contests, but the results are quite good. Very efficient and I found it to be smooth and comfortable. I'll likely use it again tomorrow.\n\nFirst day back to work was a grinding long shift. More of the same to follow.",

This injector was so smooth. First time using one and I'm pretty impressed with the ease of use, minus putting the blade in. Still have no clue what model this guy is. I believe its an E type since there is a seam in the handle and came with a blue cardboard box. Great, quick shave today. Have a great shave everyone!\n\nEdit: Courtesy of /u/NeedsMoreMenthol it seems that I have an E-3 Injector!",

The Jefferson handle is the most comfortable handle I've ever used.\n\nFirst go with the Calypso R1. This razor looks and feels really nice. The weight of the razor was a surprise but I was able to dial in on the razor quickly. 3 passes and no nicks or irritation. Think I might like this more than the Blackbird if this BBS lasts a while.",

The slant is quite close, even with the blade installed for more shaves than I would typically do.\n\nI'm trying to use up the One-X, not because there's anything wrong with it but just so I can eliminate one more soap from my inventory. I actually really enjoy the scent. The matching aftershave splash is fantastic, inexpensive, and very long-lasting.

I found that the handle it came with was way too light for my preference, so I swapped it for the beefier iKon bulldog handle. All I can say is that my results were excellent, and it mowed through 2 days of growth with ease and only 1 weeper. It looks a little funny with the gold plated head and stainless steel handle, but it shaves great (possible replating of the head?). Baker Street is very nice. Definitely juniper-forward like others have described. As always, performance is top-tier.",

This was my first shave with any of their products. The lather was excellent, definitely right up their with any of the best artisans I've tried. The scent was pleasant, kind of like Hallows with a touch of peppermint. I think I like Hallows a bit better; I'm really picky about peppermint. I had not tried them yet, largely due to the high cost of their soaps, but after this I would definitely purchase some if it was in a scent I found more different than something I already owned.",

Both razors are evenly matched, with nicely knurled 4\" handles and almost equal weight - 86g vs 85g. They're both on the heavy side for my preference, but unlike the similarly weighted 3.25\" Fatboy and Aristocrats, they don't feel as chunky; the weight is better distributed due to the longer handles.\n\nShave-wise, expected results did not match actual results. The Barbasol is a much smoother and less aggressive razor. Not that the Barbasol is mild - far from it, it's just that the NEW Deluxe is very aggressive and has more raw blade feel. Both razors are very aggressive/efficient, mowing down everything in two passes with no hint of discomfort.\n\nUp for tomorrow: Barbasol vs Old Type thick cap. I expect this to be a much closer pairing since the OT is less aggressive than the NEW Deluxe. I still stand by my opinion that the NEW Deluxe is the most aggressive razor Gillette ever made.",

It's ridiculously comfortable and efficient. I've enjoyed every other SE I've tried, but the pushbutton could compete for a place in my desert island setup.\n\nMy face has been so dry it's started peeling. I've tried all sorts of lotions, and I even resorted to slathering shea butter on my face. I needed a little love this morning, and T+S did not disappoint. You owe it to yourself to try Ryan's products if you haven't already.\n\nHave a good day!",

Smells great - performance was alright.\n\nThis Astra blade still seems to be going strong - not real tuggy or anything. Didn't shave the problem areas of my neck again. Razor bumps going down, but still a little red.\n\nI think that once CL switches to their new packaging (cuz it looks purty) I'm going to pick up a full bottle of Unconditional Surrender aftershave and a bottle of the EdT. I'll probably pass on the soap to keep budget more reasonable, but we'll see.",
