I won't have most of my equipment with me so the photos may taper off this week so I thought I would leave you with something nice.\n\nI shot this photo with the idea to try to capture something along the lines of a sexy fragrance advertisement. Lady Gaga FAME was the inspiration, but Tom Ford for Men, Eros and Gucci Guilty have all done similar things in the past. To be clear, this is NOT commissioned work or indicative of an upcoming product release, just something for fun.\n\nThanks to /u/Blufury1 I was finally able to finish the total set for Night Music. I know the scent is divisive and not without its detractors but I really enjoy it. To me I get a creamy, powdery musk followed by vanilla and a bit of sweetness. It feels like something sexy and carnal. It's not office appropriate, it's a behind closed doors, hushed glances and sultriness type of scent.\n\nTry that soap lists the notes as Vanilla, Bergamot, Musk, Iris and Strawberry. The soap is well blended but I can get hints of each of these. It does lead with the musk notes but fades after about 30 min's and unlike a lot of soaps there does seem to be a natural progression from top, mid and base notes. The base is the classic Glissant and after having used that base in perhaps 10 different B&M soaps I have no complaints about it. It is a consistent performer that is beginner friendly and can handle a lot of water. The lather itself is consistently good with a medium density and good slickness. I would say it is about comparable to Declaration Grooming Bison base.\n\nPost shave I finished out with a small splash of Night Music aftershave. I really don't find that I need much to hydrate my skin as the soap is not terribly trying compared to others I can think of.\n\nIn other news, I think I am going to be putting in an order at Maggards for some APR. This will be my first experience with them and I am leaning towards Fenchurch. I am open to suggestions though. I love their label design and I want to shoot something very 80's outrun style. Since I am in LA this week I might also take the opportunity to do some street photography. I love graffiti as an art form.\n\nHope everyone has a good Monday!\nRobot\n",

Worst one all year, methinks.\n\nI don't know if it was the blade or me. Probably some combo of both. This is the second Aeterna blade I've ever used and I don't remember having any issues with the last one. I don't believe this is a dud blade either because there was no tugging or irritation during the shave but I found that I did have to buff far more than I normally do. It just wasn't very efficient at all. Granted, I haven't shaved since the 27th but still. I've gone longer without a shave and had better results. I also fucked up the lining on my goatee from all the buffing.\n\nI opened up a weeper that was so pissed off that I had to dispatch a styptic pen to stop the gore. First pass too. I hate having blood in my lather. But the Blood Gods do demand the occasional offering and today was my day.\n\nSpeaking of the lather, it was blameless. First try with Ballenclaugh and it was great. Probably the only good part. The lather was thick and creamy and the scent is nice. A deep, rich, warm cherry. While I liked it, I probably won't keep this tub, though. Not a huge fan of cherry anything, in general, but I had to try Ballenclaugh somehow. Into the \"to sell or maybe even PIF, in some way, shape, or form\" pile it goes.\n\nThis aftershave is meh. It's got a very sweet scent but I wish there was more alcohol in it. Also a stopper, I always end up using more than I need because it comes out so fast. Gah.\n\nLamplight Penance is still the shit. Would also make for a great album name. I've been slowly rationing this sample. I will be very sad when it's gone.\n\nThe song is a Deftones cover but this chick totally makes it her own thing. Killer remix.\n\nHappy Monday. Here we are again.",

I've been hinting for the past month or so that I was going to bring donuts today, emphasizing to no end that there would be no funny business. I had an email all ready to go to let people know that the totally non-messed with donuts were in the kitchen waiting to be consumed. And at the end of the day, when no one touched the donuts out of fear of getting a mayonnaise filled donut, I would take home dozens of perfectly delicious, actually non-messed with donuts and be a fat kid...\n\n[Except for the teeny tiny detail that I forgot about... the effing donut shop is closed on Mondays.](https://i.chzbgr.com/full/6855567360/hA538EEAB/)",

I barely even shave my face anymore. Once a week, tops. It's been interesting. The scent I use matters much less to me, given the lather isn't that close to my face. I really do love *Lonestar* though. Very good warm weather scent.\n\n\nI'm totally on board with synthetic brushes all of a sudden. Until last week, I was really happy with my boar brushes. They feel nice, and they are really cheap. Breaking them in can be fun, too. However, I never really got a dense *and* wet lather, until this synthetic showed up in my mailbox. Using bases like NO and Glissant has gotten much better. It's waaaay easier to load, too. I love it so much, I got in on last night's Wolf Whiskers waitlist. Gotta figure that out next. I may make a post somewhere about WW brushes.\n\n\n*If you want to post a glamour shot of your Wolf Whiskers brush here, by all means, go for it.*\n\n\nGreat shaves all!",

But Mo is THE bad boy of the shaving soap game right now and keeps it fresh with new bases and risqué scents. Haters gonna hate. This soap is no different. Sort of a peppery and tart rose note meets a milky somewhat sophisticated base. I wouldn't call it my favorite scent but it grew on me during while lathering. I tend to like rose forward scents and the rose in this isn't.\n\nAlso took a risk in todays Blade selection . Have heard a lot about GSBs in the community and decided to give it a try (I have a bunch of blades I bought to try out). It's not bad. I don't think it'll be a staple for me, but hey it was fun to try to something new. And it performed just fine!\n\nThe real star of this shave was the Paladin brush which is breaking in quite nicely. The definition of backbone this one. Got a great creamy and slick lather out of it. I've been exploring badger brushes in the 8-9 months probably, and as other rabbit holes in wetshaving go, I have a mini collection now. The biggest difference in the Paladin is the shape imo. It's good but I've been enjoying for fan shaped knots recently. That being said, this soap is fairly hard so the backbone really Game me the load I needed. The shape allows you to better control the lather distribution and is more precise than the fan if that's your thing.\n\nI also took a risk on technique today! I typically do a two pass plus cleanup shave. But our baby had me up extra early so I decided to to add a cross grain pass (another reason why it was good to load heavy). I'm still not convinced the cross grain is necessary for my beard growth. WTG and ATG plus cleaning up the neck area tends to get me the same results with better mileage (but what can I say about mileage in this hobby...hmm.)\n\nExcited for the next couple days. And there's more travel and intrigue to come. Shave gears coming with me!\n\nHappy Monday ya'll! fuck work!\n\n",

I know I overload sometimes but hell I under loaded big time because, even though I've been looking forward to killing a soap, now I'm afraid of what it'll feel like. The only soap I've killed before is Executive Man and I know I can order another tub whatever day of the week I feel like and boom. There it is. It'll be ok though. I'll be ok. I'll do right next time I shave with it.\n\nAnd I know this is all part of Try That Soap's April Fools Day thing, but I wonder what a lavender lollipop would taste like.... Damn. Now I've gotta google and see what I can get.\n\nOh and thanks for jumping in for the assist u/MadDingersYo and opening this thread!",

Both of these razors make a sound of buttering toast and I love the organoleptic properties of this shave. (Needed to use that word. Done with it now) I've become a big fan of the SE razor and since the Gems don't seem as sought after as Gillette, they can be had for pretty cheap. My brother found three at an antique shop and sent them out to me.\n\nSakura Musk has a light to medium strength, floral cherry blossom forward with a masculine musk base that smells really good to me. I enjoy the florals with a woodsy follow up. (I'm looking for a manly jasmine btw if anyone knows of one) The lather builds easily and is very rich but I didn't find this vegan base to be as slick as Lotus Eater or Southern Witchcrafts. I can 100% chalk any performance issues up to my own fault since I'm no lather hero. It was a close shave nonetheless.\n\nOn another note, I'm thinking of using my Stirling Badger exclusively for the rest of the month to see if the knot changes and to really get familiar with it.\n\nSpring break is over. Back to the dual full time grind.\n\n",

Trying out the Cade hard soap for the first time. And a new blade in the Bronze.\n\n#### ❧ Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Timeless - Bronze .38 Solid Bar ::: Gillette - 7 o'clock - Blk ‹8 uses›)*\n\nNot quite hot-knife-through-butter smooth, but almost. A very comfy and enjoyable shave. And it was on 1.5 days of growth, more than usual. Great combination, for me.\n\nNo tugging or irritation, and such a close cut.\n\n#### ❧ Soap Notes\n*^(Cade - Hard Soap)*\n\nSome folks online said this soap was hard to lather. But since this is a legit hard soap, I soaked it with about 2mm of water on top for several minutes and it loaded up as easily as any other. In fact, I played it safe and loaded for 45 sec, which was about twice as long as I needed.\n\nI dumped all the bloom water into the lather bowl, and it was a bit too much for a creamy lather. I'll try again with less water some time and see what kind of better lather I get.\n\n45 second load with lightly-wet boar brush + unknown amount of water from the soaked puck = 7 passes of light, non-creamy, but slick lather.\n\nScent: very light, but there was some of that Cade woody/musky/whatever it is that came through and was enjoyable.\n\nScent Strength: 4/10, lightly present during shaving.\n\nBowl - I used the XL version of this bowl:\nhttps://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3392930\n\n\n#### ❧ Brush Notes\n*^(Semogue - 2000 Boar ‹5 uses›)*\n\nA delight to use. I'd consider this one broken in my now, I'm sure. and it didn't take long at all. Usually I would soak it for 1-3 hrs prior to shave. Today it was just 15 mins, and it has great comfy tips, big splay, and medium backbone.\n\n#### ❧ Shave Quality\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Smooth\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Cut flush to where I just see the tips (above average for me)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm)\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

      "body": "**2019-04-01 Not April Foolsin' SOTD**\n\n**Prep:** Took a warm shower, shaved with cool water\n\n**Brush:** Maggard 24mm blond Synthetic\n\n**Lather:** Stirling Sandpiper\n\n**Razor:** 1955 Ball-end Tech\n\n**Blade:** [Dorco Titan](http://tryablade.com/blade/dorco-titan-stainless) (shave #1)\n\n**Post:** Stirling Unscented Post-Shave Balm\n\n**Fragrance:** Stirling Sandpiper aftershave (applied to wrist)\n\n**Thoughts:**\n\nFirst time trying any Dorco blade and I went with the Titan, as it's supposed to be an improvement over their other blades and those ones tend to get poor-to-mixed reviews. The box art is very spiffy and nicely printed, the box itself it made from quality cardboard with nice crisp corners, and the blade wrappers are even printed in full color on nice paper... not just thin wax paper. No wax dots either. Everything about the presentation says, \"this is a quality piece of equipment...\"\n\nUntil you unwrap the blade. First thing I noticed was that the tabs were not a clean, crisp, straight edge as one would expect; rather, they're both a bit ragged and rough, leading me to suspect that their blade parting shear was probably dull the day they made my blades. Not an encouraging thing to see. The cutting edges looked normal though, so I popped it into my trusty Tech and tried it out (since it tends to handle shitty blades better than my Super Speed or Edwin Jagger).\n\nAs for performance, the shave was passable. Didn't get me BBS in my problem patches, but the tugging level was at that \"gently scritching your whiskers\" level of tug, not \"ripping whiskers out with tweezers\" level. It wasn't as super-smooth and effortless as Astra or Wilkinson or even Shark, but it got the job done without hurting. Face feels a bit itchy with a hint of razor burn though. I can't decide whether to give this blade a chance in my Super Speed on Wednesday or just throw it out already since I know it isn't living up to the standard set by other blades. It's a battle between \"this isn't worth the trouble\" and \"test all the things! for science!\"\n\nAnyway, blades aside, I like the fragrance of YSL La Nuit de l'Homme but it burns my sinuses. Stirling Sandpiper shave soap, which is based on the YSL, does not burn like the real stuff. I ordered an aftershave sample (because TotC doesn't carry EdT samples yet) to give it a shot as a scent and see if I could wear the Stirling instead of the YSL. So far so good. I'll see how it goes through the day.\n\nUpdate: Sandpiper is too overwhelming. I'm going to pack up what I have left of my samples for next Christmas and save it for the holidays.",

It's so simple I'm kicking myself for not thinking of it a year ago - Breakstone's. Beautifully dense and shiny, ready to use out of the tub, and best of all locally-sourced from the market less than 2 miles from Mammoth headquarters.\n\n\n\nI've heard folks say they like their lather to protect, but I've never experienced a lather than can stop a razor's edge. I have high hopes for all-purpose joint compound, a fantastic ingredient I plan to incorporate into Mammoth v.38.\n\n\n\nThe Purdy 2.5\" brush continues to impress as a multi-purpose workhorse. Well broken in at this point, soft tips and a springy backbone, perfect for painting strokes.\n\n\n\nThe real star of the shave was the razor. Handle is made from sustainable bamboo, and feels familiar in the hand. There have been revolutions in multi-blade razors in the past, but none have combined DE, SE, and AC blades in one razor. The unique offset position of the three blades means you can dial up one blade, two blades, or all three at once depending on your angle and stroke. I find all three are best for wiping away multiple days of growth, while just one or two is great for use as a daily driver. As always, ymmv.\n\n\n\nI did experience some burning from the splash, which made me wish I'd gone with cold brew. But it's also the caffeine dilating my capillaries- the redness is a sign that it's working.\n\n\n\nPost shave feel: determined, a little hungry, but mostly [Joaquin Phoenix's Forehead](https://youtu.be/Q9UDVyUzJ1g).",

      "body": "Monday 4/1 SOTD\n\n​\n\n* Razor: Timeless Bronze SB\n* Blade: Gillette 7:00 Yellow (4)\n* Brush: Muhle STF V2 25mm in faux horn resin\n* Soap: PAA / Crown King Supereme Sandalwood Science CK6 base\n* Post: PSC Caffeinated After Shave Balm\n* Frag: Caron Pour Un Homme EDT\n\n​\n\n**Product Notes:**\n\n* **Soap**: All about the soap today. I've been a reluctant fan of the most recent PAA / CK base prior to CK6 (called the CK base). For less than $4 an ounce, CK worked very well for me, giving a shave roughly as good as the WK vegan and better than Noble Otter tallow.\n* Use of the product was a low grade moral challenge for me. The marketing efforts and general demeanor of SmytHodges made me feel mildly guilty about using his stuff, but, pragmatically, I expect virtually all successful businessmen to be morally flawed in some significant ways, so I was able to see my way to intermittent use of CK products.\n* CK6 adds three new Brazilian \"wonder butters\" to the already quite buttery CK base. The price point has also soared to $25 for 5 ounces rather than the CK base 4 ounce tubs. $5 an ounce is keeping pace with many other brands, but clearly also represents an unstated premise, mainly that the new base is worth the added cost.\n* I liked Vetiver Planet, the vetiver blend scent from CK in the old CK base, and so wanted to try the sandalwood equivalent, which promises a blend of three sandalwood cultivars. Supreme Sandalwood Science is the name of the blend. (SSS)\n* **Scent Ingredients**: The price point is actually a tad low for a lot of sandalwood in a soap. Every other CK6 soap is the same cost, including those that use all or mostly synthetic scent designs. Shouldn't this exotic composition, using three cultivars of sandalwood, including one from India, cost more than a bunch of synthetic chemicals?\n* Generally, yes, it should. Even CK's own Planet Vetiver in the CK base cost $4 more than the rest of the product line because it allegedly had expensive natural vetiver cultivars in it. Is SmytHodges subsidizing the use of the three sandalwoods here to pass value along to his customers? What do you think?\n* Suffice to say. I think there might be a blend of sandalwood synthetic replacers in the SSS mix, along with whatever natural sandalwood there may be. How can I say this?\n* Well, first and foremost, SSS stings my face moderately. My face is utterly unaffected by real sandalwood (as used by various other brands of solid reliability in marketing claims) but burns when covered in various synthetic replacers, though not all. (Sandalwood is widely simulated by a lot of different synthetic blends.) So stinging usually means synthetic sandalwood is in the mix. And because there are no other scent chemicals mentioned in the scent description, I am left to assume that the naturals in here have been \"complemented\" to some degree with some synthetics.\n* Other evidence? Website description and packaging makes no claim of \"all natural essential oils\" for the scent. Just a simple \"fragrance\" item at the end of the ingredients. Most (all?) other brands using real sandalwood prominently trumpet the fact to high heaven. Maybe the notoriously unsubtle non-humble Mr. SmytHodges has decided to take the understated path of minimal bombast in introducing this flagship of his pricey new base. But does that seem likely?\n* Besides that, we have the known past history of the artisan. Even in [the description of the product](https://phoenixartisanaccoutrements.com/collections/phoenix-crown-king-shaving-soaps/products/supreme-sandalwood-science-artisan-shave-soap-ultra-premium-formula-ck-6-5-oz) (worth a read, for all the claims made about the Brazilian butter trio also), SmytHodges tells a charming anecdote about how he told testers of the CK6 base that this was his new tallow base. And, ho, ho, how surprised they were to discover he was fibbing to them after they really liked the new \"tallow\" base! Indeed, how surprising.\n* **Scent:** Anyway, authentic sandalwood content aside, the soap smells pretty nice. Not as raw and woodsy as the other cheaper real sandalwoods out there (e.g. Proraso Red) but a sweet, powdery kind of understated sandalwood. I rather liked it, save for the stinging part, but buyers should understand that sandalwood is no lavender or vetiver, that is to say it is not a very potent scent on its own. This is a nice scent, but it will not blow your scent receptors out. I personally like my soap scents more powerful and complex, but this is a very good interpretation of pure sandalwood, no matter what aromachemicals may actually be in the mix.\n* **Performance**: Decent, but not worth the added cost of admission. I found performance to be generally similar to the old CK base, save for the fact that CK6 needed more water than even B&M Reserve does. Without immense amounts of H2O, the CK6 lather loses a lot of glide. With plenty of water, I found glide comparable to the older CK base.\n* Protection was also comparable between CK and CK6. Post shave of CK6 felt slightly superior to that of CK, but, per the Pooter Theory, no one really needs a soap to have that good of a post shave anyway, as most users with sensitive skin use a balm or repair splash after the shave. So the one element of CK6 that is slightly superior to those of CK is a non-starter in some ways.\n* **Conclusion**: I feel as if a great weight has lifted from my conscience. At $25 a tub, I am not at all tempted to buy more CK6. Even if the scent was more to my liking and was non stingy to my face, I do not see enough performance here to justify the added price increase. The new base, even with the value of the added 20% more product in the CK6 tub factored out, is still $7 more per tub than the CK line. And, as mentioned, the scents are all the same price, (save for Sangre De Drago which is $29, due to all the alleged fancy ingredients in it), so it's not like the added cost for SSS is due to scent ingredients used.\n* $15 for the CK base was tempting, a snake with a shiny, sweet apple, but $25 for CK6 is like that same snake offering one a battered old potato covered in dirt. The path to virtue is rarely easier to travel!\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​",

Feel like I can still hone my technique with the shavette on days where I don't have time to strop and care for my straights. TNeV could be the best smelling soap out there. I had only tried a sample before getting the full size tub from the Maggard's restock last week. Noble Otter has sprinted to the top of my list.\n\nEveryone needs some more Swedish Death Metal in their life and Soilwork is one of the best!",

I have Ghost Town Barber to go through then I might pick up a full tub, Cryogen is in the lead at the moment.",

My initial reaction upon applying the splash was [kinda like](https://imgix.bustle.com/2017/5/24/237e1ca6-44ff-4326-a5fb-9d4bea32eb4e.png?w=970&h=546&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format&q=70) because the scent sharply transitioned from the chocolate cake of scrum to rich leather and tobacco of fenchurch - not good. Then fenchurch calmed down a bit, and bits of chocolate peak through and it is quite complementary indeed. Nearly an hour later, and I still get a bit of the complementary chocolate and it's pretty good. Better than the fen on fen on fen? Maybe, but I think for me that initial jarring transition makes it an overall less enjoyable experience. I don't think I'm going to completely write off this whole wild and raucous scent pairing idea, but I think on the regular I'm more of a missionary through the pouch hole with the lights off kind of guy.\n\nSide note, yesterday was one of my favorite days on the sub ever despite missing my lollipop shave. Huge thanks to everyone who participated in the jokes and made an otherwise hectic, busy, miserable Monday actually quite enjoyable.",

And Jacinthe is great, so I'm off to a great start on a day off.\n\n\n*The song:* It was on my mind since yesterday. Going to throw the full album on while I do my house work today. Sun Kil Moon covering Modest Mouse. The album is called *Tiny Cities.*\n\n\n*Question:* Is there an artisan brushmaker that keeps an inventory?

I can say the only thing about the soap is that the post-shave feel isn't as good as some 'elite' soaps out there... That said I still didn't use any post-shave product and didn't have any issues.\n\nThe Voshkod blade is getting better every shave - it cuts well but is not irritating my skin anymore.\n\nGreat shave day again.\n\nHappy Tuesday folks!",

I have 2 soaps with similar scents so I'm trying to decide between the 2 on which to keep. I used the SV and B-400 on my left side and the Route 66 and WildWest on my right. I prefer the scent of the Route 66 barely over the SV but it's close. Both easily lathered up however the SV produced a more stable lather; the Route 66 was thinner and bubbly while the SV was thick and creamy. Both offered good protection, glide and had enough residual slickness to allow for buffering. The alum was the deciding factor. It was completely silent on the SV side but there was a slight burn on the Route 66 side. In the fairness of science I'm going to repeat this shave but change sides and brushes before I make the final decision however this round goes to Saponificio Varesino. Have a great day folks!\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/AWA7CyX",

This razor looks even better in person. It's amazing how they were able to make the usually massive GEM head look small. How does it compare to the Streamline? I'm not sure yet. I did get an excellent shave this morning. Sometimes the first use of a GEM blade is rough for me, but that was not the case today. This Sabre does have the more mild plate, which made this shave seem almost fool proof.",

Just wow. I have so much to say. First time using Night Music and there's so much to digest. The scent is definitely a stinky one. Like realllyyyy stinky. I definitely get the smell that it's a little bit like poop, but that little vanilla and strawberry saves it. I had 3 people walk by while I was shaving with it. My friends girlfriend said it smelled like straight shit, my friend said it smells good just way too fruity, and my other friend walked in and said \"man it smells good in here\". I think that sums up this scent. I will say, the aftershave is the star of this scent. To me, the scent is totally different, it's much more vanilla/strawberryey and is absolutely amazing. The soap has a much more \"poopy\" scent to it. Quite the shave\n\nThis was also the best lather I've gotten from glissant, resulted in an excellent shave\n\nHappy Tuesday everyone",

My first time using a B&M product and I can definitely say the hype was justified. I got a little careless with my shave this morning and had a few minor nicks but I dont think the soap was to blame for those. Still trying to figure out what my preferred blade is but I'll be going back through my sampler here soon, Polisilver is currently the leader in the clubhouse. Have some NO soaps to try out here soon as well, did a test lather last night and I can already tell it's a great product.",

It's a nice cologne dupe, not too strong. I really appreciate the sample because I couldn't find it anywhere and wanted to try it. It's a good soap and now I can stop wondering.\n\nStirling is a good baseline reset for me. I'm going to use this brush for a while and wanted to kind of zero my routine out.\n\nThe Magic Razor is coming along nicely and I'm going to try some different blades. The Gem Junior is my favorite razor at the moment. I'm really enjoying it.\n\nOn another note, I was cleaning a razor and dropped it into a Ball jar of alcohol, which turned out to be a jar of coconut oil. I should label stuff. At least I have a well lubed razor.\n\nHave a great day!",

The head angle reminds me of the wings, and the grooved tapered barrel handle reminds me of the fuselage. I was told by Mr. Blacklands himself that this is merely the power of my imagination, and that only the Blackbird is supposed to look like an actual flying thingie. OK, but as Galileo said under his breath, it still looks like a damn F-86 to me.\n* The Sabre shaves very well, maybe the king of GEMs for the spendier types. Unlike the vintages, the Sabre can go ATG all day without even a hint of chatter due to the modern standard blade retention (no vintage aging springs here!). The Level I head is pretty useless, but the Level II, with it's 0.95 gap, is very efficient and yet very comfy.\n* You do have to get the angle right though - unlike DEs and many recent AC blade designs, you cannot really use a 30 degree angle, but have to hold the blade much flatter against your face. Looks rather like some tomahawk action in use!\n* Anyway, very smooth, highly efficient, no issue getting BBS. Shows the power of a good SE, and may or may not be worth the added cost to GEM fans. My Flying Wing gives 75% as good a shave for 25% of the price, but ATG on the upper lip for me with any vintage GEM is a PITA, so the Sabre is almost worth the cost for that alone. Plus it looks like the F-86!\n* **Soap:** Yup, the CK base is no joke. After yesterday's CK6 trial, I wanted to go back and revisit the cheaper base, and it impressed me again in a way the CK6 did not. CK is a $15 base that performs like a $20 base; CK6 is a $25 base that performs like that same $20 base. Lovely complex layered vetiver scent here also!",

It took a lot of water, and I probably could have given it a bit more if I had been lathering in a bowl. I may have under-loaded the soap (or else my SOC hogged some of it--will try a synthetic brush tomorrow). Very protective lather with lots of cushion and glide. To get BBS around my goatee area I often need to do some additional buffing, and this soap was very accommodating. As far as scent I get mostly a sweet, tropical note. The mango is dominant to my nose with the other citrus playing more of a supporting role. I'd consider this a unisex scent. I didn't get much for floral notes in the soap--but did notice them more in the dry-down on the aftershave. When I applied the splash, my first whiff reminded me of being in Hawaii. I didn't get any alcohol burn, but I did experience some of the \"hot face\" feel that u/Cadinsor described in his recent review--similar (but less severe) to my experience with Declaration Sellout splash. It passed in about 5 mins, and my skin felt nice after, but perhaps a tad less moisturizing than my favorite splashes from CFG (which also have a hint of menthol that I've come to really enjoy). Anyway I give the soap very high marks for performance, and the scent is pleasant and unique vs. other things I have in my collection. I think I would enjoy the splash more if it managed to work in a hint of menthol to give more of a cooling sensation.",

I went to the address and it was just a dude selling stuff out of his underground garage. Picked up a cheap Haslinger puck and also a budget lotion. The soap is practically scentless but gives a comfy layer and soothes the skin. My skin after the shave was very smooth, not quite BBS but that's more on me.\n\nFirst time trying a soap, don't have a bowl to keep the puck on so the loading was a bit awkward but it was a step up from my EJ shaving cream nonetheless. Looking forward to other shaves!",

Otherwise, this was a superb shave. Knocked down about 10 days worth of growth without much issue. Needed to go slow and do a couple more wtg strokes here and there to make up for my lapse in shaving.\n\nThis was my second Vokshod blade and I'm loving them so far. I only got a couple shaves out of the first one, but I have yet to get beyond 3 shaves with any blade. Like these blades so much so that I decided to pull the trigger on a 100 pack of them this morning.",

Kai wasn't all that smooth. Even though the Bronze has been working well with just about every blade I've got. And jumped back into Chiseled Face GTB, and was reminded how great their base is.\n\n#### ❧ Razor and Blade Notes\n\n*^(Timeless - Bronze .38 Solid Bar ::: Kai ‹3 uses›)*\n\nOkay combo, but many blades are better. Wonder if this guy will smooth out with some more uses.\n\nNo tugging or irritation.\n\n#### ❧ Soap Notes\n\n*^(Chiseled Face - Ghost Town Barber)*\n\n33 second load with lightly-wet backboney boar brush + 3.5 tsp water = 5-6 passes of creamy, slick, beautiful lather.\n\nScent: Yep, a warm twist on your traditional barbershop. I like it. Paired well with PDP 63 balm.\n\nScent Strength: 7/10, very present during shaving. But I didn't find it overwhelming. I wonder if I would if I used it every day. I mainly enjoyed the strength; so rare these days.\n\nBowl - I used the XL version of this bowl:\nhttps://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3392930\n\n#### ❧ Brush Notes\n\n*^(Omega - 10098 Boar ‹11 uses›)*\n\na little prickly, but generally okay. Not really comfy yet.\n\n#### ❧ Shave Quality *During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: A little irritating\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Cut flush to where I just see the tips (above average for me)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm)\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

I have two that I switch between and neither one ever seems sharp enough to go ATG. WTG works very well and usually only nick myself when I don't pay enough attention. ATG doesn't get very close at all and causes a lot of irritation. I'm not completely throwing in the towel, but I enjoy this hobby way too much to put up with inferior shaves.\n\nA fitting song for the caller's I've had at work lately.

Gave it a chance in my Super Speed, which tends to not tolerate dull blades. It felt noticeably duller today and the shave was just barely tolerable. These felt better than Derby Extra but they're nowhere near good enough to be worth using. Into the bin it goes.\n\nStarting to get the hang of face lathering now that I have a brush that's soft enough for it. My Horse and giant Badger/Boar brush are both too scritchy and give me wicked brush burn, but this Maggard synth works pretty well. I like the texture of my wife's 30mm SynBad better but it's too big for my face, so last week I finally broke down and ordered a Yaqi Moka Express (24mm version of same knot, afaik) to match my coffee pot. Hopefully it'll show up mid-April.\n\nSeville provided a lovely shave experience (as is expected). The rosemary and patchouli left-overs after the shave were stronger today than the previous times I've used it, but still subtle enough that the coworkers stuck in the car all day with me won't notice it. Hitting the highway for another road trip with my project manager to visit some of the stores we have under construction right now... We'll be putting about 1,100 km of road behind us before the day is done. Saskatoon to Lloydminster to Edmonton and back in a day, leaving at 6 am and getting home close to midnight.

To the point where when I smell it in real life I think of the soap, which is some Baudrillard level post-modernism, but there you go.\n\nWhy one would want to smell like dirt-in-rain I'm not sure. But it is a fascinating work of art to nail this scent so perfectly.",

      "body": "Wednesday 4/3 SOTD\n\n* Razor: Blacklands Sabre GEM with L 2 plate\n* Blade: GEM PTFE (2)\n* Brush: Elite 26mm Manchurian bulb in jasper stone handle\n* Soap: Crown King Sun Down CK base\n* Post: Cremo Cooling Post Shave balm\n* Frag: Lauder Aramis EDT\n\nProduct Notes:\n\n* **Soap:** Sympathy For The Devil Week continues with SmytHodges' interpretation of short lived Gillette aftershave Sun Up (note the immense cleverness used in his alternate titling of the product). The Gillette scent was the olfactory model for B&M's \"Classic\" Reserve scent, also, and (surprise!) the two projects turned out quite differently.\n* B&M Classic is a rather delicate subtle scent. [Sun Down](https://phoenixartisanaccoutrements.com/products/sun-down-artisan-shave-soap-crown-king-formula) is garish, loud, and bombastic. I've never smelled Sun Up, but if I had to guess, I would say the latter set of characteristics would probably be what I would most associate with mass marketed Gillette masculine scentage.\n* But Sun Down has a problem, one that shows the human side of The Lord of Darkness. I can appreciate this problem, because I've designed my own perfume one time. You're trying to duplicate a certain scent, and you get most of it, but, there's an unpleasant stray note in there. You try and try to remix things - adding, subtracting, reducing, increasing -- and that damned stray note just stays there.\n* Now if you are a professional perfumer, and / or a genius, you keep on working at it till the undesired scent goes away. But if you are me (or, apparently, SmytHodges) you just say \"aw, screw it, it's good enough\" and pronounce your efforts concluded.\n* For Sun Down, this means --- pennies! Yes indeed, Sun Down smells more like copper than my copper ATT Windsor does. The note is quite noticeable, is smelled all through the shave, and I can't say I find it all that pleasant. It's not awful, and I actually rather like the bolder scent strength of Sun Down Vs Reserve Classic, but the feeling that I'm rubbing penny paste on my face is pretty off-putting.\n* Assuming one does not mind the copper scent (or does not notice it - maybe I have a bad tub, maybe others' noses would not pick up the note as keenly as I do) - the CK base performs excellently, with fine glide and protection, and above average post shave. I would actually rank the CK base higher than Glissant and Noble Otter tallows, certainly a great vegan base, and at a very reasonable price point of under $4 an ounce.\n* PAA is still selling scents in the old base for a bit, and as the new CK6 base is underwhelming in terms of value, and comparable in performance to the old base, I would suggest those interested in trying the output of the brand start here before $25 becomes the new entry point for PAA / CK soaps. You may want to avoid Sun Down though. At least unless you really liked the smells involved in emptying out your piggy bank when you were a kid!",

He said a few of them are weird scents. Most are labeled, but this one I can't seem to find. I think it's \"42.\"\n\nSmeared it in my mug and it lathered up really easily. The scent is overwhelmingly spring flowers at first, and then I got a whiff of something that reminds me strongly of a gift store near where I live. I'm really struggling with how to describe that place, but it's packed with fresh flowers and sells gifts for women, with a lot of competing scents going on in there. This definitely hit the weird mark.",

I didn't load hard on the cute tub but think perhaps I didn't add enough water. It was slick but not as greasy as Wholly Kaw or Declaration Grooming soaps. It was closer to a B&M Reserve level which, like I said, leads me to believe I used too little water. The post shave has been nice and the splash didn't light me up at all, which shocked me because often alcohol only splashes are too harsh for my mug. The scent was pleasant but hasn't stuck with me all day like I was hoping. I'm wondering if lavander is an essential oil that is highly volatile and so doesn't stick around or if there's a way to bump this up. I may try a sample of Lavande Poivre at Shawn's drop if I can get enough signal to elbow my way in with the rest of you well shaven handsome animals...",

I delayed shaving with the razor as there is a bit of an [alignment issue](https://i.imgur.com/aBMU6wO.jpg) with one of the doors, making the blade exposure uneven (gap is wider at the top). However, I couldn't wait any longer to test it out. Wow. I gotta say I'm really excited to be a part of the Rockwell Owners Club (if that's a real thing?), and aside from the alignment problem, which may have caused me to nick my ankle, the rest of the shave was pretty phenomenal. The razor looks bad ass, great audio feedback and I love the weight. Sad that there was a QC issue with my razor, but I hope the rest of the ones sent out are in better condition.\n\nAmazing scent from Eleven's Lime & Basil. The basil doesn't really come out until you lather, but it is a nice surprise. Took a while to get a good lather, but was rewarded for my patience.\n\nHappy hump day! :)",

Not to mention it does the job admirably.\n\nSo, my first experience with Talbot Shaving. Is it worth the hype?\n\nThe scent is delightful, though relatively straightforward. As others have noted this is dominated by a sharp, not-at-all-sweet lavender note. Rosemary is more of a footnote here, but it lends some herbal depth which is a nice counterpoint to the lavender.\n\nThe Marco Method seems tailor-made for a soap base like this. In no time the soap soaked up all of the water and rewarded me with a dense, incredibly slick lather. Three passes on my face and and one pass on my neck - slickness and cushion is on par with the best I've ever tried. I don't do any kind of buffing so residual slickness doesn't mean much to me, but there was plenty as I ran my fingers across my face following the first pass.\n\nAs for the post shave, I did a test lather on my palm as a control. It left my skin feeling like I had used some of my girlfriend's bougie hand lotion. Smooth, supple, and nourished. I know the skin on my hand is completely different, but my face is too sensitive to risk forgoing a post-shave treatment.\n\nMont Ventoux offered the perfect springboard to CL's Champs de Lavande aftershave. The splash brings a much more complex aroma, with lavender, black pepper, and rosemary serving as the primary notes in that order. The lavender here is similarly sharp and masculine, harmoniously piggybacking off the soap.\n\nWhat I wished MV offered in complexity is more than compensated for with this splash. I don't need to preach to the choir regarding the post-shave feel of CL's aftershaves, but it seems like the perfect recipe for my skin. Many splashes make my skin thirsty while most balms end up making it feel greasy. This leaves it on the drier end of moisturized. It's perfect considering I manage a restaurant, where running a floor in a suit can cause me to sweat.\n\nWith this particular combo, I think I've found my go-to soap and splash pairing for the spring.\n",

This was one of the first full size soaps that I bought and was very disappointed. I didn't like the scent off of the puck and had a terrible time lathering it. The lather was very soup like and would not wash off my razor. Fast forward a year and I could argue that this is the best base out there. I was loading way too much soap with not enough water. Bad combination for any soap. Also, the scent opens up when lathered, but I started to appreciate the simplicity of the scent. Adding any sandalwood based aftershave and EdP is a perfect compliment.\n\nKeeping with the theme, Meshuggah is a band that I simply did not understand when I first heard them. After seeing them live at Ozzfest in the early 2000's, I came to appreciate how great they are. This song is what I play when I really need to calm down. Yes, metal calms me down.",

Floral and fruity, it is described as having notes of bergamot, lilac, rose, peach and violet.\n\nAccording to Executive Shaving:\n\n>The Barocco shaving cream is named after the plant Bacopa Monnieri, also known as Bacopa, Brahmi and Waterhyssop. Along with Shea Butter, Rose Muscheta Oil, the extract from this plant is a fundamental component of this shaving cream. The plant extract is used in cosmetics and face creams for its anti-inflammatory and anti-wrinkle properties. This makes the Barocco shaving cream very good for delicate skin.\n\nWhich I guess is how they justify charging more for it than other Extrò croaps ̄\\_(ツ)_/ ̄\n\nMy experience: it produces a great lather with not much effort with a pleasant floral scent. Would I buy a full tub? Probably not. Instead I'm going to keep kissing frog samples until I find my prince sample!",

Breezy, with a west wind 15 to 25 mph, with gusts as high as 40 mph. High tide at 11:42 this morning.\n\nTrying to be on theme today. Dance of Agrumes was bought because I had just picked up Martin de Candre - Agrumes and loved the smell of that, so I bought Dance of Agrumes thinking it would be similar. I was sorely disappointed. It might have been that initial disappointment that set me to not really liking it, or at least not reaching for it. I have grown to like it since I've gotten it, but it really hasn't seen much use as the top of the soap still feels like it does when you just open a new tub and you have the fresh pour top.\n\nShave was excellent. As this is the only Wholly Kaw soap that I own and the aforementioned reasoned for why I don't pull it out that often, I completely forgot how great this base it. Nice slick, and dense lather. Might have to pick some more up at a later date.\n\nThe Balm goes on a bit greasy, but does wonders for the skin. I still prefer Dapper Dragon's Scale Polish and Declaration Grooming's liniment, but it is definitely Number 3 on the list.\n\nHave a nice Thursday everyone!",

Since we still don't have a drag to match, I tossed on some Biblio. Much to my amazement, it all changed and morphed into something greater than its individual parts and I'll most definitely be revisiting this combination regularly.",

Third shave with the 7 o'clock blades, and so far I really haven't been impressed. They aren't removing as much hair in one go as a Feather, and they're not as smooth as a Silver Blue.\n\nThe soap was kind of weird too. It didn't lather up very thick (usually I can just layer Cella on my face like it was meringue), but what lather there was was very slick and cushioning. Aftershave was kind of drying, even with the Thayers applied first, and it's actually not that close to the cologne scent-wise.\n\nAs a punchline to the joke, when my package came in, I realized I had ordered the Fine Italian Citrus instead of the L'orange Noir. I did get a package from Stirling in too, so I guess I'll roll with that tomorrow.",

A bit cool this morning with a chance of rain so I went with a scent to fit that. This Bufflehead has a bit more green grass and springtime scent to it than I remembered, it was pleasant. I was planning on using Tobacco Vanille today so I went with Clubman Vanilla. It smells nothing like OG Clubman nor do I even detect vanilla in it. It didn't mix particularly well with the soap either. Then I remembered just how cold weather of a scent TV is so I decided to go a different route, but still wanting vanilla (to match the Clubman that had no discernible vanilla), I sprang from MoaT. That was yet another odd and clashing combination. Oh well, as I type this all those wack smell combinations are gone and I'm left only with MoaT which smells better than I remember. That combination of vanilla and oak is very nice and comforting - just enough dry spice to offset the sweetness of the vanilla.\n\nKid wouldn't sleep last night so I'm expecting to crash midday today. Have a good Thursday everyone! And yes, I did forget to check the theme again...",

All of these products I did not like when I first used them. I orginally did not like my tech because I didn't know where the blade was. Once my technique got good, I learned to love this thing, and is now the only razor I use. I hated Voskhods, thought they were too sharp, but now are in my top 5 blades cuz technique. Baker Street I was originally unsure of, but again learned to appreciate. Also the reserve seville aftershave has grown on me since the last use.\n\nThe main piece of gear that fits the theme is the brush. I *hated* this brush when I first used it. It just ate lather and it was not comfortable. Now with about a dozen more uses on it, it is one of, if not my favorite brush.\n\nI did two things that were quite dumb yesterday. I started the day by dropping my phone, and now the screen won't turn on. Now I'm looking at paying $170 to repair a $200 phone, and I am also phoneless. This broke college kid just got broker. Then, keeping with my personal theme of dropping things, I dropped the brush into my sink full of water before my second pass, which made me have to reload once again. At least its almost Friday\n\nHappy shaves everyone!",

This time I decided to keep going with more water to get a much better lather. Considering I didn't have a shower before hand, I was impressed with smooth the shave felt.\n\nThe post shave feel is actually really good. Skin felt moisturized and the AS just added some skin food that completed the experience very well.\n\nBlade is still performing very well. This is a good blade for me once the initial sharpness is mellowed a little bit.\n\nHave a good Thursday folks!",

This was my first shave with a NO soap and the scent is fantastic on this one. Lather was easy to dial and offered plenty of protection. The Astra blades weren't my favorite my first time through the sampler but wanted to give them another go. Don't think they're going to end up making the cut. I'm probably between GSB, Voskhod or Polisilver at this point so will need to give them each another go before buying a larger number of blades.\n",

Received a little bit of the aftershave as a generous PIF from u/Mesingw and thought it smelled terrible. I was actually dreading having to try it, but also knew that scents are not something u/Mesingw plays around with and that if he sent it to me then it must be good. I ordered a sample of the soap to go with it because I had nothing that seemed even remotely similar to pair with it and gave it a go once it arrived. It was the biggest transformation of something that on first sniff almost made me want to throw it away immediately; it blooms into this amazing scent that leaves me wanting more (I could bathe in the stuff and be perfectly happy). That's my take on it at least, anyone else tried it and thought something similar?\n",

The last B&M whimsical literary crossover, \"42\" was not to my taste. I am no Dr. Seuss fan, preferring the cannibalism, depravity, and dark violence of The Brothers Grimm as far as kids' lit goes. My childhood smelled not of tangerines, towels , and cookies but rather of hot plastic, nicotine, and pork chops. I don't like sweet scents in the least. This did not seem like a scent I would much like.\n* **Soap:** But I forgot about Latha Limon. B&M can put out hellaciously good cheap scents when they try, and Limon was a great one - citrus and rose. That same concept is seen in Whatsis, but with grapefruit replacing the lemon from the earlier Latha scent. And that wonderful rose note is back, crisply floral, not too sweet. I also recognize the towel note as one of the many scent elements of RIMC, another great B&M scent, and the cookie note from Dickens. Put all this together and one has an amazingly appealing and perfectly balanced scent. This cheap little scent is the sign of a master at work, taking inexpensive synthetic scent chemicals and creating a mini-masterpiece.\n* Performance? Well. it's Excelsior, the slightly poor man's Reserve. This is one of the five bases in the Top Three list, and even a dedicated Reserve fan like myself admits that Excelsior comes very, very close to being the best in the game. Lather formation is even easier than Reserve, glide roughly the same, protection and post shave only slightly inferior.\n* The value element of this composition needs to be mentioned also. In a world where even PAA soap costs $25 and many brands are coming even closer to $30 a tub, it is both amazing and encouraging that B&M can offer a top notch base featuring a great scent for $17. Latha is gone, but Whatsis shows B&M can crank out a \"value line\" anytime they might want to do so.\n* Icing on the cake: Missus Malthus actually liked this scent. The only other B&M soap scents she's liked have been Petrichor and Diamond, so this is an odd trio indeed. When I told her it was a Dr. Seuss tribute, she said she could perceive the connection between theme and scent. My daughter liked it too, but then I think she inherited my weird ass sense of scent aesthetics - she even likes Fougere Gothique! And Night Music...\n* **Brush:** Jeffy's perfect as usual. For 180 clams, he ought to be! : D\n* **Frag:** Love this scent, but based on the mysterious Azzaro price increase on AMZ and elsewhere recently, the now much cheaper Lauder scent \"Tuscany\", perilously close to being an APH dupe, now seems much more appealing. The two smell very similar to me!\n\n​\n\n​\n\n",

The performance is absolutely top tier (although I'm not at all surprised since this is the buffala base). The fragrance reminds me a bit of the Project Leather soap (another WK offering), but without the leather suede. It's super complex for a shave soap, and I'm not sure that I really got the full effect from the soap sample...I suspect that the complexities are more distinct and balanced in the aftershave.\n\nGiven my strong preference for the King of Bourbon line, this probably isn't a soap where I'd buy a full set. However, this is quite nice and I have a feeling people who wear a lot of dark leather scents will probably find that this is a very nice complimentary shave.",

Well, turns out, it calms down a bit once you put it on and with the added menthol it feels excellent on a hot day. As for the lather, when I first tried the shaving stick of this (for now I have a tube of the cream) I hated it not because of the scent, but because every time I used it I would get cut up bad. Well, over time, I figured out that being used to Arko and it being a harder soap, I was just under loading so now that we have that fixed, this has become one of my fav non-artesian soaps.",

I bought it on release and enjoyed it. After a while, I thought there was something about it that just wasn't doing it for me and I put it away.\n\nNow that spring is here and it's warmed up, I tried it again and loved it. Something about that ozone, rain and earth scent on a warm Spring day just feels right. And that cold splash is going to be great in summer. It reminds me of hiking by water.",

      "body": "Last night's shave -\n\n**Razor:** EJ DE89\n\n**Blade:** Vokshod (2)\n\n**Brush:** Yaqi Mysterious Space Timberwolf\n\n**Lather:** SW Tres Matres\n\n**Post Shave:** Witch Hazel\n\nI've been using the Yaqi brush a lot lately, but I'm still in the process of trying to love it. For one, I am generally not thinking ahead and forget to soak my boar brush. Secondly, I didn't really love the Yaqi at first and so I'm trying to get used to it. I like the bit of scritch from my boar brush, but I think the biggest problem I have with the Yaqi is that it is too springy or maybe there is too much backbone? I'm not sure which, but it just seems difficult to get it to splay and scrub properly when I'm building a lather. Especially so when I'm face lathering.\n\nThe shave itself was really good; although it didn't seem quite as comfortable or smooth as the second shave I got out of a Vokshod on the Gillette Tech. Seemed a bit off overall and had to do some extra passes on my neck to get everything. Also ended up with some more irritation than normal all around which is pretty strange. I'm wondering if shaving off over a week of growth last time dinged up this blade more than normal for one shave. Either way I will be swapping it out after this shave.",

I thought about bringing a bunch of samples but instead I decided I wanted to focus on one soap for this week. All of the shaves this week were thanks to /u/Ugmug\n\nFor those of you that don't know, Ugmug was the one who coaxed me into posting regularly on /r/WetShaving. During the government shutdown he gifted me with this set of Philips Fougere and then later sent me the Stirling Finest Badger.\n\nPhilips Fougere is vegan based soap. Unlike a lot of vegan soaps that I've owned, this one is pretty soft. I think that's due to the coconut. I love Fougere and this is a green, clean fresh smelling Fougère. It's not floral or dark. It's closer to Stirling Sharp Dressed Man than it is B&M Beaudelaire. It's not a fragrance style Fougere, just clean and green.\n\nI've used this BSG soap for 20ish shaves at this point. The soap likes water and responds well to a little blooming. It can face lather easily with a damp badger and the cushion is good. Slickness is medium but the real star is the smell.\n\nIn other news, last night I went to Disneyland for the first time as an adult. I've taken my kids to Disney World before, but this was different. I got off work at 2pm, grabbed the car and was at the park by four. I did single rider for everything and hit all the rides that are difficult to do with children in tow. I ate some great food and had a really good time. I stayed until 11:15 and was able to be back at my hotel by midnight.\n\nI'm traveling back home on Friday and with that, I'll resume my photos. Cheers!\n\nHave a good Thursday!\n\nRobot",

I've had to really work at learning to lather this base but as we head into the summer I think it's going to pay off for me. Also when I use these two scents I honestly don't know which one I like more. My opinion often swaps back and forth. I really appreciate how the Chestnut and 88, a neroli and citrus scent, has that sharp top note like an orange blossom and ruby grapefruit had a love child. Seville smells less organic and more cologne like for me but it also strikes me as especially clean. At the end of day I'm lucky to be able to shave with this gear and selfishly hope the artisans keep pushing the bar. I'd love to have more dilemmas like this one.",

Two pass + Two clean ups. WTG, XTG/ATG, and two clean ups. Irritation-free shave but no BBS. I've been craving the BBS recently but with the Gillette Tech, it is very hard to get a BBS. Maybe I'll try a different blade but I always seem to have some slight stubbles left.\n\n**The Soap** was good. I'm now used to the basil-forward scent and it gives a good lather for the shave. However, it does feel like it's missing that extra oomph. Maybe it's my brush or technique but I'm not getting the creamy lather but more of a thinner lather. I will try again next time to get a better lather.\n\n**The Razor and Blade** combination was good. Nothing to complain about except that I cannot take off that last ATG stubbles. I buffed some areas but the razor is a bit too mild to take those off. I'll give it couple more tries but for me, I use them for a comfortable shave, not a BBS shave.\n\n**The Brush** was very nice. It has good amount of backbone and soft scritch to exfoliate the skin. It does eat up the lather more than other brushes. I just need to load more soap to compensate for that. Other than that, it performed well and continues to do so.\n\n**The aftershave portion** was great. Mild toning with the WH and ice cold sensation coming from the Duke Cannon's Balm. Wonderful.\n\nOverall, an enjoyable shave. Comfortable and irritation-free. I'll load more soap next time with the Semogue 1250 and experiment with the angle of the Gillette Tech to get a closer shave.",

I have been using badger knots almost exclusively lately after picking up my first Declaration Grooming knot and I must be getting better with the lathering. I soak my brush while I'm in the shower then I lather with the Marco Method. This dense 30mm felt great on the face and produced enough lather for 4 passes if I were so inclined. It really is a great value for around $50 on Ebay. Necromantic is just such a great scent. If you haven't tried any of Southern Witchcrafts yet, do yourself a favor and pick up at least a sample of this one. One of the best values in wet shaving and if you wouldn't have told me, I never would have guessed it was a vegan base. Shout out to the aftershave, it's by far my favorite non-alcohol based post product. Scent lasts for a few hours as well.\n\nIron Maiden, perfect compliment to this shave today!",

My first run with Sweet Lemon and the Icarus Base. Since it came in Wednesday, I've been opening the tub randomly throughout the day just to take a whiff.\n\nThe main scent I pull from this is the coconut. I didn't get any of the lemon scent in the lather. The splash gave me a fleeting lemon scent before turning back into coconut. Maybe as I use this more, the lemon will be more present.\n\nAs for the lather, Icarus is really good. I like to think I have a good grasp on WK and can dial it in easily. Icarus is tougher to dial in, but the lather is top notch even when not perfect. Good cushion and glide for sure.\n\nI'm looking forward to using this more and seeing how much better I can get with the Icarus base.\n\nHappy Friday!",

Two passes straight down.\n\nGot the Stirling in a mail shipment this week; I 3017'd a jar of this a few years back and was always meaning to re-up. Doesn't lather up as well as my Cella, but the glide is excellent. Soap smells and feels great on the skin.\n\nBought the aftershave earlier this week from IB. I was meaning to get the L'Orange Noir, as I also bought RR Son of Zeus soap and aftershave, and was wanting to see how the two compared to the Terre D'Hermes scent. Still, the Italian Citrus is a good smell, and I love the menthol kick from Fine.\n\nFine has switched bottles since the last time I bought from them; the new bottle has rounded shoulders and a square bottom, as opposed to the old ones that looked like half-pint liquor bottles. It kind of reminds me of the original square bottles.",

I know the F1 base isn't the best, but it lathered up easily and was just perfect for a neck cleanup. Finished off with the matching splash because that's more my steelo, but not having a matching splash meant I had to reach for something else. Couldn't go too bright or dark with temps in the mid 50s, so opted for 13. Kind of clashy and weird but whatevs.\n\nHappy Friday!",

It lathers beautifully and performs like every other Chiseled Face soap I've used. Great slickness and protection. The aftershave has a decent shot of menthol in it which kicks in almost immediately after application. And u/chiseledface is right, it's not nice. It's a smack in the face with a fresh banana scent that's not in the realm of artificial banana like runts or something like that.",

      "body": "**2019-04-05 SOTD**\n\n**Prep:** Took a warm shower, shaved with cool water\n\n**Brush:** Maggard 24mm blond Synthetic\n\n**Lather:** B&M Reserve Cool\n\n**Razor:** 1955 Ball-end Tech\n\n**Blade:** Lord Classic (shave #1)\n\n**Post:** Stirling Unscented Post-Shave Balm\n\n**Thoughts:**\n\nTime to try another cheap blade with cute packaging: Lord Classic. Probably my favorite branding on a box of blades. So cute. I had pretty low expectations for the actual performance of this blade, but it was actually a very nice shave! Very smooth, BBS finish almost everywhere, no irritation in problem patches. I'm curious to see how it'll handle in my other razors and how long it will last.\n\nTried building my entire lather on my face today with Reserve, based on a video somebody suggested I watch. Not a big fan of this technique... it's tougher for me to work the water into the lather when it's on my face than when I'm building it on my hand or in a bowl. I had to use a bowl for my second and third passes and there was much less soap left over than usual because so much of it was on my face for the first pass. On the up side, though, I finally nailed the soap:water ratio and got that creamy, opaque, thin layer of soap that I always envy in Ruds''s's'z videos. I think I know what to aim for now, so I'll give it a shot again with my lather bowl on the weekend and see if I replicate my success without building the lather on my face.\n\nSpeaking of soap, frikkity frak does Cool ever smell good. Last time I used it I was sort of \"hmm, this stuff is pretty nice I guess,\" but this time it was more of a \"daaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaamn.\" I think I need to buy a tub of it. I'm not convinced I could handle the scent all day though so I'll probably ignore the cologne.",

Maybe I should just save them for LG though on second thought. Anyway, great shave today with SW as it never disappoints. I busted out the V3A for the first time in while and got pretty damn close to BBS in 2 passes with zero issues. Great razor especially for the price. I usually shave in silence, but I see a lot of you all posting tunes lately so I decided to put some on this morning. Great song from my favorite band. Happy Friday everyone!\n\n​",

Its been an absolute pain trying to move around but I am finally able to put some weight on it. So I finally got to get a shave in and it felt good. It's amazing how much just getting cleaned up can make you feel better.",

I don't think I'm that kind of person. Variation is the spice of life and there's so many good soaps out there to use, I think it would take something very special to settle on just one.\n\nI'm still in LA and today is my last day here. It's been a great trip but I'm looking forward to getting home. I have some new soaps I traded for waiting for me and I owe some soaps to others in exchange and I need to get them out in the mail tomorrow. I'm looking toward to getting back to my photos as well. It's been nice to take a breather but I'm ready to try back to it.\n\nI had a good conversation about Lavender and Sandwood soaps yesterday. I think I'm going to try hunting down some unobtainium in the form of some Llahi Ridge from Talbots. I also heard some good things recently about Dapper Dragon Lavender Lizard. Both were highly recommended. Anyone here comment?\n\nFor those of you that have killed off a tub by just focusing on it to the exclusion of your other soaps, what soap was it?\n\nHave a great Friday!\n\nRobot",

I've shaved with Flying Hide, Nectar Amissa, Texaus, and Two Kings this week. I've also used The Noir et Vanille, Barrbarr, and Monarch. So I guess I just need to try Lonestar and I've been through Cody's whole normal lineup, I think. If anyone has a sample, let me know!\n\nThe performance of their V2 base is stellar. The slickness and post shave are both top notch, IMO. And when I like Cody's scents, I love them. The Trail is probably my favorite, then TNeV and Barrbarr. They're all very different scents, and it is impressive that he can nail so many different genres. I actually like all of the NO scents I've tried, but I've Two Kings and Texaus to be a little too lightly scented for my preference, and while Flying Hide isn't really for me I can see why others love it. So I'll likely be moving those soaps soon. I still need to pick up a Barrbarr set in the current base.\n\nThis was my first time using the H1 head from ATT. It was pretty dang efficient. A little on the aggressive side for me, but the fact that I've shaved every day for five days straight may have been a factor. It was a very close shave with one small weeper on my chin and maybe a little razor burn on my jawline next to my chin. We'll see if that irritation actually manifests, but it felt pretty raw after the shave.",

Anyway, back to logging data for /u/Ythin and his excellent work (with /u/MadDingersYo) on collecting, analyzing and reporting on shavestats for the sub.\n\nA few weekends ago, it became clear to me that winter has come and gone (contrary to what GoT S8 would have you believe)... with that said, I figured no better way to celebrate better weather than my favorite summer scent of all time, Shore. For anyone not familiar with it, this was one of the first offerings in Declaration Grooming's Icarus base: the fragrance is IMHO a well blended mix of what summers growing up in the LBC was for me (sand, sea spray, sunblock, surfboards, beach towels, and good times with friends and family around the fire pit by tower 12 at Bolsa Chica), and the post-shave quality is elite tier, bar none. Using this soap always takes me back to my hometown and my favorite memories with sun and surf, and it was my first favorite soap from DG.\n\nUsed Shore on the dome for a head shave and on face for everything else (except the stash, gotta grow it back in)... and now I'm ready for a fantastic weekend.\n\nHope everyone has good shaves and a great weekend!",

Ever since I've discovered Wizamet Iridium Super Extra Stainless I don't ever feel any urge to go back to the blades I used previously...unless I'm being lazy and don't want to clean off the wax. This is such an instance. I'm getting the similar results...DFS, smooth and comfortable, but not terribly close. Can't complain as it's still close, and very comfortable. I'll take it!!!\n\nHappy Friday folks!",

When I told her is was coming back, she told me to pick up a set. She didn't have to tell me twice. I also got a set of Ghost Town Barber because I had to hit the Free Shipping threshold.

This usually means the end of the blade use, so tomorrow it will be a new one. After reading the scent notes on this soap, I had to order as soon as it was available. Leather, Tobacco & Oud, supported by a hint of Rose & Patchouli. I get mostly leather and tobacco, with maybe a hint of patchouli from the soap. The aftershave added some rose into the mix, but for some reason it made my face heat up a little bit. This doesn't happen with many aftershaves, so it may have been a fluke, we'll see with the next shave.\n\nAfter sharing this group with some fellow shavers on IRC earlier, I had to add it to the SOTD. Check out all of their catalog, extreme talent right here.",

The new Summer Break base is fantastic, it loaded easily and produced a great lather. Since I had a screaming toddler downstairs I was rushing a bit and didn't give it enough water but it still provided plenty of slickness and protection.\n\nI still haven't found anything that pairs well with the Icenii splash, it's a mix of floral and aquatic that I can't quite describe. It doesn't really seem to go with anything. It's nice enough, but not a favourite yet.",

I have a heavy beard and I didn't shave yesterday, but the 102 got me most of the way to DFS in just one pass. Good times.\n\nI have a bunch of Wickham samples to work through. I love their base and being a (bad) vegetarian the fact that it is vegan is a plus. Classic 24 is their take on Aventus, which I have never actually smelled. I like the scent of 24 a lot, it's definitely near the top of my list of candidates for full sets.\n\nI don't have the matching AS, but to my (weird) nose Imperial Rum complimented it quite well!\n\nHave an awesome weekend all!",

Bigelow (Proraso Green)\n* Post-shave: Captain's Choice Cat O' Nine Tails\n\nFirst time in a long while I've used a cream. Used a little too much water and it went on kinda soupy on the first pass. Second pass was a lot better, much slicker and more protective.\n\nShave was ok. I've been shaving daily for like a month and a half now (as opposed to every three days, or whenever I got tired of a full beard), and I think I'm starting to get some kind of stubble dysphoria. Like somehow everyone at work is going to think I did a shit job shaving if my neck and face aren't perfectly smooth. Did without the alum block today, as I'm really not seeing any improvement in skin feel from it.\n\nSecond time I've used the Cat O' Nine Tails. As much as they advertise this as a masochist kind of thing, burn-wise it really doesn't have shit on Clubman VIBR. Must be something to do with the cloves. Either way, it's a very pleasant smell, without the spiciness I typically associate with bay rum. Very moisturizing and protective on my skin as well.",

I'd be lying if I said that the strength of the scent didn't initially turn me off, but it builds a beautiful lather and grew on me by the time I finished my first pass. I always thought that I liked leather as a scent, but nothing I ever found really felt like it hit the mark. Leviathan does, and I think it'll take a little more getting used to as a soap before I love this.",

I come from loading for 20 seconds, so 9x the loading seemed a bit much, but I compromised. With a wetter brush I aggressively loaded for a solid minute. A few hairs lost and a hand cramp later, I had a wonderful lather that really had no need to develop on my face any further. It was pretty much ready to go. I used a smaller brush too, and the lather was becoming hard to contain in the bowl, I feel if I loaded for 2 more minute it would have been everywhere. The hole in the soap is considerably larger and I can't say I'd do it often, but once in a while isn't a big deal. Especially if we're in the soap killing business.\n\nLife is short, shave with good gear.\n",

Starting with a great brush and soap is the foundation of a good shave, and it's hard to do better than a big old Italian boar and a hard Italian soap. A soft Italian soap would have been just as good ;-) To anyone that says you should not use boars with hard soaps because badgers are a better tool for the job, I call bullshit.\n\nThe centerpiece of today's shave was the big old Italian straight razor, the Garibaldi 201. Very loud, with a distinct metallic twang. If it weren't for the daily upkeep and periodic honing, I'd use my straights more often, but frankly, shavettes shave better. Vintage fixed blade straights have character while shavettes have no soul; they're just tools that do their job very well.\n\nFinished off my shave with some menthol spiked Floid Blue and it's time for my morning beverage. Maybe tea, probably coffee brewed in a French Press.",

      "body": "[SOTD 6th of April, 2019 \"Two Kings\"](https://i.imgur.com/IlBTJdi.jpg)\n\n- Razor: Karve.\n- Blade: Astra\n- Soap: Noble Otter \"Two Kings\"\n- Brush: That Darn Rob Pueblo w/26mm Maggard SHD\n- Aftershave: Noble Otter Two Kings AS\n\n\nIt's so good being home. Got in last night around 6 o'clock, caught a Lyft home and was having dinner by seven. I had a pretty awesome mail call waiting for me of some soap and aftershave that I'm looking forward to photographing in the next couple of weeks.\n\nLA was a fantastic trip. They have some delicious food, had some great evening runs along the waterfront and I was even able to fit in a trip to Disneyland one night. I don't know about y'all but when I'm getting paid to visit somewhere I take the opportunity to spend a little bit more money so I can enjoy the trip a little more.\n\nI have a busy day ahead of me. I have to finish packing up some soaps and send them out as part of trades from this last week. C2, Lavanille, Fougere Bouquet and others will be going to new homes and I hope they are well enjoyed it.\n\nToday's shave was Two Kings. I bought this set following the restock at Maggard's. To be honest, while I love Nobel Otter, oud can be very hit or miss for me. /u/Ugmug send me a penny sample and I was blown away by how good it smelled. Two Kings is a very rose forward scent and the oud is more of a way to balance out the floralness. The scent is clean, fragrant and uplifting. It's a work appropriate scent, wearable year-round and I would argue could be unisex as well.\n\nLather was fantastic as you would expect from a Noble Otter V2 soap base. The lather was thick, slick and could handle a lot of water. I never found it to be finicky or difficult to whip up. I did a face lather with my Maggard's SHD and after a week of not using it, I was reminded of how lovely of a not the SHD is.\n\nPost shave I finished up with the matching aftershave. The entire shave from start to finish was just a pleasant experience. I need Cody to start releasing more soaps because aside from the one offs I am almost own all of his soaps at this point (gotta support a fellow Houstonian). I don't know if you've been following his Instagram, but I would recommend you do so if you haven't. He posted a mysterious picture a while back of an Otter in a pirate hat that has me intrigued.\n\nIn other news, I have a buddy of mine coming over today and we are going to be refinishing my dining room table. My wife likes to go to auctions, estate sales, antique shows and consignment shops scouring for furniture with good bones that she can bring new life into and resale. As such, the majority of my furniture are pieces that she has worked on and love so much she ended up keeping. My dining room table is made from solid oak and despite of being pretty hard over the last couple of years my children have tore it up pretty good. My wife's out of town for the next week in Texas with the kids so I thought it would be a nice surprise for her.\n\nI hope everybody's having a great Saturday. If you're hunting for one of the upcoming drops today good luck!\n\nRobot",

Not sure if it was the new plate or the blade, but the shave was extra scratchy and not smooth at all. I had good lather and was very mindful of the pressure. I'll try a different blade tomorrow and see what happens. Happy Saturday!",

Well, I'm pretty sure this isn't the one that comes in the jar (which is what I specifically asked for), but that's OK. It's free lol.\nI emptied the entire packet into my damp brush and proceeded to face lather, adding water a few drops at a time. If I used a smaller brush I probably could have gotten two uses out of the sample, but who likes an underloaded brush?!?!\nThe cream made a glorious lather, rich and thick, plenty slick, and the scent is spot on AdP Colonia, and a good strength!!!\nThe shave was OK. I haven't used Kai blades in a long time, and I broke this blade out to use because I was too lazy to take the wax off a Wizamet, so I got what I deserved lol. I know I ruined the blade transferring it from the UAG to this WR1, so I have no one but myself to blame for the mediocre shave. Oh well!!! There's always tomorrow for a better shave!!!\n\nHope everyone's weekend is going swell!!!",

I've tried Sudsy Soapery's Vetiver and Vanilla as well as WK's Dark Vetiver. While Scott may not like to rely on scent notes I can see what he was trying to get at with his narrative about this scent. Having traded my After the Rain set for this set my inner green man is smiling. For me working with my rosemary or lavender bush in the garden has the same herbal edge that this scent has while at the same time not resembling either of those notes. I don't get musty earth or mushroom, just a face full of Vetiver that has me wondering if I've shoved my face in some tropical drink. For me I don't see this as a fall specific scent. The moment you lather Darkfall you understand why it's a fall seasonal- this scent doesn't feel as season specific to me. The Icarus base continued to perform for me and I don't think I could complain about it if I wanted to. After being at the crag this morning the menthol of the splash was nice on my face but I continue to be curious about the mythical liniment.",

This soap is on the harder side but still loads easily into the brush. Ouzoud is made up of rose geranium, bergamot, patchouli, vetiver, ambergris, elemi, black pepper, and French lavender. Scent strength is light to medium when lathered. I get mostly rose geranium, vetiver and lavender from the lather. The soap is very slick and protective. I haven't used a Voskhod since I started DE shaving and the first use on this blade was not very comfortable. Hopefully it will improve with consecutive shaves.\n\nEnjoy some Power Metal!",

Finally. Trying a new (to me) scent of Lisa's.\n\n#### ❧ Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Fatip - Piccolo Black & Gold Open Comb ::: Gillette - Platinum ‹9 uses›)*\n\nfirst pass was snaggy and tuggy because of the unusually long whiskers. But other passes were superb. Face came away irritation free and comfy.\n\n#### ❧ Soap Notes\n*^(Lisa's Natural Herbal Creations - Doc Holiday)*\n\n30 + 10 + 10 second load with lightly-wet, low-backbone boar brush + 2.5 tsp water = 4 passes of creamy slick lather. Don't know if it's this brush or the soap, but definitely need a longer load time than the 30 seconds I started out with on this one. This brush feels like it holds more water than my usual boars. Maybe the longer bristles, and more of them is the cause. Maybe that means sling more water out, than usual, before the load, or just load for longer.\n\nScent: mainly cedar from the tub. Very light when lathered.\n\nScent Strength: 4/10, very lightly present during shaving. But I need to try again on this one to be sure.\n\nBowl - I used the XL version of this bowl:\nhttps://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3392930\n\n#### ❧ Brush Notes\n*^(Semogue - 2000 Boar‹6 uses›)*\n\nbig comfy is his name. Broken in and wonderful in just a few shaves. .. though the tips will continue to split.\n\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Cut flush to where I just see the tips (above average for me)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm)\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

I'm a big fan of shaving with both of them and I can't decide which I like better. However... I'm beginning to realize that I'm not a huge fan of their lingering scent as the hours pass post-shave. Neither matches or seems to blend with / compliment any of my colognes. Combine that with how long it takes me to lather up and I can't decide if I actually want to invest in a full tub or not because I can't see myself using them any time other than the weekends.

I also really enjoy Declaration Grooming soaps as a whole. So it should be no surprise when I tell you that this was a great shave. In the last month I've been lucky enough to shave with several different lavender soaps including B&M Reserve Lavender, NO Monarch and B&M Tuesday. I also have samples of SW Lavender, MLS Jefferson Square and L&L Champs de Lavande in the hopper. I'm being honest when I say I really enjoy Lavender.\n\nI've read that pure lavender was created via combining four different lavender strains to balance out the floral, peppery, and herbaceous nature of Lavender into a unified whole. Well I'm no expert in fragrances I do feel that having smelled real lavender and used a lot of lavender soap's I have a good idea of what I like and what smells \"natural\".\n\nPure Lavender smells like Lavender. There's no additives, powderiness or cream. There are no additional notes of pepper, violets or other florals. This soap smells like Lavender in its purest form. Set strength off the puck was medium and remained so throughout the majority of the shave. The aftershave toner continue that same medium-mild scent for around three hours slowly fading over time.\n\nThe soap base was produced by Declaration Grooming and uses their Bison Tallow base. It's simply fantastic. Full disclosure I do prefer the Icarus base, however Bison Tallow is one of the first soap based I shaved with and I'm very familiar with it. The lather was thick and moderately shiny. My razor had no issues with glide. Between the hydrating soap and the post shave toner my skin felt incredibly smooth and moisturized.\n\nIn other news I'm back home and my family still in Texas. I just got done sleeping for 14 hours. I typically burn the candle on both ends between my work, family, photography and running and apparently my body said enough was enough. I laid down last night around 4 PM to watch a little TV and I woke up at 6 AM. Also, lather games are coming up soon. I'm looking forward to that. I don't know how people in the past done it but I'm planning on blocking out each day ahead of time for what I'm going to shave with. Hopefully this will allow me to produce 30 days of nonstop photos. Finally, circling back to Lavender. Someone I know and trust recommended some Dapper dragon Lavender Lizard. If anyone here is looking to sell or trade some. Please let me know.\n\nEnjoy your Sunday!\nRobot",

Why buy 1 sample when you can blindly buy 8, right? I'm a big Chiseled Face fan so it seemed like a no brainer.\n\nLong story short this stuff delivers. If you told me it was a $15 soap i'd say ok, sure. But for $10? After one use i can say this just might be one of the best values around. The scent is light on the soap, which I have no problem with, clearly if you are making a $10 soap you need to cut some corners, and i'd rather that corner be cut than quality of ingredients. Lathered very easily in my water (which i've read is hard), and was pretty darn slick. Is it Icarus or Reserve? No, but it's less than half the price. Scent on Burnish is nice, a safe citrus.\n\nThe aftershave is OK. I'm a huge fan of Chiseled Face aftershave, and this feels a little bit of a step down, just because the alcohol is a little more present. Again, at $10, a great value, but i'd probably personally pass on a bottle of the aftershave, at least this one.",

A match made in heaven.\n\nThe Durham Duplex is the original replaceable blade razor. It was patented in 1907, two years before the Weck Sextoblade. This razor is unique in that it is a double-edged straight with a toothy guard. The modern Italian Daune razor is similar, but has a conventional DE guard.\n\nI used my English Duplex today; it's a later model than my American model, and has moulded one-piece scales rather than the earlier models' conventional three piece scales. It also doesn't have Durham Duplex stamped on the guard. From what I can tell, it's a bit lighter, but shaves the same as its older American cousin. Here's a [family portrait](https://i.imgur.com/08DDnx6.jpg) - US on top with a blade loaded, and English on the bottom.\n\nIt's a great little shaver for someone who wants to try a razor that your grip like a straight rather than a conventional safety razor. It's stupid simple to learn (compared to a shavette or conventional straight), and can easily be bought for under $20",

We returned from the hospital around 3 PM on Friday with our little bundle of joy. Mom and baby are both very healthy, and we've been sneaking in some sleep when we get the chance. IIRC this shave was around 5:30 AM; I just hadn't gotten around to posting it yet :).\n\n/u/phteven_j and /u/johnb413 really killed it on this brush handle. I'm super happy with how the handle turned out, and the colors match really well with our \"woodland creatures\" nursery theme.\n\n/u/declarationgrooming worked his magic and installed a new 28mm B7 knot to finish out the brush. B7 is a really nice fit for my preferences regarding badger hair. First impressions - it's fairly soft on the face (kinda similar face feel to B4), and has a good bit more backbone without being overwhelming. I'll see how it changes as the knot opens up, but I'm pretty sure it's only going to get better as it breaks in. I'm very happy that I have also recently acquired the matching aftershave to go with Contemplation to complete my enjoyment of the scent.\n\nI've added back the face lotion to my aftershave routine to give me some more moisturizing action and to include something with sunblock in it since we live in Florida.\n\n[Obligatory cute baby pic](https://i.imgur.com/fKKDF5u.jpg)",

This was the first time in the history of ever that I've tried to shave with a straight razor. Results were not impressive. With three passes and a great deal of patience, I was able to get something approximating a really bad safety razor shave. Lots of learning how to hold the thing, stretch out skin, shave with my weak hand (if I was any less ambidextrous, I'd be the lead villain on *The Fugitive*), and figuring out shave angles. Results were ok on my cheeks, passable on my neck, and awful on my chin and upper lip (must be why Lynn Abrams has a mustache).\n\nThe soap was new as well. I've kind of got a fixation on stuff sold to professional barbers, so when I heard about the Rasozero line, against all better judgment, I had a kilo shipped over from Spain. The soap is an outstanding performer, as far as latherability and cushion. The Spiffero (green label) is very close scent-wise to Proraso Green, without the menthol.\n\nFinished up with the tried-and-true Epsilon today. I'm a little discouraged in regards to my first straight razor shave, but I felt the same way when I picked up my Merkur 34 back in 2014. We'll see what tomorrow brings.",

My first time using SV. I've gotta say, I was pretty impressed. I found the performance solid, and I like the scent. I haven't used much in the way of higher end traditional soapmakers as I have mostly stuck to artisans (except Proraso, Arko, and Williams).\n\nMy last shave with this blade that I've been using all week. This was the sixth shave it was definitely not cutting quite as well. Still a pretty decent shave though.\n\nBonus pic ft. gelled tips: https://imgur.com/gallery/fj2I8wh",

The hair maintains just enough heat to be comfortable while face lathering and the tips are nice and soft. I love the scent on Bad Habits, but it is an older base of The Club, so it doesn't perform as well as Signature. I know people rag on Proraso sometimes, but I really do enjoy this aftershave. I will be buying once I run out, and since this one is actually down under 1/3 full, I may live to see that day!\n\nI'm stealing the song from u/ntownuser, not sure whey he shared it, but I'm glad he did.

That was a nice way to start the day off.\n\nThis brush has really grown on me. After I started using it every shave for a while, I really started to enjoy the knot. It's not \"gel tipped\" (though there are some hooks), but it's one of the softest knots I've had after B2.\n\nI managed to somehow give myself a very shallow cut while adjusting my sideburns, and the little bugger kept on bleeding. I haven't had to use styptic for a cut in a long time.\n",

I've been doing a lot of experimenting lately with synthetic brushes...which, today, included bowl lathering with a new bowl from Doug Smith Pottery.\n\n\nGotta say, love the bowl. I've been using it for almost a week, and I'm really surprised by it's performance. When I first started making my own lather, the general consensus was something like, \"Any bowl will do. Don't buy anything expensive.\" While I don't count Doug's bowl as expensive (ringing in at under $25), it is light years ahead of the ceramic soup bowl I started with, performance-wise. I've been getting superb lathers with it. Until today. User error. Added too much water. Cut me some slack, it was my first time bowl lathering DG Bison.\n\n\nSpeaking of DG Bison, this Cuir et Epices tub/AS was my first set as a wetshaver. I'm surprised it's still around. I love it more than ever, and it was my first love. Sound familiar?\n\n\n*The Song:* Best artist recommendation I ever got from Pandora. I was listening to Tom Waits Radio at the time.\n\n",

High near 38. East wind around 10 mph, with gusts as high as 20 mph. Chance of precipitation is 100%. Total daytime snow accumulation of less than one inch possible. High tide at 2:12 this afternoon.\n\n**Razor/Blade:** The other day I was going through the blade packs that I have and saw the Astra's. Thought to myself that I haven't used them since I first started so might was well give them another try. They perform very well in the Timeless, going to see how long it lasts and then might put one in the Wolfman.\n\n**Soap/Splash/Frag:** Got this set in the mail on Saturday. Got a sample of the Frag when Biblio was released and got around to trying it a couple of weeks ago. Loved it, and was sorely disappointed that I had missed out on the soap and splash. /u/reut0 was kind enough to trade his set. It's everything I hoped it would be.\n\nHave a nice Monday everyone!",

Kind of a mix of patchouli and incense. The scent strength is very strong as CBL is known for doing. Scent notes listed are amber, patchouli, rose, sandalwood, jasmine, citrus, vanilla, and powder.\n\nThis soap can take a lot of water and ends up really slick with minimal post shave dryness. The website says, \"To get the best results you will want to limit the amount of water introduced while loading. A damp brush swirled on the surface of the soap OR a dryer brush swirled on a lightly bloomed surface will provide the best results. The amount of volume and how slick the lather will be will depend on how and when you add water. Be sure to add plenty of water and you will be rewarded with a very slick lather.\"\n\nI also picked up their barbershop and will be trying it out soon.\n",

Talbot's base is fantastic and I've been trying to pick up a soap tub since then.\n\nI don't have a very good nose but I mostly got straight lavender with a very faint rosemary scent. My wife wasn't able to pick out the rosemary and only smelled lavender. It smelled great and performed extremely well. I had 6 prior shaves with the Perma-Sharp blade and it really felt like I was using a fresh blade.",

I really appreciate the generosity of the folks in this sub and I will pay it forward someday.\n\nFirst use of badger was okay. I was eager to give the brush a try, was in a hurry and didn't load enough soap. The brush felt good on the face but I did notice the 'pin-pricks' of the bristles at first. The backbone and face feel of the brush is quite nice for a 'massage' - the bristles retain warmth well. I plan to use the brush for a few shaves to dial in a better lather.\n\nShave #10 and the Voshkod is still going strong. I tend to 3-pass shave anyway. Now that the blade is dulled a little bit, it feels good. I don't get the impression it will last as long as the Astra did.\n\nI have a few new soaps in the den so along with the badger, I'm hella looking forward to the next shave!\n\nKeep those Monday blues at bay folks!",

A total of 14 samples arrived from Maggard last week, I'll be cruising non-stop through all of them over the next few months.\n\nI chose to start with Cologne Russe (a soap I'd been planning to buy before I decided to go down the sample route) and it performed beautifully. The smell was strong off the soap, but chilled out into a complex, interesting scent once lathered. I'm nose-dumb so that's the best I can describe it. Not sure I love the scent, but I'll know by the time the sample's gone! The lather was fantastic, no question about that. Brush and razor and blade were great as always.",

King got my WK Fougere Bouquet and I got his NO Trail. King was a great trader and very understanding that I was out of town all last week.\n\nA few days back I shaved with NO \"Two Kings\". I'm not trying to sound like a fanboy or a shill, but I really like Cody's soaps. Lather comes easily and there's yet to have been a scent I have not enjoyed (albeit some more than others, but no strikeouts).\n\nNoble Otter describes the trail as \"venture through the forest in the Pacific Northwest you get all the smells of a lush forest full of Pine, Fir, Sage, Lavender, Oakmoss, Juniper and a touch of Rain. \"The Trail\" is our tribute to the Pacific Northwest and in particular to Oregon.\"\n\nFun fact, I lived in Oregon for three years and I did a lot of hiking while I was there. To me, The Trail is a tribute and less of a recreation. I remember the coniferous evergreens, wet pine needles and lots of damp vegetation from the rain. I never recall much juniper, lavender or sage during my hikes. That's not to say that the scent is bad. It's not, it's quite nice, but shaving with it didn't recreate the same memories of hiking in Ft. Stevens state park just after a rain through moss covered giants.\n\nLather and slickness were excellent as one would expect from the NO v2 base. I had no problems building a nice, moisturizing, yougurty lather via presoaed SHD Maggard 26mm knot. I elected for a face lather today as I tend to do as of late. I like the exfoliation of the badger brush as it works up some volume.\n\nI didn't have the matching AS so I elected to go for my default of Clubman. After the fact I remembered I had some old Stirling coniferous on my shelf and I probably should have grabbed that in hindsight.\n\nAll in all a wonderful shave. I'm exited about the week ahead. I have some great shaves coming from some labels I've not tried before. I'm also kicking around the idea of trying some Sandalwood soaps. I managed to acquire a Santal Auster yesterday and I'm also looking for a Talbots Lliahi Ridge.\n\nHave a great Monday!\n\nRobot",

And I've heard a lot of good things about 88 Chestnut (previously 4th and Pine) as a wonderful citrus scent. But do I really *need* 88 Chestnut in my life? I had a great shave with Uplift. Tons and tons of lemon in there and a nice slick lather. I followed up with Hydra splash, which is just an absolute citrus bomb. Topped the whole lot off with Guerlain Homme L'Eau Boisée, which is a nice mojito-y scent on top of some very tame vetiver. However, I'm so used to EdTs and EdPs that I woefully underapplied the cologne and thus can't smell anything but the Hydra. Oh well.\n\nSo maybe the lesson is that I really do need a citrus-forward EdT... Ok, just looked and 88 Chestnut frag is EdC, not EdT. Something to think about, I guess.",

Great shaver, somewhat more aggressive than the Blacklands Sabre L2, yet also more efficient, and gives me a longer lasting BBS. The ATG shaving on the Bullet Tip is better than on the 1912 or Pushbutton, because the butterfly head pinioning of the blade is better than the clip springs used on those other models. (Though not quite as good as the modern Sabre's blade retention systems, a DE style three piece system).\n* Soap: Great scent, the strongest scented of the original trio of Reserve scents. Excellent performance, perhaps the best in the business, especially for those with softer water.",

Let me describe [the first shave](https://i.imgur.com/cRHpi3q.jpg) briefly.\n\nThis started with a discussion that was going on in our IRC - \"can soaps like Icarus get better\"? One thing led to another, and the topic of 'post shave' came. I remembered that this CeraVe facial cleanser doesn't leave my face dry (like most shave soaps) - so maybe there is scope for improvement. Then someone mentioned - CeraVe isn't technically soap. But I remembered my face feeling plenty slick with it. So I said, fuck it, I will try it.\n\nAt that time, I was also enjoying u/ItchyPooter's comment on hipster barbers doing [ASMR type videos](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/ba3uy8/saturday_daily_questions_newbie_friendly_apr_06/ek9e21u/). So I thought, why don't I take out my Feather AC SS folding razor and try it. Long story short - it wasn't bad but wasn't enjoyable - the 'lather' was too slick - couldn't stretch my skin at all, even with an alum. Had to finish my shave with a DE razor.\n\nThat leads to this shave - CeraVe + DE Razor. The shave was phenomenal - Cerave (a good amount applied) is very slick, absolutely no friction, no problem buffing. I did a full 3 pass shave, my face was BBS. I applied alum to see if I fucked up - close to 0 burn. Now here are some things I didn't enjoy - the lack of lathering process (this is my favorite thing about wetshaving), I can't see the lather - so I am not sure if I am going over the same area over and over again, no fancy smell. 'Lather' was a bit difficult to wash off.\n\nAll in all, this was a fun experiment ... that I will probably never repeat. IMO, it is 100% possible to get an excellent shave with a DE razor with CeraVe, maybe not with a straight as stretching is close to impossible. Off I go to do other meaningless tasks (like Job).",

I bought a 100ml tube of this Nivea shave cream while on vacation in Zurich last year, for about $4, and the Stubble Buster I picked up for $7 during last year's Black Friday sale. Honestly, this was a fantastic shave. The 5th use of this blade really mellowed it out--I felt very little of the blade even though the audible feedback was louder than normal. The Nivea cream was plenty slick and had a nice residual skin conditioning after I rinsed off. And the Stubble Buster is an exceptional value as well--nice cooling menthol, and left my skin feeling soft and moisturized. You really can save a whole lot of money DE shaving if you just let go of the FOMO on all these unobtanium artisan products.",

Not sugary sweet, but kind of a ripe fruit sweet. Nothing that makes me want to eat the soap, but still. The splash is a little stronger in the menthol than my other splashes which makes this a great wake up shave.\n\nMy 5 year old wanted to smell the splash last night. I told him it smells the same as the soap, but he insisted. After being told multiple times not to press his nose onto what he in smelling, he planted his nose right on the plug and got the bottom of his nose and the top part of his upper lip covered in it. He goes: \"ewwww. My nose is all wet... it burns!\" So we had a talk about menthol. I explained that it won't hurt him, but it'll make his skin cold and it'll be gone by bedtime. Gotta love kids who have to learn the hard way. Thank God it wasn't Cryogen.\n\nHappy Tuesday!",

And I don't usually use this brush with a cream. It's amazing at how little of this cream is needed for a shave. It is kinda deceiving at first. I sheared a small amount on my face and started working it. I thought I was going to have to add more cream, but I just kept working it. Soon I had more lather than I knew what to do with. I kept adding water and I ended up with lather running down the brush handle onto my hand. The scent is somewhat medicinal to my nose, but not unpleasant. Performance is pretty good too. Not bad for a commercial product.\n\nWork awaits.",

The scent is heavy on mango and almost smells like juicy fruit gum. Very nice citrusy scent. But, the real star is the new base. It's super easy to use and the performance is fantastic. It's a huge step up from the old base and the slickness was excellent. Excellent job /u/rocketk455!\n\nAlso thanks to /u/reguyw_nothingtolose for the chance to try this SHD knot. Seriously impressive. It's so soft and felt extremely luxurious. It generated lather almost like a synthetic knot. I was really blown away how good it is. No, it's not Declaration but it has to be the best value out there for those looking for a cheaper option.",

Chiseled Face lathers so easily and is such a great soap base.\n\nI'm gonna nerd out a second about guitar stuff. If anyone plays electric guitar and knows what a Kemper Profiler is, great. If not, it's basically a fancy computer that you setup with an Amp, pedals and speaker of your choice and it uses an algorithm to be able to replicate the sound of all the parts. I just picked up a pack of \"Profiles\" based on the important Ozzy guitarists and it's just so much fun! The Bark at the Moon profile uses the same style of modified Marshall Super Lead Plexi, same distortion pedals and same speakers that Jake E. Lee recorded the album with. Spot on! Nerd rant over.",

I've only used the Glissant base in a sample container before. I found the base to be slick, easy to lather and not drying for my face. Residual slickness was a little lacking but it made so much lather it was no problem at all to slap a little onto areas I needed to touch up. This was a well blended scent and very enjoyable for me. I will definitely be trying to pick up a bottle of the splash at u/bostonphototourist 's drop. After trying samples of Leviathan, Hallows, Lavanille and LGC I kinda \"moved on.\" Seville in Reserve and Reserve Fern had me reconsidering the artisan and frankly I'm feeling foolish after my shave this morning. The Bay Rum is just tremendous. I've been curious about Cologne Russe and I see at least a sample of that in the near future. If Excelsior is *better* than Glissant there will definitely be a spot for Will's offerings in my den. Happy shaves everybody!",

Holy shit y'all, I see what the hype is about! I went with Cookie first and damn does it smell just like a cookie, in every possible good way imaginable. Not only is it true enough to life to get my belly to rumble a bit, but it seriously is a very well performing soap in and of itself! Lathers very easily to the point that I got the water ratio right after the second try. I ended up with that wonderful yogurt-like lather that went on super smooth. Great slickness, protection, and amazing post shave feel. No tightness or burning or anything.\n\nI had no matching aftershave, so I went with Barrbarr which is the closest thing I've got and I really enjoyed the spiciness of the aftershave and the way it played off of the cookie scent. And, of course, had to go with TF Tobacco Vanille on top which perfectly ties everything together.",

I typically find this razor head's geometry unpleasant and a bit harsh, but I like to give every blade a chance to prove itself in all my razors so I can determine where it does its best work (unless it's so awful that it can't make it past one or two shaves, in which case that blade is just DEAD to me). The Lord + EJ pairing was surprisingly nice. Smooth, easy, good feedback - maybe a little more buffing necessary than I like to get BBS, but it was so gentle that I didn't mind. Pretty much flawless results post-shave. (Gonna set this blade aside for later and use something different next time though - I have plans for it.)\n\nStirling Green was a Black Friday special release that I picked up rather late. Notes are listed as basil, bergamot, and lavender up top; pine in the heart; and cedar, musk, oakmoss, and patchouli in the base. That's significantly less than the 23 notes that make up the real cologne, so it's no surprise that it isn't an exact match. That's fine with me... I like Polo Green, but it's pretty intense stuff and I'd never be able to handle it on my face. The soap doesn't need to duplicate the real thing, anyway: it only needs to *compliment it* and enhance the best parts of the cologne, and Stirling Green does a good job of that.\n\nA bit harsh on the puck, once it is lathered it mellows a little and has a smokey/woody/herbal opening. The pine and cedar manifest themselves more as a \"chopping firewood\" smell than a \"needles and sap up your nose\" smell, which is nice. It's not a match for modern Polo's tobacco-heavy opening, but I like this better. Post shave it settles down into that smooth, lush, greenish musk-oakmoss-patchouli drydown that I enjoy so much in Polo and Azzaro pour Homme (and which is there to a lesser extent in Drakkar Noir and Paco Rabanne). This soap would pair excellently with all four of those colognes.\n\nPerformance? I decided to see what would happen if I spent as much time and effort building the Stirling lather as I've been putting into B&M soaps lately, even though I can reach a perfectly serviceable Stirling lather with far less work. Frig, guys... it was so damn good with all the extra elbow grease. Every bit the equal to Reserve or Glissant in every way. I'll give Waves a shot again Thursday to see how it compares, but I'm really not convinced that Reserve is a step up *for me.* It's Definitely not a black and white difference... maybe shades of grey at the most.",

Even though it was more pricey than store bought soap, it left my skin feeling refreshed and moisturized. There also wasn't any of the stripped feeling you get from certain soap brands. I definitely would recommend giving it a try.\n\nFor the shave, I was excited to use the new soap base. On my post from yesterday I described the scent of Field day as dewy fresh cut grass. After creating the lather, the scent really opened up and smelt like a nice spring morning. The soap was slick and performed really well. The only issue I had was with how much water to add. If you add too much water too quickly, the soap becomes foamy and it takes a little work to get back into shape. But after working with it, it will produce a nice comfortable lather.\n\nThe post shave feel was a nice improvement from the previous base. I normally add lotion immediately after a shave, but this time I held off. My skin felt great for about an hour after the shave, but began to feel a little tight after that.\n\nAs for me: We are expecting at least a foot of snow this week in southern MN. Even though it has been mid 50-60s, mother nature has to give us just a little bit more of winter!",

I still plan to dial this one in a little more. The scent on this one is really good. Also noticed that B&M used to make 5.5oz containers!\n\nSecond use with the badger was much better. I started with loading more soap than I usually do, used my bowl for a little bit to get a soapy lather and then went to town with face lathering. Whenever I thought I was done, I pushed myself to add a little more water and keep working the lather.\n\nI found the brush didn't release lather as easily. The painting of lather takes a light touch compared to synthetic.\n\nShave #11 with the Voshkod is the last. The blade din't feel as good on the last pass. Next up is a Big Ben blade.\n\nLastly, the Stirling AS balm worked much better on a damp face. Still took a little time to work into my skin and felt a little sticky afterward but after the dry down, man was my skin smooth and happy! Thanks to /u/shaveSymptomatic for the tip on applying this balm to a damp face. I used about a cm of paste but will likely use even less next time.\n\nHave a good Tuesday folks!",

First time I've tried CB with an SE, and will probably be the last. The cream soap base is borderline decent with DE, but the protection deficiency I experience there becomes a dealbreaker for SE shaves, at least with a GEM. My face felt really raw and scraped during and after the shave, and the increasing discomfort led me to speed through the last few minutes, so I ended up with something between BBS and DFS. And lots of residual redness and discomfort!\n* The Florentine Fern scent is amazing and wonderful, complex and interesting fougere. I wish CB would change their base a bit, as they are getting to be rather like LASSCO used to be for me: a pleasure to smell, but a below par shave in terms of comfort. (The new CF LASSCO is somewhat better in that regard.) Apparently many love the CB base as it is, but I grow increasingly reluctant to use either the soap or cream soap bases.\n* I am not a tallow uber alles guy; I get great vegan shaves from Wholly Kaw, Dr Jon, Eufros, and even the CK base. But the minimalist composition of CB does not work well for me.\n* **Post**: As I reeled out of the bathroom, grasping for shave balm, my wife watched me with unbelieving eyes, and as I smeared the mentholated Cremo on my scraped red face, tears welled up in my eyes from the icy sting. Missus Malthus looked at me and said \"how's the hobby going\"?\n* About a minute later, I could gasp \"it's OK\", thanks mainly to Cremo. The combo of cold and moisturizing works for an effective one-two punch to turn even agonized skin into a relatively painless face in a very short while. My face was not entirely copacetic thereafter and still stings a bit even now, hours later, but I know from experience that Cremo / Duke Cannon (very similar formulas) are the most reliable \"firemen\" I have in the arsenal.",

While I could not detect any difference in the closeness of the shave, the side with the aggressive setting during the final pass felt a bit rougher and I also had a couple of weepers there...test done and back to normal from next shave on.\n\n\n\nI cannot believe, it has taken me so long to use this APR scent for the first time - absolutely beautiful and I totally agree whit all the rave Fenchurch reviews and the resulting [APR lather was just wonderful](https://i.imgur.com/X2xvPEM.jpg).\n\n\n\n**I hope you all have a terrific Tuesday**",

That said, I was thinking Biblio might be a good pairing. Throw together a trip to the GTB with some musty old books and call it the Doc Holliday.\n\nSo, who got lucky in the Declaration/Wolf Whiskers drop yesterday? I took a look at the brushes, but since I was simultaneously unboxing my B7 \"ABH\" Jeffo, I wasn't really motivated to procure another of the same batch. I did, however, use my Declaration points balance to get a tub of 88 Chestnut on the cheap since so many people spoke so highly of 4th and Pine. I wonder if I have enough Chatillon Lux points to get the matching splash on the cheap as well...",

Also trying a redo with the loading time with this brush for Lisa's soaps. Nailed it.\n\n#### ❧ Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Gillette - Sheraton 1938 ::: Gillette - Nacet ‹131 uses›)*\n\nIf you're new to my run with the Nacet, here's a bit of info: the Sheraton seems to be the best razor in my collection to handle this old, smooth blade. I guess the geometry is just right for me.\n\nThere was some stinging tugging on the first pass, but that was largely due to the fact that today was to shave off 2 days of growth, something the Nacet and Sheraton don't really like. Pass 2 and 3 were wonderfully efficient and comfy. By the time the shave was done, the irritation/rawness of the first pass was gone.\n\n#### ❧ Soap Notes\n*^(Lisa's Natural Herbal Creations - Doc Holiday)*\n\nThis is a type of lather that doesn't puff up, remaining fairly glue-ish looking, like a souffle that's collapsed. Now, I'd rather shorten all that into a term like \"low-structure\" and move on. But apparently that drives some people crazy. So if that's you, please don't read the last three sentences in this paragraph, or you may get upset.\n\n60 second load with very lightly-wet, low-backbone boar brush + 2.5 tsp water = 4 passes of top-tier, luxurious, creamy, slick lather.\n\nScent: mainly straight cedar from the tub and in the lather. I'm sure the other ingredients even it out a little to keep it from being one dimensional, but it's a bit hard to detect, for me, at least. I'm not a cedar fan, so I'll look to pass this soap on... maybe in trade for another Lisa's scent.\n\nScent Strength: 4-5/10, lightly present during shaving. Acceptable for me.\n\nBowl - I used the XL version of this bowl:\nhttps://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3392930\n\n#### ❧ Brush Notes\n*^(Semogue - 2000 Boar‹8 uses›)*\n\ngreat brush. I added a second o-ring, because it was splaying a bit too much. I think that will pan out nicely as it continues to develop. A soft, comfortable brush for sure.\n\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: A little irritating\n*Neck*: A little irritating\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Cut flush to where I just see the tips (above average for me)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm)\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

I had a couple days of growth so the Karve D plate came out. Absolutely amazing results with this thing.\n\nI thought the cart would be better for speed but the maneuverability issues I had caused a couple cuts ATG! Very unexpected.\n\nThis shave solidified the superiority of DEs for me. In the unfortunate event of travel with only carry on I might pick up a Mach 3 to better suit my needs.\n\nSoap smells awesome like ADP. Thinking of picking up a bottle of the actual stuff or Essenza. Any thoughts appreciated!",

I was going to eventually get around to ordering a sample, until I saw /u/dendj55 (thanks again) threw up a PIF...Figured sure, worst case, I re-PIF it. Sorry, but that won't be the case. To my nose, it's definitely floral, but it's the lightest scented SW soap that i've smelled, so the florals aren't at all overpowering which is what I was afraid of, it'll be a nice change of pace every now and then.\n\nEdit: Using the TTS tool to post is a game changer.

Only did two passes since my face has been a little raw, and I was in a rush. I smell fantastic. I like the way TNeV and Biblio work off each other. The tea scent goes well with dry, woody fragrance. Plus, the fruity hint (strawberry) in TNeV balances out that initial dryness in Biblio, which is awesome but can be a little much.\n\nI also skipped the Thayers today and regretted it. I've been wondering if it even actually does anything to put it on before my aftershave, but I was definitely a little tight without it. I've almost exclusively used NO for the last 6-7 shaves and haven't noticed any tightness with the witch hazel. I'll need to do some more experimenting.\n\nMan, I am excited for the new AS formula and fragrances from NO. Plus, that Bay Rum scent that was just announced sounds awesome.",

I wasn't in any hurry given the impressions of it that I'd read. A shame since I like the 2000s quite a bit.\n\nAnyway it's not terrible I guess. It didn't shred my face and it did give an ok, sub DFS shave with only moderately more irritation than usual. On the other hand there's a huge amount of blade chatter, far too much weight in the head compared to the handle and it doesn't seem to do anything on settings of less than about 5. Not a keeper.\n\nWickham's lather was stellar as usual. I don't know what dark pact they have made to get such a good vegan lather, but it was worth it! Irish fern is their Fougère scent. A bit too subtle for my tastes. Falls into the pleasant, not offensive bucket for me.",

Getting really close to killing *Cuir et Epices*, but might not pull it off before B&M's *Diamond* release, to which I'm literally counting down the hours.\n\n\nSide note:. I'm really liking Gillette Nacets. I've been wetshaving for about 1.5 years. I don't try blades often anymore, but in my recent attempts, I haven't found any that I don't like. I'm wondering if, when your technique is solid, they're pretty much all alike. My other faves are Voskhod and Personna LBs.\n\n\nPS - Looking to sell an unused Seville in Reserve set to make space. I'll be posting to the Bazaar in a few days if no one hits me up.",

I got a creamy, slick, thick Lather right out of the gate. The smell is fruity and sweet, more fruit than sweet. It reminds me of the smell of mango based fruit jerky. I haven't dialed in the Lather yet but when I do I bet it'll be just wonderful. I can't judge on post shave but I found the cushioning and slickness to be quite good, albeit I over watered at first and had poor cushioning (and had to re Lather). I found stearic acid spots building in the soap already, so it'll have to die sooner rather than later, but I'm looking forward to every shave.",

It's as good as I remember. There is something about this scent that I love can't quite pin it down.\n\nThe base is excellent. I don't know the last time they did a reformulation, but if it's been this good since I started they had a top performing base for a while. Unlike some of the current artisans who, I believe, could do with some tweaks Chiseled Face's base can stand up right along side Barrister and Mann, Noble Otter, and Declaration Bison/Icarus.\n\nHave a nice Wednesday everyone!",

At first sniff, it smells basically like an aquatic. Nothing too special, but nothing to dislike either. This is a soap that truly opens up when it's lathered and is one that I can't point my finger at any single scent note. I mean, it's still obviously an aquatic, but there's some stuff goin on in the background that make this scent really stand out. I have no aquatic scents in my den, so I had to bust out the Colbeck from the cabinet where it's been collecting dust while it's so damn cold outside and it seemed to compliment the scent well. And of course to top it off, I went with one of the more popular aquatics ADG and it actually kinda fell flat to an extent for me after getting a good few minutes worth of Marine. So yeah, gonna need an aftershave or EdT or some such soon.",

I usually use the WR2 which does quite well also, but just takes a bit more attention and will sometimes punish you for laziness. Shaken is a great scent, and the AS formula really is nice and soothing. Tonight is Game 1 of CBJ - Tampa and I think it will officially mark the countdown to shaving the beard.\n\nHappy hump day y'all.",

      "body": "[SOTD: 10th of April, 2019 \"Trade Winds\"](https://i.imgur.com/4ShOgtE.jpg)\n\n- Razor: Rockwell 6s 3 plate\n- Blade: Astra\n- Soap: Chiseled Face \"Trade Winds\"\n- Brush: That Darn Rob Pueblo w/26mm Maggard SHD\n- Aftershave: Pinault \"Clubman\" AS\n\nMorning /r/Wetshaving\n\nI once spent three years living aboard a ship and sailing all up and down the west coast from the straights of Juan de Fuca south to the Gulf of Panama and everything in between. My father was a sailor and he used to go out of town for two months at a time only to come home and bring me and my sister trinkets and toys from his port calls. I've lived near the sea most of my life and spent more time on it then most.\n\nAquatic scents evoke memories in me. They are something that, like Clubman is near to my heart (I've mentioned before why Clubman will never leave my collection). I've yet to really talk about aquatic scents or my history as a sailor much (though I have mentioned in in passing to some folks on IRC). So today I shaved with Trade Winds by Chiseled Face.\n\nScent notes from Try that Soap are Aqua, Ozone, Cucumber and Peppermint and the description from Groomitorium states *\"Our fresh aquatic scent - ocean, ozone, cucumber and a touch of mint backed up by a base of old spice. The closest you can get to sailing a tall ship without leaving your bathroom!\"*\n\nI've used Trade Winds multiple times before posting this SOTD and if I am being honest, it doesn't resonate in me. It's not a bad scent and my wife likes it. It smells very clean. My issue with it is the same issue that I have with many aquatic soap scents. It doesn't remind me of salty sea air first thing in the morning. I want a ocean scent that is cold, damp, salty and with a touch of seaweed. Something visceral that brings back the feeling of ocean spray on my face. I haven't found that yet.\n\nThe lather performed just as good as you would expect from Chiseled Face. If you have shaved with the Zoologist line or any of the others like Ghost Town Barber or Midnight Stag you will know what I am referring to. The base is what I would call forgiving. I learned to shave with Ghost Town Barber and despite my lack of experience I never had a problem making a solid lather.\n\nI finished off the shave with Clubman. Not the best aftershave in the world, but the scent has that barbershop memory that I keep coming back to. The alcohol does tend to dry me out and I would kill for a Chatty Lux Toner with the Clubman scent. I know that sounds crazy, but I would love to pair the classic scent with modern performance and moisturizing.\n\nI shaved with my Rockwell 6s. I have been using my Karve alot lately and I diden't want to neglect my other razors. My brush remains the That Darn Rob with the SHD Maggards Knot. If you are on the fence about a SHD knot I would recommend you get one. It has been doing a ton of work lately and gels like a boss.\n\nIn other news, I have been working on some side projects lately. Can't really speak about what they are but I've enjoyed being creative in something outside of photography. Circling back to Aquatic scents. If you have any suggestions for something like what I am describing I would love to hear it.\n\nThanks and have a great Wednesday!\n\nRobot",

I couldn't even finish the shave with it, so I grabbed a backup razor (Super Speed & Astra Platinum) to finish the job. End result: an entire neck of razor rash, awful irritation, razor burn, etc. I'm disappointed because the packaging is so cute... but this is the worst blade I've tried so far.\n\nI'm a bit embarrassed to be heading to a construction kick-off meeting looking like this. Trying a new blade this morning was an incredibly stupid idea.",

Nacet was back in good form with just a single day's growth. Trying Santa Paula by CF for first time.\n\n#### ❧ Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Gillette - Sheraton 1938 ::: Gillette - Nacet ‹132 uses›)*\n\nComfortable enough for first pass, then smooth after that. Nice close shave.\n\nNot much tugging and no irritation.\n\n#### ❧ Soap Notes\n*^(Chiseled Face - Santa Paula)*\n\nThem: \"An all natural blend of Petitgrain, Siberian Fir, Bitter Orange, Clary Sage, Litsea Cubeba, Siam Wood, and Cedar. This one is light and airy..\"\n\n1/4 tsp soap + lightly-wet boar brush + 2 tsp water = 5 passes of spot-on slick and creamy lather.\n\nScent: orange dominant, but I can pick up a bit of the sage and/or cedar and that helps to dirty up the orange a bit. I like it.\n\nScent Strength: 4-5/10, lightly present during shaving.\n\nBowl - I used the XL version of this bowl:\nhttps://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3392930\n\n#### ❧ Brush Notes\n*^(Semogue - 1250 Boar‹11 uses›)*\n\nThis guy's awesome. medium backbone and soft enough tips to make the action comfy.\n\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Cut flush to where I just see the tips (above average for me)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm)\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

It took me a minute to wake up and realize what was going on. I was being paged by Hyderabad because my team deployed a bad change at the end of the day yesterday and thus caused a super high severity issue. I was on the conference call with people around for two hours while one of my engineers rolled back the deployment and verified that everything which had been broken was once again working. And now I'm up again because I have a 9am conference call with folks all over Europe to decide whether or not we're proceeding with a new feature launch.\n\nAnyway, first shave with the ABH Jeffo so I thought I'd make it a Declaration shave. I love Cuir et Epices. It's a great leather scent. I am way too tired to go out and face the day, but I don't really have a choice.",

Today it was Mike's vs Dr John's. Off the puck I prefer the scent of Dr John's however Mike's scent improves once lathered. Speaking of lather I found that Mike's created a thicker lather with slightly more staying power. I applied the Dr John's on the right side of my face and the Mike's on the left. Both had about the same slickness, glide and cushion but both were just average; not the worst I've tired but no where near top tier. In the end the alum told the tale, I had equal burn on both sides of my face. Considering both had relatively equal performance scent is going to be the deciding factor in picking a winner here. I greatly prefer the scent from the Dr John's. The next round I will do a shave off between the Dr John's and my Martin de Candre Original to determine which I'm keeping.

Northwest wind 5 to 10 mph. High tide at 4:33 this afternoon.\n\nNormally when Theme Thursdays are a Floral theme I tend to go with Catalan's Prairie as it a great sping/summer floral, nice and bright. But was going through the collection for another floral and came across Necromantic, a darker, earthier floral. And it seemed to fit with the theme and my mood today.\n\nI received this soap/splash from /u/MadDingersYo during the Wetshaving Secret Santa. I think I've used it once, maybe twice since then. I can blame the wife, because she's not a fan of the scent, but I could have used it more. And right now I wish I had been using it more. Every day I read people raving about it, and now I can add my own ravings to the crowd. Great base, fatty feeling, slickness is very nice, and residual slickness is great.\n\nScent is absolutely phenomenal. When Southern Witchcrafts first launched I'd held off on picking up any of the line as everything seemed to have \"Red Wine\" as a note and I don't like the smell of wine. I got to smell a sample when /u/phteven_j was offering to send out samples to get people to try them (this was back in the version 1 days). Palm lathered (which sounds like slang for jerking off) and fell in love.\n\nOverall a fantastic shave this morning. Hope everyone has a fantastic day!",

Going back to the 102 after the Ming Shi yesterday was just such an experience. A much more enjoyable and effective shave.\n\nContinuing my never-ending sample journey I picked up some from Castle Forbes recently. Being a cream it lathers faster than a soap and the performance is excellent. Lots of slickness and glide and a little bit of it goes a long way.\n\nIt's nice to be on theme for once with a floral scent today. The CF lavender scent does exactly what it says on the tin. It's the scent of pure unadulterated lavender essential oil. I followed it up with L'Occitan because I prefer my lavender adulterated.",

Its a great soap base with a nice scent, however I just order a tub of After the Rain so its not a niche I need to fill at the moment.\n\nAlso the first time using the Cryogen sample too and its way colder than I remember the soap being! As my face is getting used to it I think my brain thinks the rest of my head is too hot, my ears feel very warm at the moment!\n\nOverall a great shave!",

I started off the morning with dipping my boar bristle in warm water and taking a shower. Being groggy as I was, I exfoliated a bit with a scrub. And climbed out for a shave.\n\n​\n\nMind you, I've only recently started trying to lather on my face instead of a bowl. That was due to seeing multiple comments that the bowl is very much optional and there might be benefits to lathering on the face, since I'm still trying to dial in my technique and my lather quality is all over the place usually. So feeling it on my face the whole time would probably give me a better idea.\n\nSo after a quick brush over with loaded soap onto my face and a warm towel soak on the face (I forget how that method was called), I started my lathering proper. I was pretty determined to not make any shortcuts and focus on my lather technique.\n\nNeedless to say, after a while of brushing my face over and over again it started to sting a little. 'Oh', I thought to myself, 'this is the brush-burn that I've read about'. But I didn't think anything of it-just gonna do one less pass than usual and try to be careful.\n\n​\n\nLong story short, I fucked my face up real good, my cheeks got swollen and burned like hell - I barely completed one pass and pulled out. I had loss of feeling on the area to touch and a constant low stinging throughout the whole day. Any sort of soothing product, or plain water in-fact, just irritated my face. Went to sleep on my back, so as to not touch my pillow or anything else, it was that bad.\n\nToday it's feeling ok, but I'll probably hold off on shaving for a couple of days.\n\nRespect the brush, folks.",

During the drive in to work, I couldn't help staring at all the red lines on my upper lip and neck. Those spots proved a bit tender today. I've had this sample of Mayflower for about 2 years now, and it fits the theme quite well. Heavy on the florals off the puck, I'm waiting to see what develops as the day goes along. The lather took some time to get together, maybe my brush was too wet, maybe the soap was too dry, maybe because it was a sample, all could have an effect.\n\nLife is short, shave with good gear.",

I have a confession. I fell victim to a pretty neat marketing campaign. My wife and I had a snippet of a conversation one night about the new sets coming out that were \"inspired by\" Cool Water and Fahrenheit from Lather Bros and I guess kinda inspired or whatever by the upcoming final season of GoT. I've never previously tried anything from LB but I kept meaning to do this seemed like a neat idea and I wanted to give it a shot. I asked my wife to snag me one since I knew I'd be busy as hell at work the day the preorder opened and told her to surprise me with whichever one she wanted to. Much to my surprise, she got me both. Yeah... not such a great idea in retrospect. I was excited when the package came but, much to my dismay, the SF aftershave had leaked a decent amount out (after emailing the company, I got a discount code for 20% off future orders...). But yeah, not a fan of the scent of that set at all, so I didn't touch it. Just gonna try to sell it unused. I used the HW set today and I'm truly not impressed. I've been spoiled by pretty much every other soap I've ever used. It lathered pretty well, but that's where my positive experience ended. There wasn't much cushion at all and residual slickness was nonexistent. I really did a number on my right cheek before I realized that one. Oh well. Lesson learned. Oh and my face was pretty damn tight and dry afterwards and the splash didn't do much to help with it, so I had to add a bit of moisturizer at the very end. So, in conclusion, I'm not gonna jump head first into an unknown for me like this again. Probably gonna add this set to my bazaar post too if anyone would like to give it a shot themselves.",

SBS soaps lather quite easily so I had lots of thick lather available for the shave. There was decent glide and I really like the residual slickness of this soap as well. Can't do much wrong with SBS.\n\nThe new blade was a little disappointing. It didn't feel sharp enough for me. The blade didn't seem to cut smoothly through my couple days of growth. Don't think I'll be getting too many shaves out of this one but I'll give it a few more tries.\n\nSo far, my top blade has been the Astra SP followed by Voshkod. I don't think I'd consider the Big Ben again.",

So much for April rain showers, but such is life during early spring in Michigan. The shave was much better than the weather however thanks to the excellent lather provided by WKDM whipped up with my B7. I wish WK scents weren't so hit or miss because this is still one of the best bases available. I'm a big fan of earthy type scents, but this one is kinda \"meh\" for me. Thinking about PIFing it as it was PIFed to me (thanks again u/ItchyPooter!) Happy almost Friday all!",

New-to-me Wolfman .54 performed just as I hoped it would. This is the gap that I like! Efficient, but mostly comfortable and smooth.\n\nI also tried out a new soap, that ended up to be a dud. Humphrey's is basically unscented.\n\n#### ❧ Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Wolfman - WR1 Solid Bar .54 Brushed ::: Gillette - Silver Blue ‹1 uses›)*\n\nWonderful shave at the perfect aggression for me. Nice and comfy, but excellent closeness. I'll look forward to using this razor for many years to come.\n\nNo tugging or irritation.\n\n#### ❧ Soap Notes\n*^(Humphrey's Handmade - Kraken)*\n\nThis glycerin soap fails to hit the mark in most categories. Not bad... it's just that we have so many better options. And this is with a soap that I've tried another scent of. So it just seems to be typical with this maker. For $8, I thought it was worth a try. But after the fact, I like Col Conk better... and it's cheaper.\n\n75 second load with lightly-wet boar brush + 3.5 tsp water = 4 passes of usable, but not remarkable lather.\n\nScent: standard, fresh aquatic\n\nScent Strength: 2/10, not really present during shaving. Pretty much unscented.\n\nBowl - I used the XL version of this bowl:\nhttps://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3392930\n\n#### ❧ Brush Notes\n*^(Semogue - 2000 Boar‹9 uses›)*\n\ncontinue to love this brush. Lots of bristles, soft tips, nice massage action. Holds lather well. In one more use, I'll have this guy caught up with the other members of the Boar-a-thon.\n\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Smooth\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Very Close Shave\n*Neck*: Cut flush to where I just see the tips (above average for me)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm)\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

Loser I know. First time posting using the SOTD tool at trythatsoap.com. ⁣ ⁣\n\nFinally got to give Bell Ringer a go. I get a mild scent level off the puck which is mostly mango with a citrus kick. It's very nice and a few of my circle agreed after I shoved the tub in their face and demanded feedback. ⁣\n\n⁣Lather works up very easy and looks amazing. I like the new base and I got a very comfortable three pass shave. ⁣ ⁣\n\nPost shave wasn't drying and my face was left very smooth. I decided to go with the matching splash alone to see how everything feels. Two hours in and my skin is very smooth and hydrated. There is zero tacky feel and the scent remains very clearly. ⁣ ⁣\n\nI'm very pleased with this soap and splash. The zesty mango really is a great pick me up and will be in my regular rotation.",

It's about as close as my cologne collection gets to being floral or aquatic right now.\n\nFirst time trying out a Rapira blade and the Swedish Supersteel is certainly at the mild end of the blade spectrum. It basically reminds me of Derby Extra: it works, it's tuggy, and it's bad ATG. Worked a lot better than that awful Big Ben I used yesterday, but not well enough to try it in another razor. I already know it isn't going to compete with my better blades.",

Should've used the Tres Matres, but didn't read up beforehand.\n\nA nice CCS with almost zero irritation. However, I definitely need more practice with my boar brush. I had all kinds of issues dialing in a proper lather last night, but it didn't really effect my shave in the end. Glad to see I had the same issue with Stirling and the boar brush as the first time I tried to use the Southern Witchcrafts soap though. At least it confirms that I need more practice with my brush. Considering it's been almost 3 weeks since I've used it, I should probably try to get it in the rotation more.",

      "body": "Theme Thursday 4/11 SOTD\n\n* Razor: GEM Flying Wing, aka Bullet Tip, 40s /50s vintage\n* Blade: GEM PTFE (10)\n* Brush: Simpson 23mm Duke 3 Best\n* Soap: Tallow & Steel, Rain Forest, tallow V1 base\n* Post: Duke Cannon Ice Cold balm\n* Frag: Guerlain Habit Rouge EDT\n\nProduct Notes:\n\n* **Theme:** Is there spring in a rainforest? I dunno - someone was sleeping through numerous science and geography classes. Anyhoo, a great earthy scent - not much floral, but certainly woods and grasses at their dominant peaks are sniffed in here, and the overall mood is certainly one of vivacious renewal and rampant bloom.\n* **Razor**: Retiring blade and razor after this shave for a bit. Shaving monogamy for ten days gets dull! (Unlike regular monogamy. Ahem.) Still, the Flying Wing proved its worth, offering a highly competitive shave vis a vis my newer and pricier Blacklands Sabre. The Bullet Tip has more versatility and less chatter than many other vintage GEMs due to the butterfly blade retention, which has aged well over time.\n* **Soap**: Sigh. I have parted ways with the brand, so this is nostalgia of the most painful sort. The V1 base was OK, quite similar to B&M White Label, but the scent is the draw here. Unlike my five V2 soaps, the scent has aged well over time, and is still very crisp and distinct. The RF scent is very springlike, having an earthy / vegetal smell along with heavy woods notes. The overall scent is imaginative, unique, and well designed. A shame that the brand changed scent designers after this first generation!",

I like it.\n\n#### ❧ Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Gillette - Sheraton 1938 ::: Gillette - Nacet ‹133 uses›)*\n\ncomfy shave. Nacet just churning the uses out.\n\nA little tugging on the first pass, but really very minimal. No irritation at all.\n\n#### ❧ Soap Notes\n*^(Declaration Grooming - Bison Fourth & Pine)*\n\nSo many flavors of orange family represented here. Lather was dialed in nicely today. I love the Bison base.\n\n30 second load with lightly-wet boar brush + 2.5 tsp water = 5 passes of perfect, creamy, super-slick lather.\n\nScent: several facets of orange in this one, with grapefruit too, that are tempered and matured by the lavender and pettigrain. Very nice scent. Keeping this one around for sure.\n\nScent Strength: 6/10, very (and enjoyably) present during shaving.\n\nBowl - I used the XL version of this bowl:\nhttps://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3392930\n\n#### ❧ Brush Notes\n*^(Semogue - 1305 Boar‹11 uses›)*\n\nNot as comfy as the 2000 Semogue at this stage, but it has less hairs and they are shorter. Nice to use, though.\n\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Cut flush to where I just see the tips (above average for me)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm)\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

It is super soft like a cream but I loaded from the tub anyway. The soap is thirsty and creates a light but substantial lather, it reminded me of whipped cream. A very slick soap with fantastic secondary slickness and a decent postshave. The scent wasn't very strong nor awesome but nice.",

It's my gift to myself from this year's bonus. I feel like it's nice to have something tangible from a bonus so it doesn't just disappear into the regular bill paying and such.\n\nI've been looking at artisan razors for a while. There are very few European artisans making CNC machined razors, and with this being a majority American sub you hear about them here even less. The small amount that I'd read here and elsewhere about the Masamune was very positive though. Brexit was potentially imminent at the time that I ordered and that gave me an extra incentive to get one while the UK was still in the customs union.\n\nBetween Tatara and Pereira, wet shaving seems to be flourishing in Portugal.\n\nSo it arrived. It's a beautiful piece of industrial design. The matt finish is lovely and the balance of it feels right. The extra recessing of the handle into the head compared to a standard 3 piece makes the action of screwing it closed feel more definite and secure. I love the detailing on the base plates with the logo and production number. And that the production number on my OC and SB plates is the same, despite them selling OC and SB plates separately.\n\nHaving picked up both the OC and SB plates with it, I decided to start out slow with the SB plate and a Shark blade I had on the go already. It gave a lovely mild and efficient shave. I found it straightforward to find the right angle, with good audio feedback once I found it. It was an easy three passes. Even on the neck where I don't normally do XTG it was very smooth. It really impressed on the ATG pass for me too. The end result was DFS with BBS in places.\n\nI'm looking forward to trying out the OC plate and a Feather (it came with 3 Feathers, so I'm taking that as a suggestion).\n\nCastle Forbes 1445 performed great. It's quick and easy to build a beautiful lather from it. Does it justify being 60% more expensive than other, similarly performant soaps? Probably not but it's very nice to use nonetheless. I'm not sold on the scent - I'm not sure whether it's the patchouli or the vetiver that bothers me, but there's a note there that I don't get on with.\n\nHave a great Friday all!",

Life has just been going 100 mph and the days/weeks have been flying by. Between trying to sell a property I own 6 hours away from where I live, work, and trying to raise a family; I don't know which way is up. I had to mow the yard after I got home from work yesterday because it's going to rain all weekend, and I have to work 7 straight 12 hour shifts next week. Between the pollen and having to rush to finish before dark, it was a less than enjoyable experience.\n\nNice refreshing shave this morning. My wife got me MITA for Christmas a few years ago and while I don't love it, I definitely don't hate it. It's a refreshing change of pace in a fun scent. Happy Friday.",

The shave wasn't bad, but it was a tad bit irritating. I've had a lot better shaves with a lot less lather.

I'm also filled with a little bit of dread but I'll get to that later. This morning I'm grateful for this community. There's some great people in the wetshaving community. It's not without its drama, but I'm a firm believer if you surround yourself with positivity that positivity will spread in a chain reaction with impacts you never intended.\n\nSpeaking of positivity, this morning I'm shaving with Mammoth \"Almond Leather\". The soap and scent are awesome and in my opinion legitimately hype worthy. But beyond that, the owner Ben puts his money where his mouth is and backs some great non-profit organizations for each purchase of soap and via raffles that he does for soap sets and custom brushes from some big names in the shaving world. Of note, Ben will occasionally announce via Instagram \"[Gold Label](https://youtu.be/6AicW3Xp9EM)\" soaps. The soaps drop randomly and according to his website no more than 10 tubs will be made per scent. What's even better though is that 50% of the purchase price is donated to organizations that fight human trafficking.\n\nSo the on the topic of the actual soap itself, Try that Soap lists the scent notes as Leather, Almond, Orange Blossom, Frankincense. I love leather scents, NO Flying Hide, APR Fenchurch and Maggards Tobacco Leather all occupy room in my collection. This is a warm leather scent with some marzipan almond sweetness and a little bit of orange peel and mulling spice. It's fairly straightforward as far as the Mammoth scents go unlike Mood Indiglo or Hygge. Don't confuse straight forward for a knock though, it's not. It smells fantastic and is medium in strength. The leather smells soft but is the strongest note, balanced with sweeter undertones from the ampm's and orange.\n\nThe base is built around tallow and duck fat that was on the softer side of most soaps and didn't need a lot of water to lather but following the third pass I tried downing it and it was very forgiving with how much water it could take before breaking down. The lather was not dense, but was very slick and post shave my skin felt great and I could easily go without AS. I finished off the shave with some Noble Otter \"Flying Hide\" to play up the leather and then finished off with some John Varvados \"Dark Rebel Rider\".\n\nIn other news, I made mention about dread in my opening comments. In the next couple of days I will have to drive up to Sacramento. My step mother is in the process of selling her house and moving to Wyoming. It's great that she's moving and I'm sure she will have no problems selling her property. I'm filled with dread because I need to help her go though the last of my fathers things that's sitting in boxes in her garage. My dad died about three years ago. I know we have both been putting it off for a while but there's no more time. It feels like me driving out there has a finality to it. Cancer sucks and the fact that my dad is not around to see his grandkids grow up or that my kids never knew him makes me angry and sad. I really don't want to go out there, but I will because it's the right thing to do.\n\nHave a Good Friday Y'all, for those attending the NYC Expo this weekend, have a great time.\n\nRobot",

Suck it TSN) This soap is a thirsty mofo. I used the Marco Method^(TM) and still had to add some water after face lathering, but the resulting lather was nothing short of amazing. Thick, slick, glossy and super dense. Just a fantastic shave and scent today. I think of this as a cold weather type of fragrance, but it's so good I'll probably use whenever I feel like it cuz that's how I roll. Herod finishes this one off nicely and keeps the tobacco-y goodness going. A great pairing IMO. Good shaves and happy Friday everyone!",

The Chicks feel a bit smoother than the Personna, but not dramatically so. Ended up with a close to BBS after two passes.\n* Cons: Difficulty loading the blade again - I am 2 for 4 so far in terms of smooth blade loading, which, to me, is one of the main reasons to use an Injector based system. The key (guide) is where it should be, and then the blade stops about 3/4 of the way through the push feed, and I have to loosen the plate and insert it the rest of the way by hand. Not the end of the world, but adds some time and frustration to the process.\n* Also cons: the Injector blade feels nowhere near as efficient as GEM or AC, and it is also smaller in width than either, making for a pretty slow shave. It took me about an extra 3 mins to get semi-BBS, and a lot of touchup was needed. The much more modern AC feels like it comes from a different century, and even Ye Olde GEM is a better blade intrinsically. The Injector works, but does not seem optimal compared to other SEs or even a mid range aggression DE.\n* Final con: little screw holds all together. Might some fat fingered clumsy dolt like meself drop that teeny screw down the sink drain one day? It seems all too possible. Avoid removing or loosening the plate within 10 feet of a drain or you may end up needing a new part.\n* All in all, I liked the Supply. The Level II plate is probably too mild for most users (and Level I is apparently for Boy Scouts' first shaves) but I don't feel like shelling out more cash for the Level III kit. The matte SS handle is gorgeous and well made, and the design feels like it should cost more than it does. I think Supply is pricing the unit low because they understand that the Injector will not be a first choice blade for many. I'll run with it for a bit and see how long the blade lasts.",

We really don't deserve /u/hawns. If there's one thing he does extremely well, is give us things that are **different**. Lamplight, Sni, 3 Sheets, even Taum Sauk. Sure, he's got Fougeres, Citrus, Leather and Tobacco scents and all that, but where he seems to excel is when he's having fun creating what I believe he calls \"photorealistic\".\n\nWest Egg scared me a bit. Champagne? Am I going to smell like i went off on a bender, fell asleep, and woke up with flat champagne leaked on my clothes? I mean that might be cool too, maybe there are places I could pull that off, but not generally. In reality, what /u/hawns did was somehow deliver me a bottle that has alcohol in it, that smells like Champagne or white grapes, without smelling boozy. My theory created in the last 2 minutes is that it smells like Champagne because i'm looking for it. If you smell it slowly, there's the grapefruit, the white grapes, and a definite soapy smell i'm getting, with i presume the aldehydes bringing it together for the champagne. That I suspect is what other people will pick up who don't hang out on shaving message boards will pick up who are near me, a nice soapy white grape, with some grapefruit around.\n\nKudos also to /u/reguyw_nothingtolose. Looking forward to seeing what the scentmaster at SW has up her sleeve.",

Fantastic stuff. I really like the inclusion of a tomato leaf note, really encapsulates the summer vibe for me. Haven't cracked open the AS yet though, always like to do a couple test runs with a soap first. Plus, maybe I can use it as bait for a Sweet Lemon soap ;)\n\nGreat tunes, as always. Can't pick a favorite Beatles record, but my God, Abbey Road is note for note perfection in my book. Heard it a thousand times, and it never ceases to amaze me.\n\nSham on, folks. Happy Friday.",

It's a 28mm Maggard SHD knot in a Dogwood phandle from a Butcher blank. I set the knot myself, so it will probably be falling back out within the first 5 uses. But you gotta learn somehow, right?\n\nGreat shave with the WK lather. Argumi in Estate is a very sharp citrus scent... not sweet at all. It smells kinda like the stuff the janitor used to clean my elementary school. It's almost institutional in a way. But I like it.\n\nPressure is off somewhat at work as my team managed to finally get the new feature into Prod last night. Now we just have to catch our breath and prepare to dial it up so it is available to all our customers next week.",

When you have great products, just stand by and let them do the work. Still maintain that Bison > Icarus, and that's a hill I'm willing to die on, but I guess ymmv ;)I think the Deltus aftershave may just be my favorite part of the reformulation. Much as I enjoy my reserve aftershave, this is on another level. Also the first time I've actually enjoyed this Fanchurian. Maybe it's finally softening up a bit after some uses, or maybe my skin was just irritated when trying to use it prior. Whatever the reason, I hope this trend continues, b/c I love this brush and would like to put some more miles on it.\n\nHappy weekend shaves everybody!",

I can actually get a good shave using the derby's if I bowl later. My fave lather ends up too dry.\n\nLoved the splash too.

For real. I've been getting nothing but smooth shaves from it. It's dethroned my Paradigm Ti II. I'm going to use the Paradigm next week, and see how I feel about it. I might just sell it.\n\n\nHave I spoken about this brand before? In the beginning there was a lot of talk about Murphy & McNeil. Especially on YouTube. Such a nee artisan was making waves in the community. I didn't really pay attention to them until JR. Reyes from Reyes restores contacted me on Instagram.\n\nHe's restored 2 of my brushes in the past, and he's a great guy to work with. He asked me if Id be interested in preordering a limited edition soap dedicated to him. So I jumped on board.\n\n\nBoy, am I not disappointed. This is probably the best Aventes clone I have used. The scent on the both the soap and aftershave are mid strong, but the scent on the aftershave last a long time! My only complaint is that the aftershave is really oily from the glycerine, but it dries down quickly.\n\nThe soap base is in their Slainte base, which is mutton tallow, duck fat, and beef tallow. The soap is a pretty soft consistency. Not a cream, not a croap, just a soft soap. It's really thirsty as well, but it builds a dense, thick, and slick lather. The post shave feel is amazing as well.\n\nOverall, Solid product.",

The Super Speed and Yaqi brush are really great. After this blade is kaput I'll change it up and try a Feather blade for funsies.\n\nMeanwhile, back at the ranch: We should be finishing up this frac tonight. This job has been pretty frustrating due to lack of communication from the pressure pumping company and training a new guy, but I got through it without any problems. Lightning storm is inbound on top of rain and 34°F temp so this job may drag out to 4am instead of midnight.",

Two Pass + Two Clean ups. WTG, XTG/ATG, and Two ATG clean ups. The brush feels great but it just doesn't hold enough lather for me. Soap is good but not the greatest.\n\n**The Soap** worked well. The scent is growing on me so it's bearable now. It's more of a clean scent rather than the strong basil scent. The performance is great but a little above average for me. It gives good slickness and protection but the brush did skimp me out a bit. Not the soap's fault though.\n\n**The Razor and Blade** combination was good. Sharp enough and smooth throughout the shave. During the last cleanup, it did drag a tiny bit but that was because of the thin layer of lather. I should've went back to the puck but was lazy and didn't do it. Otherwise, a good combination that mowed down the three day growth with just couple passes.\n\n**The Brush** was good but a bit disappointing. The 1250 tends to eat up lather like no other so I overload on the puck most of the time. I loaded for 40 seconds today and it seemed like a good amount at first. But by the second pass, the lather was thinning out. By the clean up pass, there was almost nothing left to work with. The brush works well but I just can't seem to get enough lather to last to the end. Next time, I'll load for 50 seconds and see if that's better.\n\n**The aftershave portion** was great. Light With Hazel matched with a Ice-Kicking aftershave balm. However, the scent on the balm is a bit polarizing. Not for me but for the members of my household. I did put on a bit more than usual and it seem to turn off some people. I don't mind it but I should put on a little less next time.\n\nOverall, a good shave. I usually don't shave at night but I do have an early morning tomorrow. I would rather sleep that extra time and step out in time. The shave went well except for the brush. I still need to figure out how to get enough lather to last the shave. Maybe I should load until I see a thick paste instead of setting a time for it. I'm planning to use up the soap anyways so I don't mind it. As for future shaves, I'll change up the brushes but keep a relatively similar set up.",

Recently received a Fitjar Islands shaving cream sampler set, so I thought why not give it a spin.\n\n​\n\nAnd boy, was there a lot of spinning. I don't have much experience with different soaps and creams, I started off with an EJ cream, then tried a soap, now it's a cream again. I probably went through half of the jar trying to work up a lather-t'was bubbly and foamy and completely nothing like it was advertised.\n\n​\n\nBut I kept at it, and only on like my 5th try I tried a practically dry brush and it slowly started creaming up in my bowl. Afterwards, it was smooth sailing, my smoothest sailing to date, actually. The cream has a lot of cushion and quite enough slickness to lull you into a false sense of security really quickly.\n\n​\n\nThe scent is described as \"Like coming into safe harbour after a rough day at sea\". And I would tend to agree, I could smell salt water and wet wood, I even put on a harbour sounds soundtrack in the background to make the most out of the effect.\n\n​\n\nI think I had a bit of a teaser on how a premium shaving product feels like, I would just like to learn the water/cream ratio to save it a bit so I could enjoy it more.",

Time will tell. It's certainly smooth and efficient enough to be my new daily driver. I think it's time to ditch the Shark and try a Feather tomorrow. It's on the mild side so I suspect it will benefit from a sharper blade.\n\nMy first Soap Commander sample, and honestly it performed better than I expected. Not the slickest, most cushioning lather ever, but still perfectly decent, especially for the price. I enjoyed the scent a fair bit - it's woody but also floral with a bit of peppercorn spiciness.\n\nHave a great weekend all!",

I was opening my mail and someone that I previously traded with unpronounced sent me a penny sample of Dr. Jon's flowers in the dark. As you might know from my previous SOTD posts, my biggest issue with Dr. Jon shave soap is that the scent is usually weak. Not so much with flowers in the dark though. I was pleasantly surprised and looking forward to a future shave with it. I think it's going back onto my want to trade for list.\n\nI'm not much of a Sandalwood guy, however several of the guys on IRC swear by Santal Auster. Thanks to /u/Urfrendlipiro (creator of TryThatSoap) I was able to acquire a set. As I said before, I'm not a fan of Sandalwood but, I do like declaration grooming and chatty lux. I got the soap a few days back but today was the first opportunity I had to shave with it. Scent was very strong off of the puck and remain that way throughout the shave. I've said in previous posts that in my opinion a shave so can go one of two routes. The first route is a direct representation of a scent. The second route is more of a idealized view of it. To me, Santal Auster is a direct representation of Sandalwood. It's equal parts rich, woody, creamy and powdery. I find the scent to be bold and classically masculine. Of all the sandalwood soap's I've used it feels the most natural.\n\nSantal Auster soap base is declaration grooming Icarus. Some have described the base as having some animalistic notes from the mix of Bison Tallow, Lamb Tallow and Goats Milk. This personally has never bothered me and the overall quality of the lather from Icarus is dense, slick and extremely moisturizing. It is one of my favorite soap bases currently on the market.\n\nI'm still don't like Sandalwood. However I am somewhere middle of the road for this soap and to my surprise I am actually leaning towards liking it because it feels so genuine. On the topic of sandalwood soap's I am still looking for Talbot Shaving Iliahi Ridge and of you have some and are willing to trade, let me know.\n\nIn other News, my family is coming back into town today. My wife and kids have been visiting the grandparents in Texas for the last two weeks and I'm really looking forward to seeing them again. I won't lie I've been living like a bachelor and the last two weeks of been a whirlwind for me between going to LA for work and then pulling a couple extra shifts at home. Despite the fact that I cleaned the house right after they left I somehow let it get messy again all by myself. I think there's a lesson in that. I was all by myself in the house and it got messy and yet sometimes I'll come home from work and see the house is messy and get irritated at my wife despite the fact that she's having to chase after a one-year-old and a four-year-old. I think I could do a better job of showing her some grace and recognizing that we all have our struggles and to not put such unreasonable expectations on her.\n\nHave a good Saturday y'all!\n\n-Robot",

I got as smooth a shave as can be had and it felt really great. I was left with a fair amount of post shave dryness but my skin feels very smooth. I'm not quite sure on the fragrance of this soap. Maybe it's the bitterness of the neroli I'm picking up, but if someone asked me if it smelled like a street, I'd say yes. Sort of dusty or something. I have a sample of the EdC coming so I'm curious to see what I pick up from that.\n\nI've been exploring the world of fragrances which has a an online community with many similarities to our own. Lemon Lime Mancera pairs fantastically with my citrus scented shaving soaps. With a top of lemon, orange and Lavender, a heart of amber and white flowers, and a base of white musk, and oak moss it smells so fresh and makes me happy. I'd imagine a soap with similar scent notes would be quite popular.\n\nI am a busy busy boy and haven't had the time to participate with you guys as much as I like. I still scan through the threads whenever I need a moment to relax. Have a great weekend.",

First impression - this things stinks. Wet the brush and it gets worse! Lol. The hair on this one feels softer than the two-band and less backbone makes it easier for me to face lather. The brush needs some serious cleaning time - I had shampooed it a few times and it lost a few hairs. Even let soap sit in it for a while. The stench remained but I'm okay shaving with it. All sorts of funky stuff keeps coming out of it turning my soak water and lather, brown. Another little niggle for the handle: the bottom is not completely flat so it wobbles a bit when stood upright. Still a fantastic brush though.\n\nLather: I haven't used Seville in a while so this shave was a nice return to this awesome scent (and lather). I had never face lathered with this one before and it made for such a nice, slick lather.\n\nThe big ben blade is disappointing. It feels like the Voshkod after several shaves - just doesn't seem sharp or smooth for me. I think this one will go into the 'do not buy again' pile.\n\nIt's good to be back to Playoff season. Leafs are playing tonight, Raps are playing tonight. I need to find a way to get away from the SO during this time.\nHave a good Saturday!",

The post shave of this soap base is excellent, and The AOS sandalwood scent complemented the woody notes of the soap rather well.

Splash + Duke Cannon's Ice Cold Balm\n\n**A Good shave.** A decent shave with a slight irritation because of my stubbornness. Two Pass + Two Clean ups. WTG, XTG/ATG, and Two ATG clean ups. The brush worked a lot better today and I had enough lather to work with. The razor combo remains to be mild so I gotta watch out for that.\n\n**The Soap** worked well. Nothing spectacular but it gives me a good shave. It does slightly irritate my skin towards the clean up pass but nothing major. It is slick and creamy and provides me a good lather to work with. Again, the scent is not my favorite but it'll do.\n\n**The Razor and Blade** combination was good. However, the more I use this setup, the more I desire a BBS. It just doesn't hit that extra straggler hairs that I have. If I am shaving with this setup, I cannot have a goal of a BBS. It will irritate my skin trying to achieve BBS. I keep need to remind myself that this is to reduce my beard, not remove the whole thing. Aside from that rant, it worked well but not the cleanest of the shaves.\n\n**The Brush** worked well today. Unlike yesterday, I loaded until I visually saw a whole glob of lather mixed in well in the brush. And lo behold, I had enough lather for the whole shave. It did its job well and it felt great at exfoliating my face. It made a creamy lather and overall, I continue to love this brush.\n\n**The aftershave portion** was great. The TASS Humidor splash is a controversial one for me because of its scent. It has a strong woody, tobacco, vanilla scent that I hated at first. I'm slowly getting used to it but I do not think my family will enjoy the scent. Same goes with the Ice Cold Balm. I'm simply wearing it inside my home and reserving it mostly for nights so that my face is well moisturized and the scent is kept to myself.\n\nOverall, a good shave. The lather was a lot better today and I'm continuing to break in the boar. It's almost broken in but it could use a tad more splits. As for the razor, I'll use it for a comfortable but non-BBS shave. It is a good razor but a clean look, it does not work well for me. And the aftershave scents are polarizing but I can make it work. I enjoyed this shave and I'll probably rest shaving for couple days to give my face a rest.",

The balm was a necessity choice as I got interrupted by a crying toddler who wanted their teeth brushed, so I reached for the first thing I had that somewhat fit. It turns out letting a toddler tell you where you've missed washing off soap is a great way to calm them down.\n\nThis is the 3rd or 4th shave with this badger brush and it produced a great lather really easily. I have no idea if my Muhle synth just isn't great (it's very floppy and doesn't seem very dense) or just I got lucky today. I'll keep experimenting.",

A good shave but I got a little to experimental / gung-ho on the ATG pass on my neck. Must remember to take it easier tomorrow.\n\nRussian Leather mimics the scent of Imperial Leather soap which I suspect most Brits of my generation will be familiar with. It's been a while since I last smelled Imperial Leather but this certainly evokes it for me. Mild, floral and inoffensive. I guess I'm pot committed to sampling every Wickham scent now.\n\nI did lots of IKEA assembly and disassembly yesterday as our daughter is now old enough to sleep in her own room. It feels like a pretty big milestone. I'm hoping for a slightly less labour-intensive day today!\n\nHope you're all having a good weekend!",

Seems to be a good match for any DE I use. I enjoy a good citrus scent and Bell Ringer does not disappoint. It honestly reminds me of the first couple chews of a juicy fruit. The aftershave is more complex and the scent is more rind than fruit for me. This is my first Summer Break Soaps, and I'm thoroughly impressed. Easy to lather, very dense, sour cream like lather. Post shave was the star for me, still a soft face hours later.\n\nPlini is an instrumental pro-metal/fusion guitarist and satisfies my nerdy guitar player side. Songs range from chill to thrash, often within the same piece. I do enjoy songs that are a journey, not unlike a complex fragrance.",

Increasing clouds, with a high near 56. Calm wind becoming southeast around 5 mph in the afternoon. New precipitation amounts of less than a tenth of an inch possible. High tide at 7:40 this evening.\n\nAfter learning that Maggard's now carries Martin de Candre I felt the urge to pull out my tub. Almost everyone I know has said that the post shave on this soap is drying. When I first started using it I was inclined to agree but then someone here told me to load it like you hate it and absolutely drown it in water. And I mean HATE LOAD, like you want another soap but can't get one until you kill this tub and you have like four shaves left and you want to use all of the soap today. When I say drown it make like you are trying to resuscitate a fish who is stuck on dry land. Sure following this method means you will end up with enough lather to shave a yeti, but the post shave won't leave you dry like the Gobi Desert.\n\nThe scent is great, sharp citrus with just a hint of sweetness. This is the sort of citrus I could get in a matching splash. Maybe MLS Paradise Frost would work well, but I only just thought about that. Went with Wholly Kaw - Dance of Agrumes which seems to bring an entire other level to the scent. It brings the tart down with some earthiness. Over all a great pair of scents.\n\nHave a nice Sunday everyone!",

The aldehydes or whatever notes have been used bring out that chilled bubbly white wine vibe, it's pretty cool, as I didn't know what to expect.\n\nThe performance of the soap is great too. A dense and cushiony lather with solid slickness and residual slickness. Using a sharp new polsilver meant I ended up opening a couple tiny weepers from before, but the Chatillon Lux aftershave has absolutely no problem clearing that up and adding a dose of moisture to my skin.\n\nAll in all a great experience. After a few more uses I'll have more to report. Hope to see more posts on this as the spring progresses!\n\nBring on the valley of ashes!!",

      "body": "**2019-04-14 Weekend SOTD**\n\n**Prep:** Took a warm shower, shaved with cool water\n\n**Brush:** Yaqi 24mm Moka Express (Synthetic)\n\n**Lather:** Stirling Pharaoh's Dreamsicle\n\n**Razor:** 1955 Ball-end Tech\n\n**Blade:** Derby Premium (shave #1)\n\n**Post:** Stirling Unscented Post-Shave Balm\n\n**Fragrance:** Dunshire by Stirling (Acqua di Gio inspired, more sweet and fruity)\n\n**Thoughts:**\n\nNew brush! Yaqi finally started shipping most of their brushes to Canada so I picked up a Moka Express for cheap. I previously auditioned a borrowed 30mm SynBad / Mew Brown brush and found it way too big for my face, but the knot felt so nice I decided to find one in the 22-24mm range. The [Moka Express](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/Yaqi-24mm-Moka-Express-Synthetic-Hair-Shaving-Brush/32867063088.html) handle was based on [the coffee pot I use](https://www.google.com/search?q=moka+express&tbm=isch), so it seemed like the logical choice!\n\nThe knot itself has enough backbone to keep its shape and not go all floppy once you start using it. It might have been nicer set 1-2mm higher in the handle like the 30mm brush, which was a little easier to splay. The tips are so soft it's like lathering with a cloud, making it excellent for my scritch-hating skin. The handle... well, it isn't the longest or heaviest brush handle in my collection, but it's friggin fat. Wide. Rotund. The photos I've seen did not do its thickness justice. It will take some getting used to.\n\nAnyway, paired with some Stirling soap, it whipped up a gorgeous lather with a whipped-cream-like consistency. It loaded surprisingly well for a synthetic brush, I thought. Very happy with its performance... If the handle was about 20% smaller and the knot was set a wee bit higher, I would be tempted to call it a perfect brush for my tastes.\n\nSpeaking of soap, Pharaoh's Dreamsicle is awesome. It smells the way orange Tic-Tacs taste: pure sweet orange candy. Delicious. I paired it up with some Dunshire, which is much sweeter than the original AdG (which basically smells like dryer sheets to me).\n\nI've been working through my \"mild blade\" samples recently. It has not been much fun: I don't need the world's sharpest blades to get a comfortable shave with my whiskers, but so far the world's dullest blades haven't seemed up to the challenge. Although Lord Classic was a pleasant surprise, Derby Extra, Dorco Titan, Big Ben, and Rapira Swedish Supersteel were big disappointments.\n\nUp next in my box of blades is Derby Premium. It has the same Chromium-Ceramic / platinum / tungsten / polymer / voodoo / dilithium / kyber crystal / mythril coating as the Extra. Refined Shave says [it's marginally sharper](https://www.refinedshave.com/derby-premium-razor-blade-review/) than an Extra. I found it to be much more pleasant with only mild \"scitching your whiskers like an old-timer\" tugging compared to the \"feels like you're tweezing your whiskers out en masse\" tugging I got with the Extras. Finished up with a lovely BBS shave with a little painless buffing.\n\nOverall it gave me good results and was reasonably comfortable, but it wasn't quite as efficient as some of the sharper blades I've tried. I'll give it a shot in my other razors and see how long it lasts.",

However.... it was a little quicker, it was more comfortable, and it gave me more chances to experience the lather. All reasons I may want to repeat in the future, especially if I'm using one of my favorite soaps.\n\nVery comfortable shave and the Nacet just keeps rolling along.\n\n#### ❧ Soap Notes\n*^(Soap Commander - Courage)*\n\nThem: \"Peppercorn, Citrus, Cedar\"\n\n30 second load with lightly-wet boar brush + 2 tsp water = 5 passes of perfect, creamy, slick lather.\n\nScent: was so light, it was hard to pick up anything other than the scent of dried wood with a bit of a cedar nature to it.\n\nScent Strength: 3/10, very lightly present during shaving.\n\nBowl - I used the XL version of this bowl:\nhttps://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3392930\n\n#### ❧ Brush Notes\n*^(Semogue - 2000 Boar‹10 uses›)*\n\ncomfy and enjoyable\n\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Very Close Shave\n*Neck*: Few hairs are showing some tip length (with most being cut flush)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm)\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

I knew this before buying because they're all easy fixes. No handle crack which is a plus. I fixed the baseplate and pinched corners, but couldn't get the top cap perfectly straight. Close enough.\n\nHow did it shave? Horribly! Harsh, like a razor not fully tightened down. The bowed top cap doesn't clamp the blade properly against the now flat baseplate. You can see the bow in the picture. It probably shaved better before I straightened the baseplate. As a test, I popped the blade into my trusty 1906 Single Ring that I got from /u/falcons1583 and yup, smooth as glass.\n\nI would have preferred not to use heat to straighten the top cap because there's a risk to the finish, but if I want to use it, I'll have to anneal it to get it to bend back.\n\nI'm still stoked to finally own this iconic razor. I should have fixed it properly so my first shave would have been awesome.",

Today was thus a coin flip between Fougere Trois and 88 Chestnut Street. The Scent Formerly Known As 4th And Pine won the toss.\n\nOff the tub, 84th and Pinenut was a lot greener than I was expecting. I've heard some folks say it's sweet (too sweet to use two days in a row), but I didn't find the soap to be all that sweet. As expected, the Icarus base lathered up very nicely and provided lots of slickness. Unlike the soap, the aftershave had a good bit of sweetness to it. I definitely caught a couple of whiffs of Froot Loops, though the Saturday morning breakfast cereal edge has kind of mellowed out over the last 40 minutes.\n\nGot our taxes pretty much done yesterday. As expected, we owe money. The pretty little wife will go through them with a fine-toothed comb today to ensure I didn't miss any opportunities to save us money.\n\nOh, and Game of Thrones comes back tonight! Time to head over to [TV Deadpool](https://tvdeadpool.xyz/) to place your fake bets on who will and won't survive the night.",

But the soap, and aftershave smell very much like a bubbly, sweet champagne. I get a very sweet grape note, a little woody. It's fantastic.\n\nNow the EdP, this is interesting. From afar I get the same sweet grape note that I do from the soap. But up close, when I have my wrist right up against my nose it smells musky, almost old. Not saying it's bad, but if that's what the scent is going for, an old scent from back in the day then Shawn really nailed it on the head with this one\n\n\nThis scent would be best worn during a spring, or summer night, I could see wearing it possible during the fall as well. Amazing collaboration.",

Really close and no real nicks or anything. I like bay rum scents, but I'm not sure that I'm in love with them. My wife said she liked the scent, but that it smells like Christmas to her. I guess it's the pine note in the soap, plus the spices. I got a bit of a tingle from the AS but nothing lasting and not bad at all.\n\nT+S performs well for me. Good slickness and post shave. I feel like the only aspect of the shave that isn't quite up to snuff with my top artisans in the residual slickness, and it definitely isn't bad. I've got a few more shaves with T+S coming up, so maybe I'll dial it in better and get more residual slickness.",

Passion is woody but with a good hit of spicy cardamom. Masculine and ... passionate? ̄\\_(ツ)_/ ̄. To me it pairs quite nicely with Cade which I find to be a woody-ish scent.\n\nBoth SC scents I've tried so far have been interesting and different from most other soaps. It has been a really pleasant surprise.",

Another wonderful shave, from a new top soap base. Stirling EMP is supposed to be Executive man with more smokiness, but the extra smoke completely takes over the scent. If they decided to make something in between the two, they'd probably have a very close homage to Aventus.\n\nAll That Remains is a great metal band made popular by this song being on Guitar Hero. I've seen them live a few times, and although I love the songs and riffs, they could never play them very well live. Their lead guitar player was found dead last year, and he was the main writing force, so we'll see how they fair in the future. Virtuoso guitar player Jason Richardson has been filling in on tour, so we'll see if he's a permanent edition to the lineup.",

New precipitation amounts between a quarter and half of an inch possible. High tide at 8:43 this evening.\n\nWas a decent shave. This brush is definitely too big for this container.

Signed her up for Parks & Rec Camp, so have to drop her off there in the mornings instead of going out and waiting for the bus. Usually the wife or I try to take vacation days when she is out of school, but the wife took February vacation so I was going to take this one, but found out that my boss is taking his vacation this week and next week. Which normally wouldn't be an issue but this is the week leading into Easter so we get busy in the meat dept. But she's excited to go, because it's field trips every day, and today is the planetarium.\n\nHave a nice Monday everyone!",

He had pancreatic cancer and fought hard for 10 months, but passed away nearly two years ago. We did not have the most consistent or close relationship most of my life, but bonded a lot in the time after he was diagnosed. He was a cartridge shaver and although he did lather soap with a brush I am not sure what he used to shave, just hand soap I think. He rarely wore cologne or any scent, but when he did it was always Paco Rabanne Sport. He brought it home from Spain in the early 90s and was very excited about it. I distinctly remember that from my young childhood. I inherited his aftershave and EdC after he passed. It is a stong, very herbaceous fougere that really sticks around. It honestly is not my favorite scent, but it does remind me of my dad.\n\n\nI had some trouble finding a good soap to match the scent, most things I tried were far more subtle and clean. I ended up deciding on Fracisco from the Shaving Shop, I think this particular soap was made by Caties Bubbles. If so it is my first Caties Bubbles soap, and the best vegan soap I have used to date. The scent is a clean fernish fougere and quite mild compared to the cologne and splash, but it pairs well. I like the Caties Bubbles base even though I can tell my puck is not the freshest. Very slick, easy lather, and the SynBad knot produced more than I knew what to do with very quickly. I bowl lather but it is very soft when I apply lather to my face. The aftershave splash works but is not as nice as elite offerings loke Noble Otter.\n\nThe MR3 was mild and the Astra SP was smooth as always. It was a good shave to celebrate his memory.\n\nI included a picture of him in the link and even bonus cat tax.",

I like the scent a lot. I get the citrus from the grapefruit and I'm assuming also from the aldehyde. I'm guessing Citral or possibly C13? Both? Who am I kidding, I have no idea. It's not too boozy and I can wear it to work without smelling like I'm wearing \"go home cologne\".\n\nThis is my first soap from Storybook Soapworks and I'm happy this release introduced me to them. It worked into a nice thick and slick lather pretty easily. u/fahrenheit915 did a great job on this and u/La_Yerba_Mate killed it on the artwork.\n\nThe performance of the soap was good enough for me to complete my first 100% shavette shave. I'm really stoked about that. I had the Gem warming up in the Bullpen but ended up not needing it. I got one small cut on the round of my chin while chasing a better shave but I hope I've still done u/needsmorementhol proud.\n\nThis is also my first splash from Chatillion Lux. I love the menthol in there and it leaves my skin feeling refreshed. Of course u/hawns did a great job on this scent. The EdP will spray a ton if I'm not careful and it matches the set well. I've been a little obsessed with CL since I got Lemon Rose Chypre a while back and have been ordering batches of samples. I've got another batch waiting for me at the office today. I don't know why I didn't just get them all at once. Feel like less of a glut this way I guess.\n\nFinally, I'm super stoked to say that I was one of the winners of the custom brushes for the theme by u/phteven_j at Dogwood Handcrafts. I haven't seen the brush but based on his other work, I'm sure it will be fantastic.\n\nThanks to u/reguyw_nothingtolose for the whole shebang. I'm ready for Valley of Ashes.\n\nAnyway, have a great week. Back to the grind for me.\n\nTL;DR - Soap good. Splash good. EdP good. Brush yay!",

It does the job and seems to hydrate my beard better than a lot of the stuff out there. I don't like the tub it comes in so I moved it over to a wider tub that is more common these days (from an empty wholly kaw tub). C'mon proraso, its time to up your pkg to reflect modern times. The a/s is good stuff for me, scent does not linger which is great. At least, I can't smell it which is good. And the new maggards mild tech replacement head is good as well. For what it costs its just a good deal. This is definitely a low cost shave.",

Let's travel back in time to last Wednesday. That's the day before the Masters begin, and the opening day of the Stanley Cup Playoffs. My lowly CBJ who backed into the last playoff spot are about to play a team that tied the record for most wins in a single season.\n\nHere are a list of things that happened yesterday, and one that didn't, in descending likelihood of what I expected 5 days ago:\n\nTamba Bay Lightning take a 3-0 lead on the CBJ > Tiger wins the Masters > GoT season 8 premier is the most boring thing I watch all day >>>>>>>>> CBJ take a 3-0 lead on the lighting\n\nThat event that I thought most likely to happen was the one that didn't. Tiger did win the Masters. The GoT premier was fine but couldn't possibly live up to the hype that the marketing, buzz, and hiatus gave it; but more importantly, in comparison it was the lamest thing I watched all day. CBJ did take a 3-0 series lead on home ice, and after the game I actually watched GoT to calm down so I could sleep - and it worked.\n\n--\n\nSo Two Kings. Seemed fitting. GoT is about kings. In golf, Tiger and Jack are the two kings (even though Arnie is nicknamed The King) of the sport, and increasingly it's seeming like they are equally great, separated only by whichever arbitrary way you want to define greatness. They've both hit the absolute peaks of golf domination, done it for sustained periods, and are in a league of their own. Tiger has burned brighter and for a long time; Jack burned nearly as bright and for a longer time. The only thing I'm sure of is Tiger is the best golfer I've ever seen and the sport is just different when he competes. I'm certainly hoping he gets a few majors and keeps this going for a little while longer, because it will never be the same when he's done.",

When I read the scent notes on it:\n\n>This scent is inspired by Gratiot's trade and features tobacco, leather, rose, clove, nutmeg, sandalwood, vetiver, vanilla, musk, bergamot, and amber. This is the smell of a busy day in the Carondelet markets\n\nit seemed like it would be right in my lane. And I was right. This is a phenomenal leather/tobacco scent. Masculine but approachable.\n\nI dig it. A lot.\n\nHappy Monday squares.",

Love the handle on this Yaqi brush but the thing sheds like hell. The first few washes resulted in about 40 hairs coming off and then another 4 during this one lather last night. Not a good sign and it's too bad because the hair really does feel good.\n\nDecided to go with Stirling's Bergamot Lavender as a stronger scented soap to get the funk out of this new brush. Stirling is one of my favourites and it didn't disappoint again.\n\nSwitched out he Big Ben (after 2 shaves) to the Nacet and found it much better. Time will tell how it will hold up but still don't believe it's as good as the Astra for me. It's interesting that these blades are pretty popular so they shouldn't have too many issues... I'm starting to wonder if my technique is starting to take a dip.\n\nAlright, let's get this Monday started - I've been unable to login in to my work outlook account all morning... Great start!

Performance was soo good. Scent was too light.\n\n#### ❧ Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Gillette - Sheraton 1938 ::: Gillette - Nacet ‹136 uses›)*\n\nThis old broad is still giving comfy, close shaves. No reason to send her out to pasture yet.\n\nNo irritation.\n\n#### ❧ Soap Notes\n*^(Cooper & French - Fresh Start)*\n\nThis lather was superb, and the economy on this soap surpasses many others. I'm guessing I could use 1/8th of a tsp and get 3 passes where most soaps need 1/4 tsp. Makes me want to try more samples of theirs, to see if I can find one with a stronger scent.\n\n1/4 tsp soap loaded with a lightly-wet, high-backbone boar brush + 2.5 tsp water = 8 passes of perfect, creamy, slick, gorgeous lather. Obviously can reduce soap used!\n\nScent: citrus and woody was all I got. Nice, but so light.\n\nScent Strength: 2-3/10, almost imperceptible during shaving.\n\nBowl - I used the XL version of this bowl:\nhttps://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3392930\n\n#### ❧ Brush Notes\n*^(Stirling - Boar 24mm Factory Seconds‹12 uses›)*\n\nnot prickly, somewhat comfortable, but I wouldn't want to use this brush, at this stage of its break-in, if I was at risk of brush burn from an aggressive/harsh razor.\n\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Cut flush to where I just see the tips (above average for me)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm)\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

From the comments I received, people thought I may have put too little water in my lather, so I tried it again today. Loaded for 90 seconds, and added water straight from the faucet. I must have built the lather for about two minutes. Overall, the lather wasn't bad. It was slick, perhaps a bit too watery, but did a nice job. I think that my overall take away from this is that putting a lot of soap on your brush only makes building lather harder. It's not worth it. A 30 second load time is probably optimal.\n\nMaybe I'll try a 60 second one soon just to see what happens.",

Fourth day of generally inadequate shaves (hovering a little above or little below DFS level), The blade also appears to be losing its already limited mojo rapidly. The shaves are smooth enough, I like the design and asesthetics, but they really ought to sell this with their Level III plate as the base plate and then move up from there. The Medium (Level II) that comes with the handle is too mild for even my pretty moderate stubble that is shaved daily. Maybe with a third pass, I could move towards BBS, but 2 passes work to attain BBS with virtually every other SE and DE I own, and I don't love the Supply enough to keep it in the lineup as an exception.\n* **Soap**: One of my favorite Eufros scents, myrrh, cardamom, vanilla, and cloves. A lovely exotic scent and one of the best bases in wet shaving!.",

I definitely need to figure out how to use it - I thought I was going too mild and then I went too aggressive. My face feels like I shaved with sandpaper.\n\nOn the flip side, Vert Noir was a pleasant surprise. It has this dank, damp mushroomy green smell off the puck but it blooms into a nice green scent once its lathered. Going to give this one a few more tries.\n\nCheers!",

I got mine from Amazon. And like most people, the two blades I hated most were Derby and Merkur. And like 99% of the shavedom, I hated those - absolutely despised those. I thought they were dull, tuggy, not at all suitable for my perceived too tough and coarse beard. I settled on Feather and used them exclusively for a year or so.\n\nSince then, a lot of time passed. I found some favorite blade brands (Wizamet, Kai for example) and usually use those. I have also started using straight razors a lot. My technique has gone better. I have come to like a lot of things (scents mostly) that I didn't like at the beginning. A few weeks ago, I found a lonely Merkur blade (one in my hatelist), and got a wonderful shave with. I went onto using that blade for 11 more shaves - absolutely loved it. So this time, I went with this Chinese blade which, for whatever reason, was sitting in my blade box. Rockwell (4) always worked wonderfully for me, and the brush is one of my favorites. I was expecting to have to change the blade midway through my shave. But, as you can probably guess, I had a wonderful shave. I can easily call this shave one of the best ever. This blade feels like the opposite of a Feather blade. Back in the day, I would certainly mark it as tuggy and toss it. But it is so so smooth on skin. I absolutely felt like it was doing 0 damage to my skin - applied alum to confirm and yes - almost 0 burn. My shave was very close as well - in terms of closeness, I would say 95% BBS. In terms of straight razors, it felt a lot like a coticule edge - which is known to be very smooth but may not be the sharpest.\n\nI guess I will have to re-evaluate my stance on blade ymmv soon. But before doing that I have to visit some of my other hated blades (derby, voskhod, lab blue) etc.",

It was my first time with Monarch and out of the bottle this smelt much more powdery than when I put it on. When applied the smell is more floral and slightly sweet.\n\nThe shave itself was good, irritation free and no nicks. Relatively smooth for just a single pass too!",

It's been very evident switching between the two on a daily basis.\n\nParma Violet smells exactly like the sweets of the same name, which probably doesn't mean much for those outside the UK. It's an extremely sweet floral scent with notes of Rose, Jasmine and lily-of-the-valley. It's a fun occasional scent I think, not one I'll be rushing out to buy a full puck of.",

Great slickness and post shave! I took a break from the Macro method this morning. Started with a really damp, but not dripping brush then took my time face lathering while adding water when needed.\n\nThe scent is great as well. I picked up a light summery green. Not a blooming flowery spring green, but a deeper richer green. This is going to be a great summer soap.\n\nFirst time with Lord blades. I was impressed. Decent cutting with slightly more tugging than usual when my angle was off. By the end of the first pass, I had everything dialed in and we were gliding across what was left of my stubble with almost no feedback at all. Ended up with a 2 pass DFS with zero irritation.\n\nHappy Tuesday!",

Did a mix or ATG on my second XTG pass and made progress. One nick on the corner of my upper lip which is a trouble area for me. Oh!

Actually, I would put PP8 closer to Reserve than Excelsior for my personal preference. I just love that Reserve base.\n\nA busy week continues.",

I entered this castle to investigate and found a man that had been living for centuries there to defend some artifacts from ancient civilizations, each on various floors sealed away. I was told I could see but I couldn't attempt to open anything.\n\nOn one floor there was a family of werewolves, normal save for certain flashes of light or flickers would show a tail or an ear or a wolfs eye.\n\nOn another floor there was a man who I was told would someday break out to destroy the world. He was a pretty normal looking man from what I saw, in a thin hallway like an apartment. He had his own bedroom and he played video games on occasion. He knew I was watching and he blew me a kiss. He had black hair that had the iridescent of a raven or a crow.\n\nOn a third floor there was a sort of sandy substance. My guide told me that these were used once to befall sleep. I asked if the sandman was real, and the guide said that maybe once but no one will be picking these up if he could help it.\n\nI think we were beginning to traverse up to the top spire when I started to wake up. He squeezes my shoulder and asked me if there would some day be a way to transcribe a dream in its wholeness. I told him I didn't know, and I was afraid of what people would be when they'd be able to accomplish it. He let me go.",

I figured it would suck and it did.\n\n#### ❧ Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Gillette - Sheraton 1938 ::: Gillette - Nacet ‹137 uses›)*\n\nMore tugging than usual on first few strokes. I think the knot just didn't lay down a good enough layer of soap. Maybe Icarus has to be thicker on my face when I use such an old blade. But I added more lather and it was better.\n\nNo irritation.\n\n#### ❧ Soap Notes\n*^(Declaration Grooming - Icarus Darkfall)*\n\nLove this scent!\n\n40 second load with lightly-wet synthetic brush + 2 tsp water = 4 passes of slick, creamy lather.\n\nScent: burned wood, leaves, dankness. I'm a big fan.\n\nScent Strength: 5/10, enjoyably present during shaving.\n\nBowl - I used the XL version of this bowl:\nhttps://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3392930\n\n#### ❧ Brush Notes\n*^(Wild West Brushworks - Boss Synth Black & Jade‹1 uses›)*\n\nThis Boss knot sucks so hard. Soft tips, as with so many synths, but stiffness in the bristles just shoved me around so much that if I had to use it as my only brush, I'd probably switch to shaving every few days instead.\n\nI realize many people like synthetics, and that's okay. They do have good attributes. I know I'm not in the majority. But this is how I see it.\n\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: A little irritating\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Cut flush to where I just see the tips (above average for me)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm)\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

I killed a tub of this off in Glissant and had a half bottle of splash. But because the wife hating it the bottle got sent away. I didn't realize how much I loved the scent, and how much I missed it until Will announced it was getting rereleased. I'm not a fan of WCS, so I passed on the new version and figured I could do without. Saw this set come up on the Bazaar and jumped on it. Glad that I did.\n\nHave a nice Tuesday everyone!",

Still OK. It neither made me go \"ow\" or \"wow.\"\n\nStill not totally sold on this brush. Really lovely texture when I hand lather, but a bit more scritchy than I like when I face lather. Very very dense. Bit of a lather hog. The crazy amount of bloom makes it awkward to paint with. I think it's just not really my thing.\n\nAgain with the Noirs. After several uses, I think the best way to describe Stirling Noir is that it's the essence of Drakkar Noir mid-drydown but with different green notes and *way* less lemon. Not an exact match by any means, but a very nice complimentary scent. I'm even tempted to try the Stirling Noir EdT if I can get my hands on a sample, despite already owning the real thing and one of its popular clones.",

I typically lean towards alcohol aftershaves but I'm very impressed by CL's toner formula the more I use it.\n\nThanks to all the artisans for making West Egg happen!",

The attention to detail on this piece is fantastic. From the rustic looking (wax?) coin that says \"Thanks,\" to the magnetic box closure and hand written thank you note, you couldn't really ask for more presentation wise. As for the brush itself, it is absolutely magnificent. This shade of pink really pops in person, and the handle itself is very comfortable to hold. The coin on the bottom is very cool looking, and reminiscent of no other logo I've seen on the market. The knot isn't the lauded \"gel tipped\" option that many with a Leonidam brush have raved about, but there is nothing \"standard\" about this standard two band option. It is incredibly dense and soft, while providing a mild scrub and good amount of backbone, and one of the best knots I've used to date. Overall, the entire package was immaculate, and I have no qualms recommending Davide's brushes to anyone. Don't let the price tag steer you away.\n\nAs for the rest of the shave, I think I over-watered the M&M sample, but is still preformed well. Great slickness both primary and residual, and felt no tightness on the post shave. The last couple of shaves with the OC have not been very smooth, so I wonder if I've reached the end with this blade. Will have to pop in something else tomorrow and find out.\n\nSpring break is almost here. Happy Tuesday!",

I expected an annoying shave.\n* Surprise! The other blades I had used in the M1 (Personna Blue, Gillette 7:00 Yellow, Astra SP) only *seemed* to be sharp. The Polisilver IS sharp, and the combo made for a very quick (12 minute) BBS two pass shave. I am impressed as to how much better the M1 shaves with a really good blade in it. (Though also depressed that the capricious Slavic overlords of the Polisilver brand have now made it less and less available / affordable to we running dogs of imperialism in the West.)\n* The light maneuverable Calypso is a joy to shave with; I've come to appreciate light razors more and more after spending years as a heavy metal man. I still appreciate a 105g chunk of metal, but the Calypso \"dance\" around the face is quick and non-fatiguing, a great work day shaver.\n* **Soap**: M&M base is growing on me - very good technical performance today, in the realm of the top tier. The scent is only OK though, attempting vetiver as parchment but only partially succeeding. Someone took a safer course and put a few \"cologney\" scents in the mix, making Kells more accessible but less \"ancient\" / unusual, so it ends up as a pleasant though forgettable scent. Still, getting a strong base right in the early days of a brand's life is not insignificant, as the scents can always be worked with later or even outsourced altogether if one is not Mr. Perfume Genius.\n* **Frag:** Another obscure work of genius from Lauder. Includes a bay rum accord but then another 25 notes or so, so the bay notes are but a small part of the mosaic. This is a boozy tropical delight full of charm, complexity, and sophistication. The opening is chaotic and challenging, but in ten minutes, you are in upscale tropical heaven. Like all Lauders, this is a great bargain, but also uses the kinda cheap Lauder entry level atomizers, so many false start squirts, especially if it's been sitting for a bit. Worth a try, especially if you like bay rums but want to smell a tad more civilized.",

Tons of green top notes with a powdery fougere underneath. This is my second APR set and I'm loving the way Dan's multi-layered compositions unfold. Unfortunately for my bank account, I'm interested in picking up more of these fantastic offerings. They aren't cheap! While this F1 soap is a decent performer, there is a pretty big gap between this and the newer base. I think F2 is a massive improvement in slickness and protection. APR is all about the scents though when it comes down to it. Who knew u/JohnB413 was on to something?",

I'm not a fan of the scent, so I'm glad I've got a sample of this instead of a full tub.\n\nMusic for a While is a wonderful frag.

I get better results bowl-lathering w/ creams, and I like how they are more viscous. When I re-apply for 2nd and 3rd pass, it feels like the cream is really sticking to my face and providing a good cushion. Stubble Buster splashes really outperform their price point. I don't have any experience w/ the colognes most of them are based on, but to my nose the scent on Absolutely is very similar to B&M Reserve Classic.",

WTG, XTG/ATG, and clean up. I'm slowly getting better at using the Tech and the result has been improving. Everything else is a pleasure to use.\n\n**The Soap** worked well. I had a near perfect lather yesterday, using the Stirling boar brush. For today, it was almost perfect but towards the end, the lather was thinning out a bit. I think I shook out too much water today so next time, I'll retain a bit more water. The scent is getting better and now I just recognize the clean smell.\n\n**The Razor and Blade** combination was good. I was surprised that the blade is still holding up pretty well. I thought that it would drag and be dull by now but it isn't showing signs of uses. It cuts well and I had zero irritation by the end. For the razor, I really need to watch out for the angle because it has a small margin of sweetspot. Challenging mild razor but still a pleasure to use.\n\n**The Brush** worked well. It is one of the softest brush that I own. The big knot just brushes against my face like a soft bundle of hair. Lathers up great and holds it pretty well. I do get some lather flying because of the large knot but it is still one of my favorite regardless. It also uses up quite a bit of soap but I got plenty to use.\n\n**The aftershave portion** was nice and chilly. The Stirling MITA WH felt so great on my face. I'm loving the menthol during my aftershave portion. I'm using menthol almost everyday and I love that minute of chill. The Nivea balm works well as always.\n\nOverall, a great shave. Soap and brush worked up a great lather. Though a bit thinner at the end, it did its job. Razor and blade is a mild combination but with the right angle, it cuts efficiently. No irritation and almost BBS shave. Left with a clean face and ready for another shave in the days to come!",

Thanks to u/MadDingersYo\nfor suggesting SW / enabling me! I decided to start out with Pomona as it seemed like one of the more straightforward scents, and I love the smell of apples.\n\nIt's softer than most soaps I've tried - it feels like it's verging on a croap. The softness made it very easy to load the sample, which was a bonus. The performance did not disappoint, it produced a stellar lather. The scent for me is autumnal - apples and mulled wine. Nice if a little boozy.\n\nI'm looking forwards to working my way through the rest of the SW samples. Early standouts for me based on an initial smell are probably Necromantik and Tres Matres. Autumn Ash is the only one that I really didint like based on first impressions although my wife may veto Alchemist.",

Between my family flying back from Houston, work and trying to catch up on some side projects I've been busy. Thankfully things are settling back into a routine and I'm able to catch up on things.\n\nI've had some great shaves over the last few days including some Pure Lavender and Sweet Lemon. I've really been feeling scents that focus on one or two notes and then really excite them well and that brings me to today's shave.\n\nToday I used some Noble Otter Flying Hide. I like NO soap and I've made no bones about it. As a fellow Houstonian I like to see a Texan small business succeed. That said, the V2 soap base as well and the scents are really fantastic. Flying Hide smells like you just walked into a western wear store. It's a scent that is to me, instantly recognizable. The leather is rich off the puck and there's a warmness to it. It's far less sweet then Mammoths Almond Leather. You could say that it's a one dimensional scent, but that belies how deep and well executed it is. Lather is top tier. It's not too thirsty, can take plenty of water and the slickness while not quite to the level of B&M Reserve is still excellent. Post shave feel is too notch.\n\nPost shave I went with the matching AS. Again with the same warm, fresh leather. It's masculine but not overly so. I think this AS could work very well with a soap like Chiseled Face Ghost Town Barber.\n\nIn other news I managed to score a puck of Flowers in the Dark. I'm pretty excited. As y'all know I love a lavender and it's a very unique take on lavender with the Lav, cedar and ozone. I'm planning to do a Day of the Dead photo. We will see how it comes out. I have a big sugar skull from when my wife and I went to Cabo. I'm going to try to incorporate it somehow.\n\nFinally, my birthday is coming up in less than a week. I'm thinking about buying another set of APR since I loved Fenchurch so much and I would love any recommendations you might have.\n\nHave a good Wednesday!\nRobot",

Lisa's is another soap that shines in the post shave. Soft, silky skin for hours. No weepers, but I had to go over a few spots more than usual. I think this tuck of GSB's is not up to par.",

I can't tell if I over watered or under soaped. I think under loaded. Brush was a bit wetter than normal when I loaded.\n\nStill working on my chin. I think it's getting to where I am holding the skin down better. Feels like there's a ton of elasticity there and so it's easy for the blade to snag and pull. I've also got some massively thick (not dense) whiskers there.\n\nTried Lonestar today and am loving it. The leather note is making me feel a bit like Roland Deschain which is awesome. Would love to see someone do a Dark Tower series of scents :)",

Bear with me.\n\n\n*The Shave:* Really digging this [scuttle.](https://imgur.com/a/7RqvMep) And this brush. And etc. Between my time with the straight razor and now shaving my head, I've spent a lot of extra time this year shaving. These opportunities to shave only my face are becoming fewer and fewer. And it barely takes any time at all, comparatively.\n\n\nThanks to u/MadDingersYo for the Summer Break samples. Tried *Field Day* first to see if I liked the scent better when lathered. Sort of, but not really. It's definitely a spring scent, but it's not objectively pleasant. I foresee myself being in the mood for it sometimes, though.\n\nThe performance was great, though. I keep it pretty safe with my soap choices, and everytime I branch out I'm surprised. And I hesitate to say, \"I'm surprised,\" because it sounds like my expectations are low. There are definitely plenty of great soaps out there. Here's another. Can't wait to try *Bell Ringer* tomorrow.\n\n\n*The Song:* Pretty and laid back. Score.",

It is a huge sample that Vida was passing out at last year's Maggard Meet. It's a pretty good soap. I mean, it's a lot better than I remembered it being. It lathered easily, makes a really slick and stable lather and doesn't dry my skin out as much as some other soaps. All around a good soap to use.\n\nSynthetic brushes are objectively the best value going for brushes. But I still prefer natural bristle/hair brushes way more. Synthetics make a hell of a good lather effectively and efficiently, but they feel...funny. I will always have them around, but my natural brushes will definitely get the lion's share of my attention.",

SOTD\n\n* **Razor** \\- Maggard MR5 w/ V3\n* **Blade** \\- Rapira Swedish Supersteel (2)\n* **Brush** \\- Maggard 24mm Synth\n* **Soap** \\- Wholly Kaw - Fern Concerto Menth\n* **Post** \\- Wholly Kaw - Fern Concerto Splash\n\nMorning, playboys. So, for those that aren't aware, my insanely fantastic guessing skills had won me 2nd place in the NCAA Tourney Bracket Poll this year, and I was given the chance to pick from 5 fantastic prizes! Of all the generous artisans that donated to the contest, the only one I for some reason haven't tried yet was Wholly Kaw, so it was a no brainer. I'm terrible at understanding, or should I say recognizing many scents, so it was sort of difficult for me to pick a scent. Went with Fern Concerto. First impression? Smells really good, but I have no idea wtf I'm smelling. Maybe some sort of slightly lemony, frosty, green stuff? I dunno, but it's legit. The shave itself, well, again, i've never used a Wholly Kaw soap so I was worried about flooding it out, and as such used a pretty dry brush. When I first started trying to build a lather on my face, it was super dry and pasty, and after adding water a few times, I started to get that almost stringy thing going on. We were getting somewhere. After adding water a few more times, a horrible pun came to me, and I said \"holy cow.\" This shit is good. It was one of the thickest, most dense lathers I've had, but super slick. I'm not a review guy, so all I can really say is, I was impressed. Big time. I want to once again thank /u/Spankmeister88 for setting everything up and especially /u/whollykaw for the generosity and fantastic products!",

I didn't go to the game because I told myself it's only a series and if we're to do anything, we'll be there in the finals playing for the cup and I'll try to go then. Now I actually regret not making the trip because while it was *only* a series, it was still history and I wasn't there to witness it. I can't imagine the energy in that building but I could tell what it meant to them and the players from my couch. Earlier this year, one of our studio broadcasters announced his retirement after this season. When they cut to the broadcasters post game, he got choked up in the lead in. That's what this means to this team and those that support it. We all know it was only one series, but we also know what it took to get it. It's never been our goal, but it's a major accomplishment nonetheless and I couldn't be happier. Now to sit home and rest/recover from the enormous effort it took to beat this team, while we watch the Leafs and Bruins beat the piss out of each other. If anyone wants to jump on this bandwagon, I welcome you.\n\nEdit: Pens got swept too hahahahahaha",

TTS recommendation kept suggesting it so I decided to give it a go. Wow. Once this thing lathers, it smells amazing! The 'spicy' notes that I get off the puck mellow out nicely and the citrus comes through more. It smells fantastic! I spent a good amount of time working the lather on my face, even though it [lathers easily](https://i.imgur.com/3MK4TOh.jpg). Performance wise, it was okay - I felt the blade more that I have in a long time so I guess less cushion? The post-shave wasn't drying so that was good.\n\nSecond use of this badger brush and it is fantastic. Lathers easily and feels luxurious when lathering. Seems to have softened up already compared to the first go so break-in time is definitely better than boar.\n\nThe Nacet blade gave me a few nicks this time. I didn't have an issue the first time but was surprised that it kept catching my skin! Got a couple of nicks at my nose and lower lip. Also some razor burn on my neck, which I didn't have the first time. So it's either the lather or I can't do very sharp blades at R4 - until they dull up a bit. Next shave will tell.\n\nAlready Wed! Fantastic during short work-weeks. And a Raptors win last night. Sun is shining and going up to 10C today.. Gotta love it.\n\nHave a good one folks!",

Smooth comfy shave that gives me about 7 to 8 hrs BBS. I can do a bit better in terms of duration of BBS with other razors, but given the mild blade feel and smooth shave of the M1, few can give this result with so little fuss and muss.\n* Soap: Another great technical performer and scent from GD -- the packaging lacks a label so I am guessing as to name, and part of the \"fun\" of GD is that one may never be able to buy this specific scent in this particular base ever again.\n* Frag: A great all season scent, a floral fougere balanced carefully between aromatic and sweet.",

Very good shave.\n\nNo tugging or irritation.\n\n#### ❧ Soap Notes\n*^(Declaration Grooming - Icarus Darkfall)*\n\nLove this scent! But with this brush, a 30 second load is great for most soaps. However, Icarus is different.\n\n40 second load with lightly-wet boar brush + 2.5 tsp water = 3 passes of slick, wet-ish lather. I think I need to up this soap load time by 10 more seconds, or maybe try blooming it, like some have mentioned.\n\nScent: burned wood, leaves, dankness. I'm a big fan.\n\nScent Strength: 5/10, enjoyably present during shaving.\n\nBowl - I used the XL version of this bowl:\nhttps://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3392930\n\n#### ❧ Brush Notes\n*^(Semogue - 1800 Boar‹11 uses›)*\n\ncomfy enough brush. nice splay by now. Still young, though.\n\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Cut flush to where I just see the tips (above average for me)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm)\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

To my nose, the soap had a very sweet white grape scent with some champagne sparkle (though not as nose-ticklingly fizzy as Delor de Treget). The EdP is, as expected, fuller and richer. I suppose we'll see how it develops through the day.\n\nLeaving work early today because the smallest human has a Spanish recital.

I think I seem to be an anomaly in that I find the safety bar smoother than the open comb. Makes this blade feel a lot less harsh, even with the larger blade gap.\n\nThe scent on Tres Matres is a definite winner for me. Never thought any other scent in the SW line would be able to hold a candle to my first love Necromantic, but this one is certainly a contender. This base is not just great for a vegan soap, it's great period.\n\nHappy hump day! 🐪🐫",

I know that's not a real thing. This is the remnants of my Babershop and Baker St. samples that were both too low to use easily. I've hear of people scrapping the soap back into the middle of the container once the ring of death gets too bad so I just mashed these two together as best I could. Babershop scent and color dominate even though they were roughly equal parts.\n\nShave was pretty good. I got a little irritation on the left side of my neck, but I also think I went a little too ATG with my normal north to south second pass which is really supposed to be more XTG.\n\nLastly, DO NOT WIPE YOUR BLADES. Small sample size so far, but I've been doing a quick \"strop\" of the edge of my blade when drying off my razor forever. Like since before I switched to DE. I'm now wondering if I was causing my own issue even with cartridges as I started wiping those dry to increase the blade life sometime ago. This may very well be damaging the blade edge. Normally I cannot get more than 2 comfortable shaves out of a blade. Granted this was only the 3rd shave on this blade and it's the only one I've tried it with so far, but seems to be a thing. To satisfy my OCD of drying the razor off, I just give it a good shake and then a quick swipe of the top cap length-wise ensuring that I'm not making contact with the blade at all.",

WTG, XTG/ATG + Clean up. Not a BBS but felt clean afterwards. Still a bit of stubble left on the neck but you can't really see it unless you zoom in hard. Couple in grown hairs from yesterday but nothing major.\n\n**The Soap** worked well. It's been a while since I used What the Puck. It smells decent and the puck is very hard as it's triple-milled. It lathered up fine and performed well. Slick and creamy lather that protected my face. Another all around good soap. The post shave is not great so it neither moisturizes or dries out the skin.\n\n**The Razor and Blade** combination was good. The blade is still holding up pretty well. A mild shave that I was almost carefree with. It seems like I cannot cut my face with this razor. I'm beginning to shave without thinking. I'll probably change to the Fatip piccolo and that should help me pay attention more to the shave.\n\n**The Brush** worked well. The scrubbiest out of my boars but still performed well. I loaded the soap with a bit more water and loaded for a bit more as well. The result was an excellent lather that lasted throughout the shave. I was pleased with the brush today.\n\n**The aftershave portion** was nice and chilly. The Witch Hazel tones the skin while the Ice Cold balm chills the skin. Great combinatinon.\n\nOverall, a great shave. Nothing to complain about other than my skin breaking out a bit. I can't blame the shave because it's probably my diet or me touching my beard a bit too much. Regardless, I'm slowly pulling away from the Miami Mojito soap and going back to the variety. It was way too boring just shaving with one soap for weeks.",

It was between two different products, either Declarations Fourth and Pine or B&Ms Roam. I love the stylised Bison on the Declaration / Chatillon Lux soaps but for some reason I love the Roam artwork more. It just fits to tell a story and perfectly describe the product.\n\nThe shave itself was great, the first time I'd used the Karve, which my wife dubbed the Liberace of razors due to the brass colour. The razor worked great once I found the angle, smooth shave and DFS with only a single pass. When I have more time I'm excited to try more passes\n\nFirst time using the Roam splash too and it's not what I expected having used the soap. Much more dried tobacco than I get in the soap. The soap took a while to grow on me so hopefully the splash will do the same.",

I don't own that many full-sized tubs, but of those I have Imperial Rum has my favourite label art. Who doesn't love an octopus with attitude?\n\nThis is the first Mühle blade I've tried and it seems... bad? It feels a lot less sharp than anything else I've used recently. Possibly it's just a duff blade or it will improve tomorrow. Time will tell.\n\nHave a great Thursday all!",

I picked up Fern Concerto from the Bazaar last week and my first with off the puck had me wishing it was time for a shave. At first sniff, I'm greeted with a bright Citrus scent with hints of something deeper beneath the surface. Once I lathered it, the citrus stayed strong and something that I couldn't quite pick out kept teasing me from behind the citrus.\n\nThe menthol in this soap is great. A slow build and nice and cold. Nothing uncomfortable, but very noticeable.\n\nThe shave performance and post-shave, like all other Wholly Kaw soaps, is top-notch. Easily one of my favorite soap base to shave with.\n\nHappy Thursday!",

Rather than a finger scoop like last time, I went all-in and loaded directly off the puck. I think I started too wet or didn't load enough (100 swirls), I was flinging watery lather everywhere. I loaded an additional 40 swirls and then it felt too thick. I added more water... I think you see where this is going. It turned out quite slick, but as I was rinsing I could tell that it still was thick, so I'll need some more days to dial that in. Afterwards, I smell nice.

I was so pumped to see this one selected. Not only did I use the soap with my favorite label artwork, I decided to max out the cuteness with every piece of the shave (except for aftershave because I have no cute aftershaves) and I even took a photo, which I rarely do.\n\nThe Moka Express is one of the prettiest commercial / non-artisan brushes on the market, imo. The knot features plenty of natural-looking color variation and the handle is beautiful. It's paired with a 4.5\" porcelain rice bowl purchased for $3 from my local Chinese grocer. Cella has some of the cutest packaging around, right from Italian Santa Claus on the box to the typeface they use for the logo to the glossy red soap tub (not pictured). The soap itself is very pretty too with an almost pearly sheen to it. My 1955 Tech has the cute old Gillette logo etched into the nickel-plated brass head and it's in almost perfect condition, making it much more photogenic than my Super Speed. Lord Classic has the best \"retro\" vibe of any blade packaging in my collection... I love those colors. And finally, the SpongeBob Squarepants EdT has one of the greatest bottles I've ever seen in the fragrance world. It just makes me sad that it doesn't smell like Cool Water or pineapple, which would have been the perfect scent for the theme... so in SpongeBob's honor, I shall wear an Aventus dupe instead.",

The weight of the razor made cutting through my stubble so easy and I barely had to apply any pressure. I'm still not to the point where chasing BBS is worth it for me but once I'm more comfortable with the razor i may give it a go to see if i get any irritation. The general consensus seemed to be start on the 3 or 4 plate and go from there. I may jump it up to 4 next time around but 3 still provided an excellent shave with a couple passes + cleanup on my chin/neck.\n\nWent with the Personna blade I used in my DE89 last time for comparison sake and I'm really enjoying this blade. Gonna be going back through my sample pack with my next 6-12 shaves to settle on one for buying in bulk.\n\nI don't need to say much about the soap, you all know how great it is. Good start to my Thursday.",

B&M labeling is excellent in general, and this one is among their best. I also love the variously costumed otters on Noble Otter!\n* **Razor / Blade**: Another flawless 2 pass BBS from this excellent combo. The utter lack of even minor nicks and / or irritation as well as the smoothness of the shave offsets the relatively short (7 hr) BBS feel.\n* **Frag**: AS feels a tad overly heavy and sweet on this relatively warm Spring day. May be time to retire this great scent till it gets chilly again.",

I'm more concerned with the product inside. That being said, it can be a nice bonus if you're into taking SOTD pics and whatnot and I definitely appreciate a good design as that's what I do for a living. I don't own many soaps that I would say have a \"really cool looking label\" aside from BaM Tuesday. It's a simple geometric design, but I really like it. Love the soap too. I don't get when people say Glissant is lacking in any kind of performance metric. I don't really think it needed to be \"upgraded\", but I do realize this is all a matter of personal preference. Regarding the fragrance, I used to hate this when I first got the sample vial, but I've worn it a few more times since and it's growing on me. I can dig it now. Happy almost Friday all!",

      "body": "[18th of April, 2019 \"West Egg\"](https://i.imgur.com/OW8qCSI.jpg)\n\n- Razor: Gillette Aristocrat\n- Blade: Astra\n- Soap: CL/Storybook \"West Egg\"\n- Brush: That Darn Rob \"Pueblo\" w/SHD\n- Aftershave: Pinault Clubman\n\nToday's theme was a Shave Photos with the soap that has your favorite label artwork. I know \"West Egg\" is the new hotness, but the fine detail really encapsulates the 1920s Art Deco styling that you would expect from the height of Gatsby. I've said it many, many times but I really appreciate good label design and the golden black with subdued lines and a mandala-esq pattern is really fantastic.\n\nI only own one other Storybook Soap, [\"Coffee Spoons\"](https://i.imgur.com/1YiF6J6.jpg) and I thoroughly enjoy it. I found the soap base to be medium soft, I bloomed it with hot water for 30 seconds and used a well soaked Maggard's SHD badger. The lather was medium intensity and had excellent slickness. The scent is, interesting and until now I've never felt the need to smell champagne. From the soap I get a effervescence, a soapy tone and a hint of some grape that is subdued. I think the scent is unisex in nature add runs very much towards the cleaner spectrum. It would not be inappropriate for a workplace.\n\nI did not have the matching aftershave or cologne. Anecdotically, I've heard the aftershave is a mirror scent, while the cologne is a light, green fougere. With that in mind, I chose to use some clubman, because I felt it best fit the nature of soap.\n\nIn other news, you might've noticed that I've been shaving a lot with a Aristocrat. Thus far I've really enjoyed using it, but what is even cooler is that it's a loaner from someone active in the wetshaving community that volunteered it, after noticing I didn't have a lot of golden razors. I've been on some of the other wet shaving sites. There's a lot of toxicity there, and free-speech is not encouraged. It's really a shame and I don't know if I had started on one of those sites as opposed to /r/WetShaving I would be nearly as active. I guess what I'm trying to say is, I'm grateful to this community and all the wonderful people I've interacted with.\n\nFinally, I posted on the /r/Shave_Bazaar that I am currently looking for a Declaration Grooming Unicorn Ivory Theo or Jefferson in anything but a B3. Recognizing that it is not the easiest brush to get ahold of, I am offering to trade my unused Fougere Gothique Coffet #34 + Cash for it. If you happen to know somebody that is interested/willing to sell a unicorn ivory please let me know!\n\nThanks and have a lovely day!\n\nRobot",

As far as label is concerned I have several favorites. Behold the Whatsis, Baudelaire, BlackBerry Blossom Bay, Kyoto, Sicily. But West Egg won. Simoly for scent alone.\n\n\nI love the scent on this set. Best purchase of a 2019 so far, and I'm excited to see what City of Ash will be like.",

It's been a bit of a tough week with our 6m old daughter getting sick and then myself and my wife also coming down with it. I didn't want anything too challenging or overwhelming scent-wise as I'm still feeling rather fragile. Enter Tres Matres.\n\nSW describes Tres Matres as a clean, floral petrichor and they nailed it. There's a lot of petrichor / freshly cut grass here, particularly once you start lathering it, which to me makes it lovely spring scent. But there's also those subtle floral notes to keep it more interesting. It also pairs quite nicely with Cade (although I say that about quite a few things because Cade, at least as an AS, is pretty subtle).\n\nPerformance was great once again. It loads and lathers really easily, and the lather it produces is great. For me it performs just as well as Castle Forbes, except that it costs half the price.\n\nThe Mühle blade seems to have settled down a bit thank goodness. On the other hand it wasnt the closest shave I've had recently which is maybe due to the blade being not the sharpest.\n\nHave a great Friday all, and UK folks enjoy the Easter Bank Holiday!",

Astoundingly easy to lather and such a great shave and post shave. The scent is among my favorites and introduced me to floral oriental scents. The description is succinct but leaves no mystery - spice, rose, and woodsy amber.\n\nI was inspired by a post I saw recently about someone taking a blade to 100 shaves. I tried with my Polsilver Super Iridium but I only made it 13 shaves. I've had a lot of irritation and tug the last few shaves and was glad to go back to a fresh blade I know inside and out. My technique and blade care has a ways to go before I can put one through a marathon.\n\nQuality shave. Super close with enough residual slickness to clean up with no fear of irritation.

Light, green and fresh. I feel like Sharp Dressed Man (AKA Creed Green Irish Tweed) does an excellent job of balancing the line between fragrance and fougere.\n\nHuh, as I type this I wonder, can't it be both? A fougere is an idealized version of what fern would smell like and since fern doesn't smell like anything a fougere is a bit open ended. Regardless the original fragrance was first released by Creed in 1985. Top notes include Lemon and Verbena. Heart notes are Iris and Violet leaf. Base notes are Mysore sandalwood and Ambergris.\n\nI legitimately love this scent. It's not something I reach for every day but it feels to me like the older and more mature brother to Executive Man. For me, this is a soap I like to wear going out. It's classy, clean and gives an underspoken confidence.\n\nThe soap is the Stirling base. I don't love it in the same way I love Icarus, but it remains an exceptional value while providing a good shave. The lather is medium thin and moderately slick. Post shave I used the matching AS.\n\nIn other news; I bought s set of APR Fougere Trois last night. Everyone I talk to has said good things about it. I already have Fenchurch (an amazing tobacco and leather scent) and was looking for something else to add in from APR. I was also considering Ozymandias but seeing as how Trois is a limited edition, I wanted to get one before they ran out.\n\nHave a good Friday Y'all!\n\nRobot",

I have just driven through the night (thanks, dollar tree version of 5-hour energy!) and I just had a I-don't-give-a-crap-what-happens-lets-get-messy-and-just-not-care kind of shave. Tried Isidro (does it mean \"unscented\" in whatever language it is in? :-/\n\nI don't know whether to go to bed, and miss the first half of the work day, or just push through and be exhausted all day.\n\n#### ❧ Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Gillette - Sheraton 1938 ::: Gillette - Nacet ‹139 uses›)*\n\nThis aging blade does not like 2 days of growth, and I think I just put it through 2.5 days... my mind is not together enough to figure it out right now. So the first pass was tuggy, but not as bad as I thought it would be. The rest was comfy, fast, and enjoyable. Got a great cut for number 139.\n\n#### ❧ Soap Notes\n*^(Oleo - Isidro)*\n\nThem: Like Tom Ford. \"Citrus, Ginger, Tobacco, Amber, Neroli, Peppercorn, Cedar, Patchouli, Oakmoss, Vetiver\"\n\nI decided, after such a tiring night of driving, that I would kinda try a Marco-thing, and load a really wet brush lightly on the puck for a while, until I saw the airy froth give way to thick lather. And then just face lather and just not care. I may repeat it on occasion, if I feel the way I did this morning. But I didn't really like it as much as my normal routine. I don't like stuff flying off the brush. And I didn't like using so much product (maybe 3-4x as much as usual, I'm guessing). But ... I wanted a messy, careleyss shave, and that's what I got. So... win. And it was fun to try something different.\n\nAlso, one down-side of loading more soap than you really need, is that my face feels more dry, by far, than it usually does. Was worth this shave just to learn this.\n\nminute or two load with highly-wet long-bristled boar brush + 1/2-ish tsp water = Who Knows passes of too-rich nigh-scentless lather.\n\nScent: Supposed to be several notes, but all I picked up was a super faint woody one.\n\nScent Strength: 1/10, almost imperceptibly present during shaving. This may be one of the weakest soaps I've ever tried.\n\nBowl - I used the XL version of this bowl:\nhttps://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3392930\n\n#### ❧ Brush Notes\n*^(Omega - 10098 Boar‹12 uses›)*\n\nThis guy was actually comfy today. I don't know whether it was the 18 hour inadvertent soak, or the soap load that was 3-4 times richer than usual.... but it was enjoyable to use, and feel. I'll do a normal lather next time and see what it feels like.\n\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Few hairs are showing some tip length (with most being cut flush)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm)\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

Seriously amazing feel both during and after the shave. Zero tightness or pulling or anything whatsoever. Scent-wise, I picked up on the beer in the soap fairly heavily while lathering but it dissolved into an unnamable melange of scents while actually shaving. When I say that I couldn't name the parts, I don't mean that as a complaint at all! It was wonderfully blended and fragranced in a way that was totally enjoyable! With the aftershave, all I really smelled was the caramel popcorn and damp grass, but that's not a bad thing either! Keeping in the theme, I finished off with Zoologist's Rhino to symbolize a baseball glove. I think it tied everything together quite well. Happy Friday!",

Super slick and easy to get just right. Right up there with WK in my mind.\n\nThe scent: I'm not sure about this one. I normally turn away from anything powdery, it's just not my thing. Powder was also the first thing that my nose picked up with this soap. I know there is more there, but the powder stays in the forefront and, at least for my nose, hides most of the other scents. It's not unpleasant and I get hints of spice and sweetness behind the powder.\n\nThe AS: It holds less of the powdery scent I picked up in the soap. It is a darker scent to me. I get more of the spices than the sweet here. Not an exact match to the soap for my nose, but a very good companion to brings new smells forward.\n\nThe tune: needed something light and groovy. Decent beat and kinda jazzy.\n\nOverall: Decent 2 pass DFS with a few weepers on my neck due to sloppy technique.",

I can't decide if it smells like rum and coke or Kraken Black, but it's #2 for me now on fav bayrums (DCCS is still #1). My only complaint was I put way too much soap in the bowl and ended up with enough lather for 2 shaves....will use the rest tomorrow I guess as I left what was left of the 2 chunks I put in in the bowl.",

I recently picked up the GC .84 and have been enjoying it. It seems to give smooth, effortless, and efficient shaves. If you're on the fence or one pops up on a BST, I'd definitely recommend trying to grab it.\n\nRegarding the Maggard SHD knot, I know a lot has already been said but I'll echo everyone else by saying this thing is great! Super soft gel tips and just the right amount backbone for me. I set it in a ~ 16mm deep socket and couldn't be happier.",

Big shame because I loved the smell of it. Even on shave #30, my ATT SE1 with a Feather took out a week's worth of growth like nothing. Of course, I had to break out my favorite NO set for this shave since I know it works well with my skin. Have a great Saturday, folks! Stay safe out there.",

In the end I chose Wickham's Scottish Heather. Sadly it was a bit of a disappointment. Not in terms of performance, or in scent off the puck, but because the scent pretty much disappeared when I lathered it.\n\nIt's a shame because the scent off the puck is lovely. It really evokes an old holiday where I hiked across Scotland. You can smell the Scottish moorland. I guess the plus side is the soap's smell is so subtle you can go with pretty much any AS without clashing.\n\nHave a great weekend all!",

It balances the floral and the tea perfectly. I pick up a black tea and honey scent from the puck. Lathered, the tea scent pairs with a floral sweetness that is really relaxing. Shave wise, it's B&M, so no worries there.\n\nThe brush whipped up a great lather in no time. It definitely feels bigger than my 24mm tuxedo, but that doesn't effect how well it spreads the lather on my face. In the end, I had to make a few minor adjustments in my technique, but it didn't swallow up my face.\n\nGood shaves and a good day!",

The only mind-altering substances I consume are sugar, caffiene, and [magic brain-pills](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citalopram) from [my doctor](https://i.imgur.com/oTNGnAm.png), but the date is 4/20 and it reminds me of a dude I used to know. When I worked in a music store, one of our customers was a cool old weed-smokin' funk-lovin' iron-pumpin' black dude who always brought his guitars to me for service... he looked like he could have been a member of Rick James' band in the '80s the way he presented himself to the world. Anyway, my workshop was at the back of the building and he wore so much rosemary & patchouli oil that I would *literally smell him coming to my shop before I could or hear him in the store.* Really nice guy but daaaaamn did he ever wear a lot of hippy shit to cover up his weed stank.\n\nAnyway, when I first saw the scent notes for Seville I assumed it was going to smell exactly like him. I was simultaneously relieved and disappointed to discover that it does not. Seville is my soap of the day for 4/20 because it reminded me of Charles the first time I read about it.\n\nDerby Premium was once again just so-so, this time in the Edwin Jagger. I could probably keep going with it but I already know it can't hang with my better blades by any measurement of quality (comfort, efficiency, results, longevity, cuteness of packaging, etc.) so I don't see much point in pushing it to its limits. Into the bin it goes.",

The other half is trying very hard to keep the magic alive despite all the kids do to try and pierce the veil (like staying up late on Christmas Eve to catch Santa). My 7-year old lost her second tooth on Thursday and there was not a scrap of cash to be found in the house outside of the kid's piggy bank. So on Friday we told her the Tooth Fairy didn't come because mom and dad were up so late getting mom home from the airport and the Tooth Fairy can only come when everybody is asleep. The kid also decided that she would move the tooth from the \"tooth box\" (which is located on a table in the living room) to under her pillow, just to be on the safe side. So there I was at 7:30 this morning trying to creep into her room to do my fatherly Tooth Fairy duties. The second I opened the door (which refused to open quietly), she slowly sat up in bed, looked under her pillow, mumbled \"still there\", and laid back down. Luckily, her back was to me the entire time, so she didn't actually see me standing there with cash in hand. Since there was no way I was going to be able to make the swap without her completely zonked out, I quietly backed out of the room and closed the door. I printed out a letter from the Tooth Fairy instructing the kid to leave her teeth in the box from now on and then I left the letter in the box along with her tooth cash. Then I proceeded with my morning.\n\nI was super excited when I was able to snag a Sonder set. Mood Indigo was a great soap, but it wasn't my favorite scent and ended up getting traded back to the Redditor who initially traded it to me. Almond Leather has a scent that was right in my wheelhouse (and goes incredibly well with CL Biblio), but it's more of a cold weather scent. I needed a spring/summer Mammoth and Sonder delivers. The soap performs excellently and the scent, which I wish was a little stronger, is a very pleasant citrus and sandalwood accord. Now that I think about it, it's almost like a glimpse into the richness of the life of a random stranger on the street. I thought about pairing it up with YRP (since I'm less than halfway through my sample) but decided to go with one of my all-time favorites: Eau de Treget.\n\nSeriously, though... 99% of parenting is just not killing the little monsters when they totally deserve it. \"The miracle of life\" is really more \"it's a miracle we let them live.\"",

Hah! What better soap to use today today besides none other than Quatre Cent Vignt. No brainer...\nThis brush is the densest brush I have ever come across. The tips are soft still, but it's not like any other brush I own or have used. I hear Judd Nelson as John Bender in my head saying \"pushing...maximum...density...\". It also has a short loft for a measured 32mm knot, which is just how I like em! It's so dense, it will barely splay, it's AWESOME!!!\n\nDamn fine shave if I don't say so myself!!!\n\nHope everyone is having a great holiday weekend if you celebrate or not!!!",

It was a much smoother shave - mostly DFS with BBS in places, but I ended up with a bunch of weepers. Such is life, tomorrow is another shave.\n\nI was pretty meh on Shamrock Tweed the first time I used it, but this time I loved it. Weird. It's a GIT clone, and I think between this and Wickham's Aventus clone (Classic 24) they are some of my favourite Wickham soaps. I may end up getting full sets of both.\n\nHave a great Sunday all!",

      "body": "[21st of April, 2019 \"Shore\"](https://i.imgur.com/xV0oZLF.jpg)\n\n* Razor: Karve\n* Blade: Astra\n* Soap: Declaration Grooming \"Shore\"\n* Brush: Stirling 24mm \"Finest Badger\"\n* Aftershave: Declaration Grooming \"Shore\" AS\n\n​\n\nMorning /r/Wetshaving,\n\n​\n\nI picked up this set of Shore from /u/EldrormR in a trade. He got my set of \"42\" and I got his set of \"Shore\". I love Declaration Grooming soaps. Sweet Lemon and Dark Fall are favorites of mine and that's not including Chatty Lux in the mix. Interestingly there were no notes on [Try That Soap](https://trythatsoap.com/collection/984/?product_type=soap) only the description of:\n\n​\n\n*\"Shore is the scent that* [Kramer wanted to bottle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBwKk3G8RMY)*. It doesn't smell like rum* [Rum Ham](https://imgur.com/gallery/VJbYn)*, dead fish, booze, nor sweat. It is peaceful and subtle, the perfect accompaniment to softly lapping waves on a pristine beach. You will smell the slightly salty seawater and the visceral perception of sand under the sun while you lay in the state somewhere between sleep and summer with a scent that could only be found on the Shore.\"*\n\n​\n\nWith no specific scent notes listed, I can only give you my general impressions. This is a summer scent. Primary notes I pick up are Coppertone and Beachgrass. There's a faint bit of saltyness in the background. It smells like you have spent a long day on the beach getting a tan. This is what I would call a tribute scent. It is not intended to serve as a recreation of the actual scent of a beach, but more to convey the overall experience of being on a beach (if that makes sense)\n\nThe scent is medium off the puck and remained so during my shave. I did a poor job lathering it this morning. Between blooming the puck and not wringing out enough water from my brush I did a poor job of lathering. I should have known better and that wasn't the fault of the Icarus soap base. Speaking of the base, Icarus happens to be in my top three soap bases and after I corrected my mistake, the lather was dense and extremely slick. After Shave was a matching scent, with the inclusion of menthol and gave a nice finish and post shave feel.\n\nIn other news, I'm working this morning and I won't be able to spend Easter with my kids. That upsets me a little bit. I know I can't always be there for every thing in their lives, but that dosen't mean that I don't want to. Game of Thrones comes on tonight and I'm looking forward to it. Last but not least, I'm really considering heading to the Maggards meet up in June. I have a busy summer ahead of me, including taking my family to Disneyland and then south to San Diego for Sea World but I think I can carve out a weekend to meet some of the folks that I spend so much time talking to online.\n\nHave a good Easter Sunday!\n\nRobot",

A nice way to celebrate 140 uses on the Nacet.\n\n#### ❧ Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Gillette - Sheraton 1938 ::: Gillette - Nacet ‹140 uses›)*\n\nBetter than I thought it would be considering I mowed down 2 days of growth with this old wonder. Minor tugging that was easy to tolerate. Great close result, in just 3 passes.\n\n#### ❧ Soap Notes\n*^(Fine Accoutrements - Fresh Vetiver)*\n\n40 seconds of loading from a soaked puck + 3 tsp water (in addition to maybe 1 tsp from the soak water) = 6 passes of amazing, slick, creamy lather. So good!\n\nNext time maybe a 25 sec load.\n\nSuch a great creamy, ultra-slick lather with that understated vetiver scent. I like it. One of the few weaker scents I'll keep around. So good. The performance of this soap really rivals anything out there, almost. I think it's pretty underrated.\n\nThis kind of performance, in a long-lasting hard soap makes me want to buy up his whole line!\n\n#### ❧ Brush Notes\n*^(Semogue - 2000 Boar‹11 uses›)*\n\nenjoyable to use. Can't believe it will just keep getting softer as more tips split! The double o-rings I put on have helped it to become one of my favorite Semogues.\n\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Cut flush to where I just see the tips (above average for me)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm)\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

This soap. It almost makes me gag when I smell it on the puck because the Rose in it is so intense and concentrated. Yech. It stank up my entire box of samples and the first time I opened it I thought, \"there's no fuckin' way I'm ever putting that on my face.\" 45 days and a test-lather on my hand later, here we are.\n\nCologne Russe is great once it's lathered up, yielding a very good medium strength rendition of old-fashioned roses like Hansa and similar breeds - not the weak, anemic hybrid tea roses sold in bouquets at flower shops... and **for as gross as it smells on the puck, it smells equally good on the face.** I think it starts out with some hints of herbs and fruit with the rose notes while the lather is on my face, then gradually transitions to a softer / sweeter rose post-rinse with some subtle violet and vanilla, but it's variations on roses the whole way through. The scent was 90% gone within about 15 minutes post-shave, which is good because my wife hates floral scents.\n\nShave #5 on the Lord wasn't fantastic. I feel like it's just a 3-4 shave kind of blade for me. While that isn't great, it's better than the blades that make me go \"nope\" on the first shave. They're good enough that I'll eventually finish off my package of blades but I won't bother to order more.",

      "body": "**April 21, 2019 - Easter Sunday**\n\n**Prep:** Hot Shower\n**Pre-Shave:** Proraso Green\n**Brush:** Stirling Badger Fan\n**Razor:** Rockwell 6S (R4)\n**Blade:** Gillette Nicet (4)\n**Lather:** [Barrister and Mann - Behold the Whatsis - Soap](https://trythatsoap.com/collection/1177/?product_type=soap)\n**Post Shave:** [Barrister and Mann - Behold the Whatsis - Aftershave](https://trythatsoap.com/collection/1177/?product_type=aftershave)\n\nI love this soap base. I think I might have only just figured it out. It has fantastic cushion and feels great post-shave. The scent for me is okay and I don't mind it once in a while.\n\nThe badger is becoming my favourite type of brush. I received a few brushes a couple weeks ago and honestly haven't felt the need to go back to my synthetics. Maybe it's a honeymoon phase. The two-band stirling feels great for face lathering. I thought I wouldn't use this one as much after trying the silvertip but nope, this is a great brush. I paid attention to the water and took my time lathering and ended up with excellent lather.\n\nThe Nacet blade is excellent so far. I had no issues this time with the R4 plate so it was likely the lather before that caused some issues. I find this blade nice and sharp but not harsh at all. I think I achieved close to BBS for the first time.\n\nPost shave is excellent - added a couple drops of water to the AS, which toned down the scent a bit. Great face feel for hours afterward.\n\nHappy (Easter) Sunday all!",

WTG, XTG/ATG, and clean up. Fatip is one of the most efficient razors I own and I love it. No irritation and a clean shave. I do have one ingrown hair on my chin so I could not go over that area too often. Overall, it was a satisfying shave.\n\n**The Soap** worked decently but lacked in post-shave qualities. The scent is the most controversial but it is slowly growing on me. It smells like a clean soap and a bit like a cheap spa soap. Regardless, it lathered up well and it took quite a bit of water. I put in more water into the brush around 4 times and it was still a bit dry. I did not have much time in the morning so I stuck with that but I could've added couple more strokes of water. It shaved well but after the shave, my face was as dry as it can be. It almost felt I washed my face with a body soap. It's not my favorite but for its price and easy to lather quality, it's a decent product to work with.\n\n**The Razor and Blade** combination was good. Even at its 9th use, Astra SP is holding up pretty well. The Fatip piccolo is proving to be one of the best razors for me. I do prefer a bigger handle but my grip is getting used to the smaller size. It's quite hefty as well but nothing to heavy to work with. Overall, a great combination.\n\n**The Brush** worked well. It gives just the right amount of scrub with a easy to lather quality. The water was dripping a bit too much in the beginning but as I lathered more, the creamy soap began to mix in with the water. The second and third pass was a bit thinner than first but it was fine for me. It's pretty much broken in for me and I'll continue to enjoy it.\n\n**The aftershave portion** was nice. Thayer's WH is great as usual and Stirling Balm was very moisturizing on the skin. It does feel a bit greasy after but it doesn't bother me too much. I do prefer a mentholated balm/WH but I don't want to put them too often. I feel that if I put too much menthol, my menthol-tolerance is going to rise and I won't be able to enjoy them in small amounts. I'm not trying to be a menthol-head but I do enjoy the chill.\n\nOverall, a great shave. Soap was decent but I definitely need a good aftershave portion to match the dryness. The razor blade combo was excellent and I can't wait to use them again. Post-shave was nice and moisturizing for the skin. I ended up with a clean face, ready for the Easter sunday. As for the next shaves, I am really excited. I have a new brush coming from Craving Shaving and it's going to be amazing. I put a bit more into the brush but I know it's going to be worth the price!",

And I try out my last of 3 Strop Shoppe soaps that I got in a lot a few months ago.\n\n#### ❧ Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Gillette - Sheraton 1938 ::: Gillette - Nacet ‹141 uses›)*\n\nA little tug on the first pass, but after that, comfy and enjoyable, giving me a surprisingly good bit of extra closeness at my trouble spot this time.\n\nNo irritation.\n\n#### ❧ Soap Notes\n*^(Strop Shoppe - Austin)*\n\nThem: \"grapefruit and bergamot with hints of amber and patchouli with an oakmoss, and sandalwood finish\". This one does have Tallow\n\n42 second load with lightly-wet, low-backbone boar brush + 2.5 tsp water = 5 passes of a nice, slick lather that was almost creamy. Enjoyable to use.\n\nScent: All I could pick up was some woodiness, and if I smelled the brush hard enough, maybe a hint of grapefruit. But with a soap that's a few years old at least, you can expect it to lose its scent somewhat.\n\nScent Strength: 2/10, barely present during shaving. Very low strength. I wonder if that was typical, or if this is due to age of the tub. My tub of Baker St has a similar weakness, my notes tell me.\n\nBowl - I used the XL version of this bowl:\nhttps://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3392930\n\n#### ❧ Brush Notes\n*^(Semogue - 1250 Boar‹12 uses›)*\n\nThis is a low-backbone boar that is very comfortable, but still a bit massagey. Soft tips and a delight to use, at just 12 uses. I would not want it losing any more backbone than this. Maybe some o-rings are in its future.\n\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Cut flush to where I just see the tips (above average for me)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm)\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

No weepers this time which was nice.\n\nNecromantic is another complex, clever scent from SW. It's impressive how much scent they manage to get into their soaps. The main note I get from Necromantic is rose. It's not a sickly sweet rose though, it's well balanced by the other notes. The wisteria and the honey bring out the sweetness of the rose while the ozone and dirt ground (!) it.\n\nI'm really not a fan of rose generally, but I find this scent really quite pleasant indeed. The performance was top notch as usual for SW.",

I'm really only using a scuttle because I'm having a hard time getting a dense cream from using it. I loaded with a dryer brush that usual, and with less water in the bowl to start, and it really work nicely.\n\n\nYou know, I really need to say that, for me, switching to synthetic brushes has made a huge improvement in my lathers. I have somewhat hard water, and I had no idea that using a boar brush was making my life that much more difficult. Nowadays, it seems like every lather problem I have has a really simple solution.\n\n\nPS - *Jasinthe* is very nice. I emailed B&M a few weeks back, asking him if it might come out in his new Icarus base next spring and he essentially said, \"Maybe, but it's called Excelsior BTW.\" I was pretty embarrassed. It was worse than the time I accidentally ordered a Whopper at a McDriveThru, and caught some crazy attitude from the voice in the box.\n\n\n*The Song:* I *reaaaally* hope Charles Manson wrote this one. It reminds me of early Animal Collective. Errr, probably more like early Animal Collective reminds me of this song.\n\n\n*Great shaves all!*",

Suffered a few cuts from the straight but no damage to show for it, oddly enough. Maybe a bit of swelling, but no blood. If you like florals, I think you'd like Lycanthropy. As a man who can tolerate florals but doesn't seek them out, I didn't mind it, but won't be getting a full size tub.\n\nLife is short, shave with good gear.\n\nEdit: Ahhhh, the cuts are revealing themselves! So many more than I thought!",

Big thanks to /u/rocketk455, you guys knocked it out of the park. I was a little worried about the grass and aquatic elements of this scent, as I'm not a huge aquatic fan and who wants to smell like grass? But the scent is well-balanced and enjoyable, an excellent spring scent.",

The lather created is dense, slick and creamy. I can see it being a little cumbersome to lather if overloaded though because it is very thirsty. You can either start with a super wet brush or add water for days and it just absorbs it. The scent is quite leather forward but upon dry down, it smells very close to Chatillon Lux Gratiot League Square, a scent I enjoy a lot.\n\nI had Friday off so it feels like I haven't been to work in forever, but alas, it is Monday and back to the grind. Have a good one people!",

Piacenza is a great, fresh scent and the soap is great as always. Lathers up so quickly with a badger brush. Great performance.\n\nThe Nacet was great again. R4 plate with this blade just glides so well. I'm hoping to get this blade to last as long as possible.\n\nPost shave choice was for the GF. She loves the scent. This AS works very well - a few drops and the skin feels smooth. I need to get some more deltus formula AS in my den.\n\nHave a good Monday folks!",

Luckily, I have the day off today, so I decided to start with a soap and aftershave combo that I find interesting. If you have this pair, give it a try. The Cheshire adds a transformative effect to Le Grand Chypre at least to my nose.\n\nI've used the Karve for a couple shaves now, and it definitely lives up to the hype I've seen. It has a way of finding a great angle on its own that makes shaving with it a breeze.\n\nAnyway, hope everyone has a great day!",

I was interested to try it but I doubt I would have gotten it on my own. Glad it worked out this way. Off the puck I got a strong scent of new tires and leather. As it lathered some of the other scents starting showing up. A little more woodsy and less motor oil.\n\nI was hesitant to use the AS. Its one thing to use a garage smelling soap but I didn't want to want to smell like that in the lab. I gave it a shot and it seems to me that the AS is more of a complement than a copy of the scent. A bit more spicy and woodsy. I was also surprised by the subtile menthol kick at the end. I will keep using this for sure. Maybe more of a fall/witer thing but a part of the rotation for sure.\n\nThis is for you /u/Kcam9908",

So smooth, so close!\n\nI haven't used these blades in TIME! That's not why I reached for it though. I used it because I didn't feel like removing the wax from a Wizamet. I took the blade out of the Wolfman yesterday to guarantee I don't use it again being complacent. Fool-proofing it from myself :P\nIt wasn't bad at all! I liked these blades, but never bought any quantity of them before finding blades I liked more. Despite possibly being the same blade as Lab Blue, they don't shave the same for me. Whatevs, I don't use these on the reg anyway so it's sort of irrelevant to me heh\n\nTop shave today! It doesn't get much if any better than this setup! **W00t!!!**\n\nHope everyone had a great weekend and it continues on to today!!!",

It has a sharp earthiness expressed on application, and was initially put off by it. I figured I'd pair it with Baudelaire as it jives best with FA, as my other fougéres clash pretty heavily. It was pretty rough for the first 30 minutes and I contemplated ahowering everything off, but it relaxed and the sweet notes of FA softened the bitterness of the Mousse de Sax. It smells exquisite and complex, and the wife likes it.\n\nIt was a gamble but I think it paid off. These are samples and I'm still unsure if I'd commit to buying.",

I haven't shaved for about 5 days due to my son being born and the craziness of it all. I'm was past designer stubble and entering he neck beard spectrum. For that reason I decided to swap over to the OC plate for this shave, first time ever using an OC. Only a single pass to save time and it was amazing, so smooth and efficient at cutting days an hairs, even on an A plate. Only one nick where the OC just exposes too much of a mole to the razor, normally the SB means it just glides over it.\n\nThe products themselves were great, chiseled face as always makes a great base that's easy to lather, even more so with all this growth!\n\nHave a great and and make sure you're appreciating your sleep!",

The main notes for me are mint and aqua. The mint was nicely cooling, although not nearly as much as menthol. Its performance was fine, but not up there with the SW and Wickham samples I've been using recently. On the other hand I've consistently liked all of SCs scents that I've tried so far.\n\nHave a great Tuesday all!",

Great to use Wickham again, but pretty much scentless. And trying cheap aloe gel as a post shave. (I don't like the gel. After several minutes, it made me itch.)\n\n#### ❧ Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Gillette - Sheraton 1938 ::: Gillette - Nacet ‹142 uses›)*\n\nchugging along with the good shaves. Just a little tugging on first pass. Then nice the rest of the way.\n\nNo irritation.\n\n#### ❧ Soap Notes\n*^(Wickham 1912 - Classic 24)*\n\nThem: \"With the essence of a 50s barbers shop, Classic 24 is a fruity, leather fragrance for the modern, classic man.\" Similar to Creed's Aventus, it would seem.\n\n1/4- tsp soap + lightly-wet boar brush + 3.5 tsp water + many sprays to hydrate even more = 6 passes of wonderful, creamy, slick lather. Man, a little goes a long way with this stuff, making it a really economical soap, when compared to most of the american croap artisans.\n\nScent: I could smell maybe some bergamot, but it was just too light to pick up anything else.\n\nScent Strength: 2-3/10, barely present during shaving.\n\nBowl - I used the XL version of this bowl:\nhttps://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3392930\n\n#### ❧ Brush Notes\n*^(Semogue - 1305 Boar‹12 uses›)*\n\nVery enjoyable. Smooth, no scritch. soaked for 1 hr before use. A delight. But not floppy, IMO.\n\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Cut flush to where I just see the tips (above average for me)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm)\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

I am thankful for this because for the last 4-5 shaves I've been discouraged because it doesn't seem to be making any progress. Coupled with the fact that I am pretty much nose-blind to the scent now means that the shaves aren't as enjoyable as I would like them to be.\n\nHave a nice Tuesday everyone!",

It's a light aquatic but with some body to it.\n\nI used the Heliopteris mainly because it's been gathering dust on my shelf. It's a fantastic base that had me double checking the ingredients to see if it even had alcohol in it (which it does). It really leaves my skin feeling nourished and moisturized but this particular scent is just not my cup of tea. Just very green and bright and I dunno. It's not bad, just not me.\n\nI needed to darken things back up, so I went with one of my absolute favorites of FG.

I feel like I might pick up the soap & splash set some day but I'm in no rush.\n\nI've already assessed Astra Superior Platinum blades in my ongoing shave experiments, but it's been a while and they were next in line in my box of blades so I figured, why not give them another go? It was pretty efficient, irritation free post-shave, but a little tuggy on *a few* of my ATG strokes (though not all). Might have been the razor at fault because the Flare Tip is probably the least tolerant of duller blades of the razors in my collection.\n\nAqua Velva Original Sport isn't available in the US as far as I know. It's an aromatic fougere with a bit of a citrus / mint opening and a very green / oak mossy drydown. Not as minty and floral as the Ice Blue. Burns a little going on from the alcohol but cools nicely with the menthol. Acceptable performance for my face.",

Within moments, the 7-year old was in our bedroom crying her eyes out. She said she was crying because last night she had a headache and couldn't sleep. My wife reported she was burning up and a quick check with the handy thermometer revealed a 102-degree fever. My wife gave the kid some ibuprofen and a cold wash cloth and sent her back to bed and I proceeded to scrape my noggin. The wife has more in-person meetings today than I do, so I get to work from home and keep an eye on the poor little monkey.\n\nGood shave this morning, though I'm not 100% sold on the scent of 88 Chestnut St. I'm not sure if it's just Icarus funk or if it's the frag, but something just doesn't smell quite right to me. I'm going to let the tub air out for a couple of days to give any animal funk a chance to wear off.",

This year has been a whirlwind and the ritual of shaving is something that gives me peace and centers me. I wanted something to reflect that as well as my age and preferences. After some consideration I landed on APR Fougere Trois.\n\nI'm just going to put this out there. Out of all the soaps and AS I have, out of any that I've tried, I choose FT. Try that soap lists the following scents:\n\n- Top Notes Include: Lavender, Bergamot, Clarysage & Petitgrain\n- Heart Notes Include : Geranium, Heliotrope, Rose, Orchid & Carnation\n- Base notes Include: Oakmoss, Tonka, Musk, Vanilla & Hay\n\nI can't really find any singular notes, it's incredibly well rounded. It's aromatic in nature, slightly floral, bright and green. It starts out with some minor soap notes but quickly faded. It feels like a classic soap. This could easily be a staple of a brand.\n\nFougere Trois uses the APR F2 soap base. The soap is medium firm and does not need to be bloomed for loading. I found the soap to really shine with lots of water. The lather was dense but not overly thick and provided plenty of slickness for the 36' Aristocrat. Post shave I used the matching AS. The AS is a matching scent and built around a base of alcohol, witch hazel and chamomile.\n\nIn other news, my wife and I will be kid free for several hours today. I think I'll take the opportunity to go out for a nice steak lunch and have a dram of Lagavulin or Ardbeg for my birthday. Keep it simple. I'll play it by ear.\n\nRobot",

No friction, no irritation or anything. Southern Paradise is a nice mentholated soap that I enjoy quite a bit during warmer months. Fantastic performer as well. I am not a fan of T&S, but I have to give credit where it is due. T&S splashes are fantastic - and I love the scent of Morocco - a smokey rose is how I would describe it. Finally, CG level 2 remains one of my top 3/4 DE razor - and I have to thank Wolfman razors for that. I was, somehow never interested in trying CG razors, but this one guy offered to trade a full CG2 razor (+ stand) for my Wolfman handle. It made no sense to me, but I gladly traded - and man I am so happy it happened.",

Performance-wise, there's nothing missing here vs. tallow, honestly. I also really like the non-alcohol splash, which seems to coat/condition my skin better than others I've tried. If I could recommend one tweak to the splash it would be to add a touch of menthol as I still love that cooling sensation and I think it would also neutralize the mild \"hotness\" feeling I seem to get from witch hazel splashes. A great shave all around with a nice scent that lingers. I may use this set again tomorrow.",

WTG, XTG/ATG, and clean up. Not a BBS but close enough for me. I did get a tiny nick but no real irritation. The brush felt better than my last time with it. The soap was good and everything just lined up well today.\n\n**The Soap** worked its magic today. The scent is decent. Still has a basil-heavy note but my snout is getting used to it. But the lather today was really creamy and slick despite the smol brush. Plenty of slick lather to work with and it lasted through the two and a half passes. I might get another Lather Bros soap with a bit more pleasant scent.\n\n**The Razor and Blade** combination was good. The blade is at its 10th use and it's still holding up pretty well. I did get a one nick which is a first. I might change out the blade if I get more nicks but for now, it's doing its job pretty well. The razor is mild but with the right angle, it cuts just fine.\n\n**The Brush** worked well. It is my travel brush so I do not use it at home. However, after looking at a post with the same brush, I gave it a try. Last time I used this, it was still scrubby and somewhat unpleasant. But today, the brush worked fine and gave a good amount of scrub. I'll still keep it as a travel brush but I want to continue breaking it in. I'm guessing that once it's fully broken in, it'll have a good amount of scrub + lather making ability.\n\n**The aftershave portion** was nice. Thayer's did its work and the L'oreal aftershave balm worked well. The L'oreal smelled a bit strong for me; a bit of floral and masculine fragrance. I bought it mostly because it works as a sunscreen. Not too greasy but it does have some oily features. I'll use it for outdoor purposes but not for everyday.\n\nOverall, a great shave. All of the products worked excellently and I enjoyed every part of it. I did rush through the shave a bit but I didn't get any irritation. Especially with a mild razor like the Tech, I can be a bit more \"wild\" with my strokes but nothing too crazy. The brush worked fine and the soap worked well above my expectations. I'm still waiting on the Craving Shaving brush... hopefully I can get it within this week! Can't wait to see and use it.",

It's almost too good. There are so many butters and oils in the soap that the lather remains extremely dense even when dialed in properly, but the slickness doesn't seem to suffer. The Spartacus scent (inspired by Creed Aventus) is also to die for. Despite this only being my first use of A&E products, I can already tell this base will be up there with my favorites if not number one once I get to know it a bit better.",

I got an easy DFS with BBS in places from the Polsilver with very little irritation. A great shave. Thanks to u/MalthusTheShaver for reminding / incepting me about Polis!\n\nCastle Forbes Cedarwood and Sandlewood is a nice straightforward woody scent. It's not particularly strong or complicated. My wife's scent notes are: \"smells like a mouldy bookshop\". (This is a good thing, she's a book nerd).\n\nBeing a croap it loads and lathers really quickly. Performance for me is not quite up there with SW or Wickham, which is a bit of bummer considering that CF sets cost ~2x as much.\n\nHappy Hump Day 🐪 all!",

Mostly cloudy, with a high near 58. Light and variable wind becoming northwest 5 to 10 mph in the morning. New precipitation amounts of less than a tenth of an inch possible. High tide at 4:03 this afternoon.\n\nGot this in the other night. Been wanting another MdC soap and after /u/iamsms mentioned [The English Shaving Company](https://www.theenglishshavingcompany.com/) being the cheapest place he's found to get it, even when you include international shipping. I picked it up. Took about a week to get here, so not that bad.\n\nNice shave. I don't seem to have the issue of MdC drying me out. Soap is lightly scented, when compared to MdC Agrumes. So I do wish it was a bit more prevalent. Went with Southern Witchcrafts - Necromantic to compliment the soap which is does wonderfully.\n\nHave a nice Wednesday everyone!",

The scent is based on D&G Light Blue. I actually went and smelled Light Blue in advance to compare the two.\n\nLight Blue is a sharp aquatic, and the soap is a pretty good approximation, but it's missing the sharpness. That's actually a good thing for me as I thought Light Blue was a bit too sharp. It's a nice, aquatic scent and I'd imagine just about anybody would enjoy it.\n\nThe soap base is a great performer. It's very easy to lather with excellent slickness. No issues at all during or after the shave. Very enjoyable to use.",

Lather was not quality. But passable. Scent off. Trying Ginger's Garden.\n\n#### ❧ Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Gillette - Sheraton 1938 ::: Gillette - Nacet ‹143 uses›)*\n\nThese guys did well despite an inferior lather.\n\n#### ❧ Soap Notes\n*^(Ginger's Garden - Amerikesh)*\n\nDont' know if I got an old puck or what, but scent was barely there and not all that attractive to begin with. Smelled more like just a soap base to me.\n\n45 second load with lightly-wet boar brush + 4.5 tsp water = 5 passes of unimpressive, but adequate lather.\n\nScent: meh. Maybe an old puck.\n\nScent Strength: 2-3/10, lightly present during shaving.\n\nBowl - I used the XL version of this bowl:\nhttps://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3392930\n\n#### ❧ Brush Notes\n*^(Semogue - 1800 Boar‹12 uses›)*\n\nI may be starting to feel some differences in this brush than his softer brothers. But it could be the thin airy lather. Good little brush nonetheless.\n\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Cut flush to where I just see the tips (above average for me)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm)\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

Before I knew it, there was lather everywhere! This is such a good every day 'quick' soap to use. It's easy to lather up and performs very well. I actually quite enjoy the post-shave feel on my skin as well - not drying.\n\nAfter using a similar brush with the Stirling two band badger, I found this one a little uncontrolled when lathering and painting the lather on. I think the less backbone was apparent here. I'm starting to lean toward the bulb or two band type of brush for this reason. Brush also lost a few more hairs (again!) with this shave.\n\nThis Nacet blade preformed very well again. I could see this being a good alternative to the Astra blade. Quite sharp but smooth at the same time.\n\nAnother DFS. Have a good Wednesday!",

The weight of the razor has made the shaves effortless and cut down on any irritation I was getting. Was definitely using too much pressure with my DE 89. Sticking with the 4 plate as I go back through my blades. Wasn't a big fan of the GSBs my first time through but we'll see how they hold up the next couple of weeks compared to the others I liked better before.\n\nA&E might be my favorite base at this point, I've only used it twice but the post shave feel both times has been better than anything else. Probably gonna go back to Sellout for my next shave to compare the two again. All in all got a DFS on two passes and a cleanup.",

The scent is a perfect match for Stirling Island Man, which is easily in my top 3 ( with Maggard Lomdon Barbershop and DG Darkfall.)\nThe little bit of menthol is spectacular in the splash. I have recently been turned on to mentholated products for summer and I think there is no turning back now. It's so darn refreshing!",

      "body": "Wednesday 4/24 SOTD\n\n​\n\n* Razor: Maggard MR22 handle with V3M mild SB head\n* Blade: Polisilver (4)\n* Brush: Dogwood Seascape w 28mm Maggard two band (non-HD)\n* Soap: B&M Reserve Cool\n* Post: PSC Caffeinated After Shave balm\n* Frag: Tom Ford Grey Vetiver EDP\n\nProduct Notes\"\n\n* **Razor / Blade**: \"Born To Be Mild\" continues, moving onto the new Maggard mild head after last week's pleasant run with an ATT M1 Calypso.\n* The Maggard V3M head is pretty impressive. Manages to be more efficient than an ATT M1, albeit with somewhat more risk of scrapes and irritation.\n* BBS lasts for maybe 8 to 10 hrs with V3M and Poli as compared to 6-7 hr BBS with ATT M1 and Poli.\n* The V3M blade is very sharply curved on the plate while the ATT M1 is more or less held very close to being flat. Looks like a RR Babysmooth and shaves in a somewhat similar way. Users who hated the Babysmooth should probably stay away from this one too.\n* The V3M appears to secure the blade almost entirely through central post hole. There are no tabs or pins on the underside of the head or on the baseplate. There are four brackets along the outer edge of the head underside that frame the blade in a rectangle, but these do not really grip the blade at all (at least not on my example) but instead form a sort of blade corner guard similar to what is seen on some GEM models.\n* Despite the single point securement, the V3M seems to center properly and stay aligned, and has no more chatter than any other Maggard head or even the Merk 34 / Jagger 89. The structure does not look like it will work, yet it does.\n* The head has minimal blade feel. When I used soaps with industry leading protection and post shave (e.g. Reserve, Glissant, WK DM) everything worked nicely. With second tier soaps (e.g. Catie's, Noble Otter) I had some mild post shave soreness and / or birdshot neck. Nothing awful, and a good post shave resolved the pain (though not the blotchy neck), but these results are notable due to the fact that the ATT M1 had no such problems.\n* So, bottom line: for $7, the V3M head can more or less run with the much costlier ATT M1 head. The V3M is more efficient and can definitely offer a consistent 2 pass BBS, same as the ATT, but the ATT is reliably pain and irritation free, while the V3M is somewhat less solid in giving an irritation free shave.\n* The Maggard V3 has more blade feel, similar efficiency, and less chance of post shave problem spots, but is also easier for newcomers to knick themselves with.\n* **Handle**: Special mention to the MR22: best handle Maggards made, the nuts and bolts are attractive and the handle is well balanced and offers many grip spots. Shame it is out of production!\n* **Brush**: The original Maggards two band. The example here shows why Maggard brought a nicer (and more expensive!) version out: it is a bit stiff even after long use and the lather loading and release is a chore. Still works and has decent face feel and backbone, but other mid-tier badgers from Elite and Stirling are far more impressive.",

This past year was both the best year of my life and the worst year of my life. I literally had the highest points and the lowest points of my life in the span of a year. I think the good probably outweighed the bad, though it may not feel that way right now\n\nThe shave was great, some great products, can't complain\n\nHumpdaaaaaaaaay\n\nEdit: I showered 30 minutes aftwr this shave, and when i wet my face i felt residual slickness come back.

It's my turn to go to the office while my wife works from home. The good news is that my manager's buying lunch for the team today and my dissolving org is buying dinner for everyone tonight. Tomorrow, everyone who rolls up to my director has a \"fireside chat\" with our new VP while the teams rolling up to the other directors spin off to their new orgs.\n\nGreat shave this morning with Mammoth Almond Leather. Very nice balance between sweet, marzipan almond and the darker leather. I feel like it pairs nicely with the dry, dusty, paper and leather smell of Biblio. Also, I've heard some people say that the first note they get off of Biblio is chocolate and I can't say that I noticed that this morning. As soon as it hits my nose, Biblio paints a picture of dryness and dessication. I suppose everybody's nose is different and that's why your mileage something something.\n\nThe wife and I have started watching Barry on HBO. Honestly, Henry Winkler is just a gift to the world, though I'm not sure if he's playing roles or if every role he plays is just Henry Winkler. But Anthony Carrigan steals the show as NoHo Hank. If you have the opportunity and you enjoy dark, absurd comedy, I highly recommend it.",

I'm going to up the ante to the R5 tomorrow to see how it goes. In particular the rockwell's head heavy design actually benefits its milder plates, but maybe not in the best way technique wise. I find it automatically presses down harder due to the heavy head. Also, I should note that the razor does very well on my trouble areas on the neck but takes longer to get my chin smooth. So, we'll up the plate and report back.\n\nThe soap is such a good performer. Catie's luxury cream (as opposed to the harder soap) is absolutely top notch in performance. The scent is pleasant, with a nice florals and a touch of ozone. Feeling good about this stuff, and it pairs well with the spring season.\n\nI think Polsilvers may be a little too much for me. I seem to always get more of a burn I the post shave after using Polsilvers, this has been true even in mild razors and when I'm paying very close attention to pressure and technique.\n\nOverall no cuts or anything like that, a very close shave and I'm happy with the results!\n\nHappy hump day!",

It's no secret that Ariana & Evans has quickly become one of my favorite artisans (elite soap base with an excellent post-shave feel). I think Peter from A&E was spot on when he mentioned this isn't some one dimensional pineapple scented soap. SoCal Hipster smells more like a blend of various fruits without putting too much emphasis on pineapple. It's a fruity warm weather scent that reminds me a bit of a tropical cocktail. Can't wait to receive A&E Uno and Platinum Barbershop which I've ordered shortly after SoCal Hipster.",

Performance for the dollar is excellent of course.\n\nBack to the 6S today after a few days with the 6C. /u/Hyvasuomi79 is right, the 6C glides much nicer. I think I might like the heft of the 6S more, helps me remember no pressure....I may have to try mashing them up with 6S handle and 6C head.",

This version smells fairly similar to Verde, but a little woodier. Still a very refreshing scent though.\n\nI decided this would be a good aftershave for today. It's light and refreshing albeit a little on the sweet side, but I'm cool with that. It doesn't clash with the soap by any means, so why not? It's not the most moisturizing aftershave, it's like a slightly better witch hazel. Not drying, not hydrating. I had applied a moisturizing sunblock anyway do it doesn't really matter if it is or not hah!\n\nDFS CAN I GET A HELL YEAH!!!!!\n\nHope everyone's having a great day!",

It was a simple day that was quiet with a few close friends and family around to celebrate it. I took some time yesterday to try some Tom Ford and Creed fragrances and capped the night off with a dram of Lagavulin. In short, it was exactly what I would have hoped for in a birthday.\n\n​\n\nWaking up this morning I decided I wanted to go ultra classical in my shave. I debated going for a Lavender or a Sandalwood scent before landing on some London Barbershop. I'll admit, I don't wear Maggards as much as I used to, but when I started wet shaving, London Barbershop was one of my first pucks of soap and it still smells pleasing today. Before I knew what a Barbershop scent was, I loved Clubman, thanks to my own barber. When I got into shaving, it was only then that I learned what a Fougere scent was and its relation to barbershop scents.\n\n​\n\nShaving with Clubman and a Barbershop soap feels comfortable. Its not overpowering and it feels like something classic. Coming off of Fougere Trois, it felt like a nice way to start another year of my life. In other news, I am looking for a good Fougere cologne. I tried several yesterday but would love any recommendations yall might have.\n\n​\n\nRobot",

Otherwise, mostly sunny, with a high near 57. Calm wind becoming south around 5 mph in the afternoon. High tide at 4:57 this afternoon.\n\nUsually I will try to do Theme Thursdays, even if it's a head shave day. I didn't want to today, mostly because the last shave I had with this tub exposed the bottom of the tub and I want to kill this soap. Plus I don't think it would be in good taste to PIF an almost used up tub. Plus getting up at 2am for work, I didn't want to be rummaging around in the bathroom trying to make decisions on what soap I wanted to PIF.\n\n**Soap/Scent:** As I said last time, I think because I'm using this soap so often I am going nose blind to it. Which isn't a bad thing in my book seeing as I'm not the biggest fan of this scent. Going to try to see if I can finish the splash off at the same time as the tub.\n\nHave a nice Thursday everyone!",

At least I kinda smell like gin thanks to Juniper in the cream.\n\nHave a good thursday ya'll!",

I picked up two of these tubs of GTB back when Groomatorium moved to Ohio, the caveat being they are \"imperfect\". I don't think I've lathered a Chiseled Face product since I began wetshaving, disliking the sample of Sherlock I got (gasp!), and not really touching it since. I really like this take on a barbershop scent and I'll have to pick up an AS to match. It lathered super nice and just 20 seconds of loading produced enough lather for 3 passes.\n\nLucky for someone that I picked up a second imperfect tub which I'll PIF, along with a second vial of Chattilon Lux Maggards Meet exclusive from last year. This has been opened but doesn't appear used, perhaps just a brain-fart open. Same as the others, pick a number between 1-100, I'll pick a random number tomorrow.\n\nLife is short, shave with good gear.\n\nPIF closed, number 25 was drawn. U/jimmg813 please come to the front!",

It's sort of like Cella but more sophisticated. The soap is very slick. It lacks the fattiness of my favorite artisan soaps but it still can give you a really nice shave and the scent and slickness make it really enjoyable.\n\nI really like the scent on Sandpiper too. It's warm and spicy and feels like the perfect scent for a date night. Too bad I have nowhere to go but work.",

My little brother is ~20 years younger than I am and wants to start shaving this summer so I'm going to set him up with some of my less-used gear. This will be his first brush.\n\nI wasn't enthralled with the Astra in my Edwin Jagger last time I tried them so I gave it another shot to see if time has changed my mind. Still not a huge fan of the face-feel, but I think that's more the razor than the blade. Got a nice smooth shave with zeeeeeeeeeeeero post-shave irritation, and that's the goal, right?\n\nWaves is just like Cool for me. Some days it smells amazing. Some days it's just ho-hum. Today it was pretty good. I noticed the bergamot as a distinct note for the first time. It mostly washed off post-shave, just leaving pleasant leafy lavender and geranium. Still having a tough time picking up any \"salt water,\" so I kind of wish I could smell this soap *without* that note so I could identify what it contributes to the composition.\n\nSpeaking of vaguely aquatic / citrusy / floral / fresh 90s fragrances, the first time I smelled Chrome on a sample blotter I thought, \"ah, another laundry scent. Never mind then.\" But then I read a lot of positive reviews online and decided to give it a test drive earlier in the week. On my skin I find it somewhat fruity and sweetly floral, and it has just a *hint* of pleasant laundry musks in the background (unlike Acqua di Gio, which just smells like cheap dryer sheets when I wear it). I don't get the \"metallic\" thing most people talk about. It's one of the few \"fresh\" scents I've enjoyed so far - most of them irritate my sinuses. I got thumbs up from three coworkers, my mom, my step-dad, and my littlest sister (twins with the previously mentioned little brother), so I think I'll pick up a bottle of this stuff for summer wear at the office.",

Cut the grass, had a few beers, got cleaned up, decided on a shave. I always get fine performance from Stirling, no complaints with that, but man I wish this scent was stronger. I barely smell it at all in the balm, and the soap is very light on the scent. I mean, it's a banger of a scent. I just wish it hit me up in the nose holes a bit more. I barely ever use alum, but since I had a tiny little weeper on my chin, I figured fuck it. Regarding the song, I finally popped on the I Know What You Did Last Summer soundtrack that I picked up on Record Store Day a couple weekends ago, which contains one of my favorite songs, the Type O Negative cover of Summer Breeze.

Nice concept though!\n\nProduct Notes:\n\n* Razor / Blade: The Maggard mild head continues to impress, being sort of a hybrid of the RazoRock Baby Smooth and the ATT M1 heads. Pretty comfy shaver, quite efficient. Would work perfectly as a daily shaver even for those demanding a BBS in two passes.\n* Soap: A wonderful scent, working from a bitter citrus in the tub to a restrained floral / herbal mix once lathered. Nice design on the scent from Wholly Kaw! The base performance is excellent being in the top tier of soaps for me. The appearance of the lather once perfected is unique, looking less like yogurt than paste, but the comfort during and after the shave is excellent.\n* Frag: Many love Bat. To me, it smells like a pertrichor and I get none of the grassy or fruity notes that others smell. It's a weird and interesting scent and lasts forever, so I kind of approve, but it's nowhere near my favorite Zoologist scent, despite its critical acclaim.",

I've been almost exclusively using my Dogwood/Maggard SHD when I reach for badger, which has been most of the time lately. The Shavemac is a good brush. It doesn't hog lather like the SHD, and it's gelled tips are nice. It also has more backbone. I think I prefer the dense knot and the softness of the SHD though. Its face-feel is just fantastic.\n\nFirst time shaving with M&M. It was very easy to lather, had great slickness and residual slickness. It's a really soft soap that would be very easy to overload. I don't have a Creed Silver Mountain Water aftershave, so I just went for the Taum Sauk because I love it. I'm realizing that Juniper is my jam.",

(sorry they're only sample sizes) I've also got a tuck with 4 derby premium blades I'll toss in as well (they cause maaaaajor irritation for me) if it's international I wouldn't be able to send the aftershave, but would send the other items.

The random number generator landed on 66 ( http://imgur.com/a/YTNrJdY ) so that means u/TheCelloLife is the winner with their submission of 57. When you get a chance PM me your address, if it's before 11 a.m. Central time I'll get it out to you today, otherwise it'll go out tomorrow morning. Thanks for commenting.

Today I tried the R5, and it kicked up the efficiency a notch. I found that it was easier to get my chin and mustache area clean. Also it was still quite comfortable for a daily shave. I definitely felt more blade on my ATG pass, but WTG seemed pretty similar.\n\nWhile R5 is probably the plate for me upon this revisit, I'm going to try the R6 tomorrow.\n\nOne more go with this blade and I'll switch back t my Astra SPs.\n\nHappy shaves folks!",

WTG, XTG, and ATG clean up. Wow. Just Wow. That was an ideal shave for me. Great lather. Great razor. Great post shave. Feels awesome at the end.\n\n**The Soap** worked well. I expected a tiny bit more structure from the lather but I think I made a mistake. The brush loaded a bit too dry for my taste and it resulted with a thinner lather than usual. However, even with the thinner lather, Stirling performed well so I cannot complain other than the visual aspect. As for the scent, I'm really digging it now. At first, it was decent but now I smell a bit more citrus which I enjoy. Great soap when you have the time to enjoy the whole process.\n\n**The Razor and Blade** combination worked well. It was a medium aggressive setup. There was no tugging at all and no irritation at the end. The razor did skip a bit but I think that was because of the thinner lather. Regardless, I got a clean shave and I cannot complain.\n\n**The Brush** felt luxurious. Silvertip definitely is up there in the quality of the brush. Felt soft but enough scrubbing to exfoliate the skin. A tiny bit softer than my broken in boars but it was an amazing experience. Especially with the great value of a Yaqi brush, this is a recommend for me.\n\n**The aftershave portion** was great. I haven't used the alum block in a while and it definitely stung a bit. I had stings here and there but nothing crazy. With the ice cold balm, my skin was at an optimal state. Not too greasy or not too dry. Moisturized, clean, and ready to head out.\n\nOverall, a great shave. Everything went well except for the thinner lather. Next time, I will retain a bit more water in the brush to make a creamy lather from the start. Other than that, everything was great. Couple things for next shave. I got two brushes incoming: Craving Shaving brush and Omega R&B. I am so excited to use them. There was a tracking problem but it is solved now. I'm thinking of using the new Siliski soap with the new brush.",

He got to my place at 9 and we \"kicked off\" from there. I'm not sure it was the alcohol that did me in and not the lack of sleep. I slept through my alarm, threw some clothes on and ate breakfast with him and the family rather than shave. Getting through your day hungover at my age gives you a new perspective on how easy your days REALLY are when you aren't hungover, but again, maybe I was just exhausted. By eight o'clock today I was ready for a shower and to call it a day. I took a look at Theme Day Thursday's announcement and knew what I had to do. I decided I would take the \"pepsi challenge\" using my most \"elite\" and \"unobtanium\" soap that I had and compare with an absolute \"dog\" that I picked up in a purchase here no too long ago. Some people have been asking, \"Have we hit Peak soap-making?\" So here is my contribution to an answer. Part one of a two part SOTD or night-- whatever.\n\nI was running about 36 hours of grizzled old man whiskers at this point of the day. I overloaded the Talbot's and had soap coming up out of my bowl while I was building the lather. Its just so ridiculously thirsty. The scent is straight forward, I love it and I would consider it medium strong. Its with you in the bathroom and it lingered for the next couple hours. I did use the Lavande Poivre as well though. After the first pass I added a little more water and again had soap coming out of the bowl and still not quite the shiny lather that I know the Talbot's will make. Second pass I was starting to get somewhere. I added more water before the third pass and still could have added more. I knew I'd be shaving in about 12 hours so I went WTG, XTG, WTG and hit face with the witch hazel, splash and balm. It was a nice \"recovery\" shave. I felt refreshed and ready for bed. While I really enjoy the Talbots I don't know that I'd kill myself to get another. Its good soap, but is it THAT much better than Champs de Lavande or Pure Lavender or Lavender Reserve? I wonder. I'll have more of an idea tomorrow after I lather up the Shannon's soaps Lavender and Eucalyptis that looks like it was made in 1987.",

Please reply and inform him if your erection lasts for more than four hours as a result.**\n\nSo do we all know that there are tubs of soap circling around our community like comets endlessly circling the sun. They pop into view every now and again only to vanish before seeing them in yet another WTT or WTS listing, probably as part of a lot. For some of us we wrinkle our nose and wonder about storage space before we finally welcome them into the den. I don't know how old this particular tub of Shannon's is. I know the artisan is using a different label at this point but at the rate some soap-makers innovate this tub could be 6 months old or 5 years old, I don't really know. I do know that the barcode and price tag on the bottom of the tub *look* like they're from 1987 with something scrawled on the underside in ballpoint pen. Those could be indicative or maybe just an accident. The soap is firm and looks as though there have only been a few attempts to lather it. Why didn't anyone want to love this soap and kill it? I'm immediately suspicious its because it sucks, why else would one of these wretched tubs end up circling the sub like a sad mangled bath toy circling the drain.\n\nThe first thing I noticed as I got ready to lather the Shannon's was that soap tub FIT into the lid. This is one of my favorite things about Declaration soaps, the packaging is thoughtful. My laughably small bathroom gets crowded with soap, toner, balm, witch hazel, razor, bowl and brush. Its always a dance to find a place for each thing and the fact that I don't even have to think about the lid is good. I took a sniff from the tub wondering if any scent would even be left in this artifact and I could still pick-up on the lavender and there behind it something that reminded me of eucalyptus. Its supposed to be lemongrass I reminded myself. I gave the soap a hundred swirls just like the Talbots before I started working it in the bowl and toward the end I started to wonder if it would make marshmallow swirl's like the DG bison base will sometimes. That filled me with hope, had I really stumbled onto an ugly stepsister to the bison base? I started hitting it with water and it starting building into a very uniform lather with very fine bubbles. It took water and more water before finally beginning to shimmer. The lather looked very promising. I rubbed a little between my fingers and immediately felt a little let down. It was slick but didn't have that residual slickness many of the elite bases do. Slapping it across my face I was hit with the lather and slight hint of what to my nose reads as eucalyptis. After living with eucalyptis trees in NorCal I think of them as a fragrant herbal note with a hint of cat pee. Not Night Music \"booty-crystal\" stinky-- but an unpleasant twang to the scent. It was very brief either because of how the scent was composed or due to the fact that this soap was poured into the tub when hair metal still ruled the airwaves and people actually listened to music on the radio. The slickness underneath, it was fine. Just fine. Not great, not terrible-- but fine. I did three passes none of which were against the grain and I went on with my life. If I was chasing the cheapest shave possible I think Shannon's soaps in lots from the Bazaar would definitely be on my radar. Maybe we hit peak three years ago. Its amazing what $12 could get you in 1987.",

Verdict: loved it. Going to stick here a bit and see how it goes before jumping up to a 6.\n\nDid two passes and some touch up and it's the closest shave I've gotten without any irritation\n\nGreat start to a Friday!",

High near 48. East wind 5 to 10 mph, with gusts as high as 20 mph. Chance of precipitation is 90%. New precipitation amounts between a quarter and half of an inch possible. High tide at 5:53 this evening.\n\n**Razor:** Just got this in last night. Waiting list number on the Charcoal Goods website finally came up and chose this one. I like this one much better than the Lvl 2 plate. Decided to go with the copper because it seems like you don't see very many around. Can't wait to start using it more.\n\n**Soap:** I think I underloaded this moning. Still was nice, but not as nice as it could have been. The scent is great. I can't wait for the EdC to be released. I think this could definitely be a desert island soap.\n\nHave a nice Friday everyone!",

Soap due to a lanolin sensitivity and aftershave i've just never picked up because I prefer things with a bit more skin foods in them. I had bought a Hipster bar soap, and really dug the scent, so I figured i'd give the aftershave a whirl. And if you're buying the aftershave and EDT samples are also available of the same scent, well of course.\n\nIt's actually might lighter than I thought it was going to be. I like it, but i'm not as enamored with it like I thought I was going to be. I think I like it more in soap form...\n\nIt's not in TTS so i'll paste the notes: This scent boasts of amber, coffee, musk, leather, and wood are rounded out by citrus, floral, and vetiver notes.",

Lathering a small sample and not knowing if there was any trick to NO soaps, I tried the drier brush, paint soap on face and slowly add water, method. I ended up with a thinner lather where I barely had enough for three passes.\n\nHowever, the performance was on point. Such a good slickness that I didn't have any issues even with a thinner lather. The scent was a little too much 'dirt' for me. It smelled great to begin with but then lathering up, I could only smell wet dirt. Reminded me of the days of tending my garden in the spring. Not something I'd like to put on my face however. That being said, the scent is not strong and I stopped noticing any hints of it quickly after the shave.\n\nThe Nacet is running strong!\n\nHappy Friday friends!",

My neck has always been a trouble area so I'm not pushing it as I tend to get some irritation.\n\nI'm a sucker for the Aventus dupes and Sellout doesn't disappoint. I like the post shave feel of Spartacus slightly more but the menthol kick from the Sellout AS is nice for a few minutes.\n\nVoskhod was one of my favorite blades my first time through and for the price may be where I end up. Gonna use it for the next few shaves before going through 2 or 3 other blades.\n\nHalf day at work today to volunteer a little bit with the company but a good start to my Friday.",

I bought it at maggard's last blowout. Its almost a cream, but a little more dry. Even at half price, it still too expensive. Its not a good value as it won't last that long. It comes in a similar tub as AoS creams do but I transferred the TR to another tub because the original was too big.\n\nIn sadder news, I decided to completely throw away an almost full tub of sudsy soapery unscented w/ tallow as it was irritating my skin. It was a nice soap, reminded me of stirling in that it was going to last a long time. While I could have sold/traded it away I just decided to purge it. It was a waste but there comes a point where if something does not work for you, a change must be made. Skin irritation by the soap itself is something I can act upon. The cat o nine tails is pretty bracing stuff but just finishing up a sample as I would not buy a full bottle.",

Today was also the second day of shaving with my borrowed Old Type. I won't lie, it was more aggressive than I was expecting and I got bit a little. If I am being honest, it is rare that I shave with the same soap twice a week, I have so many in my collection and I enjoy mixing it up. That said, I love a good, clean fougere and Fougere Trois is the best I have tried to date. Speaking of, I just ordered a sample of Houbigant Fougere Royale off of /r/FragSwap and I am pretty excited to get it in. I am actually in the process of ordering several different fragrances and I will list them below. I would love to hear your thoughts on them. I like Leather, Tobacco, Marine and Fougere scents.\n\n​\n\n* Penhaligon - Blasted Heath\n* Bvlgari Aqva - Marine\n* Acqua di Parma - Colonia\n* Santa Maria Novella - Tabacco Toscano\n* Parfums de Marly - Herod\n* Tom Ford - Oud Minerale\n\n​\n\nWhat do y'all think about this list? Am I leaving off anything you absolutely adore? Let me know. I want to expand my fragrance collection and I welcome your input.",

Just get the brush appropriately wet, swirly around the tub and then lather up. No measuring extra water or worrying you might have over-hydrated... just load and go. Also, GTB smells f*****g great. Throw on the Lavender Poivre for some extra calm and I'm very nearly ready to face the day.\n\nSunday, however... everyone dies. We've got Endgame in the afternoon and the battle of Winterfell that night. I may be taking a bereavement day on Monday.",

Very interesting scent. Actually, oddly remind me slightly of a bay rum, with wood no rum. I'm not sure if that makes any sense. Whatever it smells like, it smells good! And of course, performance is top notch as always. And I love the dubl duck. I wish my other straights shaved that well. Not sure if it's just a better blade, or if it has a better edge than the others, but it is definitely on eof my most comfortable shavers.",

When I was first getting started with the Rockwell a long time ago I remember thinking the 6 was much more aggressive for some reason, maybe I was just less experienced. I think the R6 would be fine for daily shaving.\n\nNone of the Rockwell plates are too aggressive or worrisome for someone who's intermediate or above.\n\nIn any case, it's Friday folks!

      "body": "Friday 4/26 SOTD\n\n* Razor: Maggard MR22 handle with V3M mild SB head\n* Blade: Polisilver (6)\n* Brush: Jefferson Declaration B1 27mm\n* Soap: WK King of Bourbon double milk tallow\n* Post: Aqua Velva 5 in 1 Sensitive balm\n* Frag: Chanel Egoiste EDT\n\nProduct Notes:\n\n* **Razor / Blade**: The Poli is letting me know it's on it's last shave, but the combo still gave a marvelous two pass BBS. The verdict on the Maggard Mild head is highly positive - can certainly match the performance of the RR Babysmooth and the ATT M1 head, and the face feel is as mild as the M1. Maggard V3M is certainly much more mild than the Babysmooth.\n* The downside to the V3M is that it is somewhat more likely to scrape / irritate if you aim for BBS, due, IMO, to the radically curved blade in the cap. The ATT M1 by comparison is not quite as potentially efficient as the V3M, but in my experience is utterly free of any post shave irritation potential.\n* Compared to the regular Maggard V3 head, I like the V3M more as it lends itself to a more reliable two pass BBS with minimal blade feel. The V3 is more of a three pass razor, but the less radical head design gives less chance of irritation even with a third pass. The V3M is more of a \"gambler's head\" and also for those that want minimal blade feel.\n* Given the price point ($7), there's no reason not to own a V3M if you are at all interested in a mild daily shaver and don't want to pay AS-D2, M1, or even Babysmooth prices. I was pleasantly surprised by the V3M and would actually call it my favorite Maggard's head, as it offers something relatively unique in the market. (V3 is a nice DE 89 clone, but those are pretty common.)\n* **Soap:** One of the finest WK scents in the brand's best base yet. There is some debate over how \"bourbony\" the scent is, but assuming the user likes vanilla, this is a marvelous iteration of that scent. The double milk base is impressive and represents an increase in the quality gap between the WK vegan and tallow formulas.",

      "body": "Last night's shave -\n\n**Razor:** 1954 Gillette Super Speed\n\n**Blade:** Voskhod (1)\n\n**Brush:** Yaqi Mysterious Space Timberwolf\n\n**Lather:** Stirling Barber Street concoction\n\n**Post Shave:** Witch Hazel, Lucky Tiger, and some Cetaphil to help with irritation\n\nI've got quite a bit of neck irritation going on after last night shave. It's mostly a hold over from my last shave which I didn't have a chance to post. Tuesday night I was in a hurry and really needed a shave so I went with the Nivea goo I've still got and my cartridge razor. I've done one cartridge shave since making the switch, but I haven't used the goo since then. This was a mistake. Not sure if the razor works less efficiently on my neck than I remember or it was a combo of the goo and razor, but I needed way too many passes to clean up my neck and it is feeling the pain now. Several weepers and lots of irritation.\n\nThis is also only my second shave with the super speed, but it definitely seems a bit more difficult to use than I was expecting. Either that or my face just needs to recover. Both shaves gave me some neck irritation though and I wasn't really expecting that the first time. Will likely switch over to my tech or a similarly mild razor until the irritation dies down, but the super speed shouldn't really be all that more aggressive than the tech in my understanding.",

WTG, XTG, and ATG clean up. The shave was decent but I did get one weeper by the chin and slight irritation by the neck. Great brush and the post shave definitely calmed down the skin.\n\n**The Soap** worked well. I got the 2oz sample and put it into a stick. I definitely prefer a tub over stick but I gotta do with what I have. I face lathered with it and it came out to be a creamy lather. Slightly thinner than what I prefer but it performed well regardless. The scent is interesting. Smells a bit like Tabac and a dirty spice combined. Initially, it was a bit off-putting but I think I'll enjoy it later down the lane.\n\n**The Razor and Blade** combination decently. The first pass was no problem. The second pass and the clean up was a bit more aggressive than I would like. Granted that I shaved yesterday close to a BBS, I shouldn't have used a OC razor. I wanted another BBS today and I got it, with a slight irritation on the neck. Next time, I'll reserve this combo for a bit more beard growth.\n\n**The Brush** was great. Not only does it look beautiful but it performs well. It reminds me of the 26mm Yaqi Tuxedo brush but with a bit better grip. The Duro knot is nice but I do prefer a natural bristles over synthetics. It's got dense knot and fair bit of backbone but overall, very soft. Lathered up well and I loved the whole experience.\n\n**The aftershave portion** was great. WH calmed down the skin and I had a hint of menthol with the Nivea cooling balm. I need to lower my menthol doses if I want to keep the cooling sensation. Don't want to abuse that chill, haha.\n\nOverall, a good shave. I didn't need to shave today but I really wanted to use the new Craving Shaving brush. I'm glad I shaved and got to use that brush. The razor combo is definitely a bit more aggressive than I thought so I'll use that for heavier beard. Tomorrow, I'll be receiving the Omega R&B so I'm excited for that. I'll be using it for the Sunday shave with either Proraso Red or another Stirling.",

I went to the cabinet looking for Seville but as soon as I saw the Bay Rum I knew it was right for today. SWMBO agreed mentioning how nice I smelled as I walked into the bedroom from the bathroom. It makes me smile walking into the office thinking I smell more like a pirate than an overcivilized dryer sheet. That's probably wishful thinking though. Happy Friday everybody.",

The weight is balanced well and the longer handle works well for my gigantic hands. I know some people knock the looks, but I still think it's a handsome shaver. Herc Soap Co. is my favorite lesser known artisan. The base is easy to lather and has excellent face feel post shave. This scent is one of my favorites, and I'm going to assume I smell mostly the Juniper Berries and Jasmine. I received a few samples from Imaginary Authors and thought I would give Falling Into the Sea a try. Notes listed are: Lemon, Bergamot, Grapefruit, Lychee, Tropical Flowers & Warm Sand. My general impressions are that it smells like Aventus at the beach. A great citrus opening that turns into a floral and almost coconut scent to my nose.\n\nAnother amazing album by the Minneapolis based After the Burial. Glad to see the local boys still killing it!",

Shaving at an odd time. Trying out Daybreak again to see if it is to lowly-scented for me. It is. And now we're just 5 away from 150 on the blade!\n\n#### ❧ Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Gillette - Sheraton 1938 ::: Gillette - Nacet ‹145 uses›)*\n\nblade and razor cutting well, just a little bit tuggy on the first pass. But still excellent close shave, though it requires buffing, or extra pass.\n\n#### ❧ Soap Notes\n*^(Stubble Buster - Daybreak)*\n\nThough I really like the price and performance, this is another Stubble Buster soap that is just too unscented for me, I'm afraid.\n\n30 second load with lightly-wet boar brush + 4 tsp water = 5 passes of slick, creamy, very nice lather.\n\nScent: I mainly pick up leather and amber, not in use, but only when I bury my nose in the bowl.\n\nScent Strength: 1/10, not really present during shaving.\n\nBowl - I used the XL version of this bowl:\nhttps://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3392930\n\n#### ❧ Brush Notes\n*^(Zenith - B10 Boar Red‹13 uses›)*\n\nWith that ultra-long, inadvertent soak on the Semogue 2000, it has eclipsed this brush in comfort, but that's hardly fair, isn't it. When more of these bristles get split tips, I'm sure it will compete voraciously. 13 uses is still quite young.\n\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Cut flush to where I just see the tips (above average for me)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm)\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

I really like the fresh aspect of it, which is a nice change from a lot of fougere scents that seem to be dirtier. It's a wonderful scent for the spring.\n\nI'm excited to pick up Taxes today. I'll be ready at noon with my finger on the keyboard. Happy Saturday everyone.",

Patchy fog before 9am. Otherwise, mostly cloudy, with a high near 54. Breezy, with a west wind 10 to 20 mph. New precipitation amounts between a tenth and quarter of an inch possible. High tide at 6:51 this evening.\n\nExcellent shave this morning. Trying the Xerjoff out this morning. When we originally tried it more than a year ago for Frag Fridays I did not like it. The opening was way to sharp for my liking and it just stayed that way all day. Over the past year I have really expanded the frags that I have tried, and like so seeing if anything has changed in regards to this scent.\n\nHave a nice Saturday!",

Easy to get a thick and slick lather. Post shave was also really good. The scent on the other hand, didn't groove with me. I picked up some good citrus, but for my nose the hops just came across dusty.\n\nOverall it was a good shave. No irritation or nicks.\n\nHappy Saturday!",

Lathered up it's very green and herbal with a more complex scent than TryThatSoap's 3 scent notes would suggest. There's lavender, sage, a bit of rose, some peppery carnation, grassy coumarin from the tonka... Honestly, to me it's like taking a fresh bouquet of herbs and flowers and then throwing them into a blender, stems and leaves and all. More green than floral. I don't hate it but it's too aromatic/herbal for my taste.\n\nHowever, it served very nicely as an opening to my Aqua Velva Green, which nudged things in a fresher, sweeter green direction more in line with my tastes, and then I thought, \"this fresh green train needs to keep going... how about some GIT?\" So I threw on some l'Aventure Knight and the final melange of fragrances is absolutely divine.\n\nAs for performance, it's Reserve. Lather it up properly and it's great. I started with an extra face lather and then soaked my face with a wet cloth with the soap on the skin for a minute before I re-lathered for my first pass. I always find my 2nd and 3rd passes are slicker than the first, so I eventually came to the conclusion, \"why not just do an extra lather and soak before I start shaving?\" Seems to improve the first pass for me.\n\nThe Astra / Tech combo is about as close to perfect as I've found so far for my face. It's so smooth that I can barely even tell if the blade is engaging the whiskers as I shave and the results are perfectly BBS with 3 passes and a few light touch-ups. Zero irritation during or after the shave. I'll be curious to see what shaves are like once I move into some sharper blades... does it get *even better than this?*",

A good scent, but not amazing. I won't be picking up a full tub because there are too many scents for me that are amazing to have anything that is just \"good\"\n\nPerformance was solid. Nothing crazy but an easy to work with, no fuss base. I would compare it to CF in that regard, just effortless. Also, something weird that I found qas that residual slickness was even better than primary, which has never happened to me. interesting phenomenon\n\nIve been super busy, excited to do nothing.

The good news is it's now the weekend. The bad news is, it may be the most heart-rending weekend in nerd history. The wife and I have tickets to go see Avengers tomorrow afternoon and tomorrow night is the Battle of Winterfell. I'm staring at my [TV Deadpool](https://tvdeadpool.xyz/game/season/gameofthrones-08) picks right now trying to decide if I should bet hard on Tormund just to ensure he survives the episode. It's gonna be so brutal they're not even offering an over/under on total named character deaths this week. Anyway, here's how I'm betting:\n\n* $10 on Grey Worm at 7:5 because he made retirement plans last week and you don't get to make retirement plans on this show\n* $10 on Jorah the Explorer at 9:5 but I'm skipping the Grey Worm/Brienne/Jorah parlay bet because I don't think this is Brienne's time to go.\n* $20 on Theon at 4:1 because he's going to heroically and tragically die to save one of the Stark kids as the end of his redemption arc\n* $5 on Beric at 8:1 I don't think he's going to get killed but I do think he's going to pass on that breath of life he's got to bring back the the Hound and, in so doing, the lightning lord's candle will go out\n$1 on The Night King at 50:1 because why not put down a tiny wager on those odds? However, I don't think it's going to happen because I'm with the people that think the Night King won't even be at Winterfell because he's already on his way south.\n\nSadly, there's nowhere to bet on And Man taking out Thanos in a particularly distasteful way and even if there was I wouldn't be allowed to wager because the outcome of that particular wager is already known to thousands and thousands of people.",

I heard this morning that the new Black Eagle drop for brushes crashed his website. The same was true a few weeks ago for Dogwood Handcrafts with Stephens hybrids. Look at how fast Declaration Brushes sell out or the secondary market for Wolfman Razors. Yes my friends, FOMO is real.\n\nMy FOMO has been a Declaration Grooming Unicorn Ivory Brush. What's special about it? I could talk about how it's handcrafted and the knot is hand to tide, or how Ivory is a classic color. But, the truth is, I think it looks beautiful and I want one. Is that silly? I don't know, for whatever reason I have made in my mind that it's something that I would appreciate. FOMO I suppose.\n\nSpeaking of FOMO, that's what I shaved with today. FOMO is a dupe scent of Hugo Boss that's made by Hugo boss. I would be lying if I said that the stunning pop culture artwork didn't play a role in choosing it. The fragrance was *strong* off the puck, but post lather the fragrance mellowed and became pleasant.\n\nThe performance itself was good. The soap was medium soft in the tub and I pre bloomed for 30 seconds. The brush lathered quickly and the lather itself was density and medium sickness. This was my first experience with Oleo and I have nothing to compare it to but I would place it somewhere around Chiseled Face performance wise. Post shave skin felt good and the AS only added to it.\n\nSo /r/Wetshaving whats your FOMO? Is there something your chasing or is there another Oleo soap you would recommend?\n\nRobot",

A nice piece of history to go back to. Followed the Williams recipe/process that has become my favorite.\n\n#### ❧ Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Gillette - Sheraton 1938 ::: Gillette - Nacet ‹146 uses›)*\n\nThese guys did great and had worlds of glide from the snot-slick Williams.\n\nNo tugging or irritation.\n\n#### ❧ Soap Notes\n*^(Williams - Mug Soap)*\n\nI want a method for Williams that flows with my regular routine, so all it took, after a lot of permutations: I soak the soap for a few mins in cold, and only enough water so that before building the lather, I can dump that into my lather bowl and have it be lather water. From there, it's pretty much standard.\n\nSeveral min presoak in cold water on top of puck (2.5 tsp) + 20 sec load with a medium-lightly wet brush + 1 tsp water = 5 passes of slick, creamy lather! I like an extra pass or two for margin's sake.\n\nI put 2.5 tsp cold water on the soap to soak for several mins. Then that went into the lather bowl. So, no soap wasted!\n\nThe lather was just perfect! Creamy, while also being super slick.\n\n#### ❧ Brush Notes\n*^(Stirling - Boar 24mm Factory Seconds‹13 uses›)*\n\nfelt very stiff today. But not uncomfortable. This guy's still young, so this is okay that it hasn't been as quick as the Semogues and Zenith.\n\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Cut flush to where I just see the tips (above average for me)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm)\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

At least until the full size soap arrives on the slow boat from Canada.\n\nI've almost tried all of my Wickham and SW samples now, just a few more of each to go. I ordered a batch of WK samples to try next, as I've heard so many good things.\n\nThe Polsilver rolls on. I don't think I'll ever be someone who can get 100+ shaves out of a Nacet, but I'll be very happy if I can get 10 comfortable shaves out of this blade.\n\nHave a great Sunday all!",

The smell of the Summer Storm soap didn't particular excite me. *In my opinion*, it smelled horrible. It was like stepping into a humid room which has been without air for some days. Or finding one of your tshirt that was stashed in your closet for months. That kind of \"moldy\" smell you'd know if you live in a region with high humidity.\n\nBut I've heard so many good things about CF, and maybe it was just my sense of smell that was horrible. I decided to give it a try anyway. Luckily that smell got away while lathering. I was VERY IMPRESSED by that rich lather and I got a great shave with it. The lather was so good my boar brush felt different. So fucking smooth brush/lather combo. Well done CF, well done.\n\nPS: I've read that CF soaps don't have lanolin, how does that affect the soap?\n\nHappy Sunday!",

The feel is awesome but it doesn't have the same backbone as the boar, which is ok. It doesn't have a problem creating and spreading a lather like my boar did. All in all I am very pleased with my new brush.\n\nAs for me, I've just been busy with side projects for the house and picked up the hobby of soap making. For now I'm just sticking with bath soaps before I move on to trying shave soap. Once I'm comfortable with the recipe, I'll try and PIF some for people to try.\n\nHappy Sunday Everyone!",

I hate how it smells on the puck, it annoyed the crap outta me the first time I used it, and I grudgingly found it just barely tolerable this time. Normally I like citrus, oakmoss, lavender, and sandalwood... maybe some secret rose and sage (I think they're there, but they're not listed in the marketing materials)... but there's something about the way they're blended and balanced in this fragrance that I don't like, and it's the same scent sensation that bothers me on Fern and Cologne Russe too. All three of them really irritate my nose right off the puck until they're lathered up and in use, and I have yet to experience the same specific note with any other soap I've sampled from other brands.\n\nAnyway, this ends my journey re-visting my Barrister & Man samples. Time to re-visit some of my other Maggard samples next to give everything a fair chance / a second / third opinion, and then I'll be moving on to the hefty stack of scents generously gifted to me by /u/RuggerRigger , all of which seem quite promising.",

It's nice to be able to look forward to shaving in the mornings now. The Voskhod blade performed well again and is in play for being my blade of choice. Looking forward to trying the Polisilver and Personna again as they were my two favorites initially.\n\nWhat to say about the soap, everyone knows how great it is. I really enjoy the Aventus dupes but this may be favorite scent of the soaps I currently have. It's so damn good.",

In a couple hours, the wife and I will be heading out to go see Avengers Endgame in 4D (she thinks the 4D theater, where the seats move and they blow wind and water in your face, is deeply entertaining). Then, about the time we're walking out of the theater, the new episode of Game of Thrones will drop (and so, presumably, will many of the characters). It reminds me of the old joke... \"George RR Martin, Joss Whedon, and Steven Moffat (though I suppose we could replace him with the Russo brothers) walk into a bar and everyone you've ever loved dies.\"",

NEW!)\n* Brush - Maggard 24mm Synth (Same as razor note above.)\n* Soap - Oz Shaving Co. - Winter\n* Post - Oz Shaving Co. - Winter Aftershave Splash\n* Song - [Foo Fighters - Everlong](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBG7P-K-r1Y) (GF was streaming a 90's alt channel.)\n* Coldbeer - Sierra Nevada - Hoptimum 2019 (Ok ok, it's after 12.)\n\nHappy Sunday boys!!! Look, I knew I wanted to shave this morning, and I knew it was gonna be shitty out. I'm breaking rules and using Winter, in the Spring! I have enough soaps now (nonsense, there's no such thing), where if I don't break some seasonal trends here and there, I'll never use all of em. So I said \"babe I don't care what day it is, we going Winter\" and here we are. I also just had to explain that I need new Summer stuff even tho I have Summer stuff, but it wouldn't be right to not get a new Summer set in the Spring. I have issues. Anyway, I remember the first few times I used the Oz soap, I struggled to get a great lather, and I heard other people talking about how underrated it was, so I felt like an idiot for not being able to do work. Well the last couple times I've used it, it's gotten better and better for me. It's me, not you baby.\n\nGonna run out shortly for some food, a few errands, and general Sunday afternoon shenanigans. Have a good day everyone!!!!",

WTG, XTG, and ATG clean up. A great BBS shave that I didn't expect. Last shave was a bit rough towards the end but this one was great all around. No irritation and no tugging. Excellent brush and soap. Great shave.\n\n**The Soap** worked well. Last time I used this soap, I had a sub-optimal lather with it. For some reason, it didn't lather up as much and it stayed a bit thin. This time around, the first pass lather was excellent. The second and third pass was still a bit thinner than my liking but it provided good glide. Stirling soaps are slick even with a thinner lather.\n\n**The Razor and Blade** combination worked well. A medium-high aggression shave that reduces the stubbles very well even in the first pass. It was smooth but more on the sharp side for me. The open comb definitely help expose more razor to the face. This setup is not the most comfortable but for 2+ days of beard growth, it does some magic.\n\n**The Brush** felt great. It is an opposite of a pure badger brush; it has soft tips and little backbone when it hasn't been even broken yet. It feels like a soft synthetic without the flimsy backbone. On one hand, I love this brush. But on another hand, it might be a little too soft for me. Regardless, it makes a great lather so it'll be a permanent in my rotation. Also, it looks amazing so just in terms of aesthetics, it's in my den.\n\n**The aftershave portion** was great. The alum block tightened the skin and the Stirling balm moisturized the face very well. Nothing to complain about. A lovely post shave that I can return to any day.\n\nOverall, a great shave. BBS shave that left me feeling great. Aggressive razor + blade combo but it worked well for 2+ days of growth. Soap was good but I do need to load a bit heavier next time. Brush looks amazing and performs well; does feel a bit too soft so it might be more a daily brush for less irritation. Overall, I'm satisfied with my new brush collections. I'll be on a MAY sabbatical so no more purchases! I'll be enjoying what I have already in my den.",

The Nacet was great the first 3 shaves with the 4 plate, but was tuggy on this go around. Sundrunk was thrown in to my sample order from Imaginary Authors. Notes of Neroli, Rhubarb, Honeysuckle, Rose Water, Orange Zest, & First Kiss. Bright fruity citrus opening that basically turns into orange peel. It's a nice warm weather scent, very refreshing.\n\nHearing Eruption for the first time was THE moment that started me wanting to play guitar.

Another complex, interesting scent from SW with floral notes balanced by the musk and mildew. Performance was lovely, and the small amount I took from the sample was easily enough for 3 passes.\n\nI'm going to have to do at least one more day with the Polsilver to try and reach double digits.

One blade I tried was the ultra-hyped *Feather.* It was a different experience, but I'm not interested, especially considering the price.\n\n\n*Diamond* is amazing, FYI.

Life's been busy with the new promotion and the pregnant wife but I'm gonna try to do these more often. Especially since I'm a morning shaver now with the new schedule aside from an early day or two here and there. Had a nice weekend away to the beach with the wife and did not want to go back to work today.\n\nLove contemplation and especially with things warming up that menthol is great. Can't say enough good things about the WK balm. It's pretty close to DG liniment for me, absorbs a little lighter and faster I think due to it being just a touch less thick/concentrated. It's great stuff. Also love this WR2 head. I just did a quick single Pass wtg and it's plenty close for me. I have a 0.75 Ti dual comb in order so I'm curious how different that will be with the more mild head and the lighter weight.\n\nHappy Monday folks, hope everyone has a good week!",

      "body": "Monday 4/29 SOTD\n\n* Razor: Feather AS-D2\n* Blade: Polisilver (3)\n* Brush: Elite High Mountain White 28mm fan in pecan handle\n* Soap: CL / Declaration 88 Chestnut Icarus base\n* Post: Duke Cannon Ice Cold balm\n* Frag: Lauder Devin EDC\n\nProduct Notes:\n\n* **Razor / Blade**: I've gone from loving the AS-D2 to being indifferent towards it. The difference? The new 2019 two pass BBS policy. Even with the Poli, a blade that can deliver a two pass BBS in even the ATT M1 head, the Feather razor cannot give anything more than a minimal DFS in two passes. I've tried various angles and lots of touch up, and the AS-D2 still leaves what is comparatively a lot of stubble after two passes. Feels like my old Mach 3 shaves, which of course were acceptable to me back then, but now that I am accustomed to 7 - 16 hours of glacially smooth skin with a good DE combo, this standard no longer appeals to me.\n* The AS-D2 is really nicely made - beautiful appearance and balance, fine ergonomics, great handle. And I guess I could just do a third pass if I wanted to work with it. But with a closet full of razors that can give me a quick and long lasting shave, I feel little need to accommodate the Feather. The fact that so many of these razors are also cheaper than the AS-D2 is the final insult to its injured reputation!\n* The AS-D2 has a really smooth blade feel, and can certainly be used as a daily driver by men with very light stubble (like many Japanese men for instance....hm! Geographic determinism at work in razor design mayhaps?). I prefer both the ATT M1 and the Maggard V3M head, as both of those seem more efficient and capable of reducing my moderately intense beard more reliably. And, as mentioned, if you don't mind a three pass shave, the AS-D2 is also a useful tool.\n* **Soap:** This continues to be a head-scratcher to me. It's a fine base - delivers a very efficient shave with no long lasting irritation or pain, but at the end of the shave, before the post has gone on, the old visage feels a bit sore. To me, Icarus is definitely better than the old Declaration bison, but still feels more like a solid B+ soap, a rival of Grooming Dept say, rather than an A level contender like Reserve, Excelsior, Wholly Kaw DM and / or Bufala, and Eufros. It's a good base, but does not really seem worth its cost.\n* I've seen so many trustworthy critics rave about Icarus that I've worked with it a lot, trying different loadings, different levels of brush moisture, different consistencies and appearance in the lather etc, and I keep getting very good though not excellent shaves.\n* I've experimented with the old bison base, by traveling with it to hard water locations, and it performed much better there than in my very soft water at home base. Could Icarus work the same way? Next time I travel, I'll take it along and try it out. But for now, I can't really justify using Icarus on a regular basis.\n* **The scent of the soap** may keep it in the rotation though. I am a fan of the old Fourth and Pine, the non-coniferous scent based on a St. Louis vintage cologne scent, actually a Euro cologne imported to a famous St Louis grooming shop, and 88 Chestnut corrects the address involved in the historical geographical placement but has the same complex citrus forward nature of the original iteration. (And,please note, no chestnut odor at all!) Pine / Chestnut adds some floral and herbal notes to add duration and complexity. and the resulting mix is a perfect warm weather scent. Another great collaboration between CL and DG, and these, to me, are the most appealing asset that the Icarus base has to me going forward.\n* **Brush**: A rare thing - a three band with backbone! Reminds me of the Shavemac D-01 three band design, a golden oldie from back when three bands were the only game in town for badger (back in 2014 or so). The design still has legs - softer than most two bands but great density and more than adequate backbone for most users.\n* The D-01 still exists, as both a three and now two band option from SM, but the Elite HMWs are cheaper, and, to my taste, their fan shapes are better for face lathering than either the Shavemac bulb or fan. Plus 1 of my 2 Shavemacs fell apart a year after the warranty ended, so I am not happy with the brand about that and would hesitate to recommend them for that reason - especially when there is a cheaper substitute available from Elite that performs as well or better!",

I've since moved to the UK, so it's nice to have products from home. It's really a great aftershave, very moisturizing with a perfect feel, and a nice scent too. He makes batches with seasonal scents. This spring it's a rose and peppercorn scent, very nice and refreshing. I believe they make soaps and pomades and other products too, but I never had a chance to try them. If you're ever near Provo, you should pop in and see what they have, not to mention they're the best barber I've been to.",

There's a smoothness to it that I believe is delivered by the sandalwood, and this is the first scent where I'm starting to understand the oakmoss note.\n\nIt's modern but not aquatic, but the oakmoss provides something akin to the sensation I get from some aquatics.\n\nI don't really know how to explain it, but I'm loving it.\n\nThe Talbot shaving soap base is top notch. Some say we're coming to a singularity in performance of soap bases, and if that's true I ant wait for all the future Talbot scent releases.\n\nMy daughters birthday went really well, as it was her first she didn't really know what was going on.

I've used the Derby soap stick several times in the past, and the post-shave and scent always leave something to be desired (to say the least). Nonetheless, it does allow for a surprisingly close and protective shave. If you haven't used it, it's really not awful for a stick of soap that you can pick up for 2 USD or less. It is somewhat of a negative stark contrast if you're used to using high quality artisan products, but it works in a pinch and while traveling.",

I will switch back for my shave tomorrow. I'm really trying to nail down my ideal razor/blade combo. I know I should be a little more scientific with it, but I can always look back through my SOTD for some information. I want to pick up a full container of either Rose Santal or YRP, but I just can't decide yet. Leaning towards Rose Santal, with the hope that Two Kings EdP will eventually come out. As much I as I love rose scents, I don't need to go overboard.\n\nI've been a fan of The Haunted for a long time, but their more recent acquisition of YouTube star Ola Englund on guitar has solidified their relevance. I've been watching Ola's videos for many years, mostly reviews of different tube amp heads. He doesn't vary his sound much amp to amp, but that makes it easier to tell what the tone actually is.",

Thanks to u/tha_blak_sheep for the trade.\n\nThe scent: I was very much into backpacking and the outdoors when I started my wet shaving adventure. Time and kids have kept me off the trail, but this scent takes me right back to hiking with my friends. A nice dark green scent without overpowering dirtiness.\n\nThe performance: I'm no stranger to MLS. Past favorites include Cocoa Maya, Drunken Goat, and Grand Havana. Good slickness and decent post shave feel. Not top tier for me, but a solid performer nonetheless. Happy to have this set back in my den.\n\nHappy Tuesday!",

It's a masculine scent with notes of lemon, basil and musk. It's not a million miles away from their Creed clones, so it pairs quite nicely with their GIT clone AS. Having tried most of Wickham's scents now, I think my favourites are Shamrock Tweed and Club Cola. I also just ordered their Spring Group Buy set 'Apricus' which appears to be an Eau Savage clone.\n\nI've taken the day off work to join my wife and our daughter at Baby Cinema to see Avengers.

High tide at 9:27 tonight.\n\nGreat shave this morning. Not a big fan of this scent. I mostly get funk off of the soap. The aftershave scent is great, but i was distracted by the burning sensation, It was not your normal alcohol burning either. Will try it again at some point to see if does that and is just a product of a rough shave, but I don't think so.\n\nHave a nice Tuesday everyone!",

Surprising, no? I've got some serious dry skin around my neck and on my cheekbones in places, so I decided to try using the CL salve after I put the splash on. I know how great this salve is, so I'm pretty sure this will help. And my random fragrance of the day is LGC which is delightfully springy imo. I don't use it that often and I tend to forget how uplifting the scent is.",

It just wasn't a fun shave. The scent is okay. It neither excites nor offends me. Still having trouble deciding how to describe it. Mildly floral, leathery, and hay-ish? I'm not sure.\n\nBetween the mediocre soap performance and my face being pretty irritated from wearing a dust mask all weekend working in the basement, this 6-shave old Astra didn't perform as well as I needed it to. Into the bin it goes. Might as well move on to the next blade in my box for my next shave.",

Unlike many aggressive razors, the CG L2 is at its best with really sharp blades, and the Poli is that. Great efficient BBS shave that will probably last for 12 hours or more.\n* The 100mm Torpedo is about the only long handle that I've liked in razors, and the balance and multiple locations and textures of grip points are the reason why.\n* The \"antique bronze\" finish the CG originally came with soon morphed into a weird looking piebald blotchiness that was just fugly. I took some Flitz and polished away the remaining \"antique\" finish, and now the razor gleams brightly and has not patinaed at all in the year or so since I de-antiqued it.\n* Based on that, I would not recommend the antique finish option for purchasers - looks nice for three months or so and then ends up looking nasty. Flitz and 20 minutes solved the problem, and CG warns that this will happen unless you coat the finish with another sealant, so not a complaint about the brand at all.\n* **Brush**: The Shavemac That Lived. I had this and a 26mm Silvertip bought in the same year from that brand and the bigger, costlier ST fan destructed in its fourth year of use - just big clumps of hair coming out with every use. The cheaper D01 is still just fine entering year six, and the unusual combo of a three band with extra backbone is fun to use due to the hybrid bulb / fan shape.\n* Shavemac is no longer quite the icon that it used to be back in 2014 with competition from many other small brushmakers of comparable quality that offer pricing ranging from cheaper to costlier , and I personally would not buy another, but this D01 is a nice representative of what the brand could do when all cylinders fired in sequence.",

The lather was very slick, and I had a really great shave today with it. The splash is heavier on the rose, and it's managed to linger now for a few hours. I'm really glad to have this in my rotation, and I think that it will see heavy rotation in the spring and summer. It's really great stuff! Thanks again to /u/Oleosoapworks for making this happen.",

I can tell that it has a small blade gap while shaving, but I can also feel the blade much more than other razors that are considered mild such as the Gillette Tech. This is not a bad thing to me as I prefer a bit of blade feel and the resulting shave is very close after my usual two passes. The standard V3 feels milder to me oddly enough, but not as efficient. All in all, I'm glad I bought it and it will be staying in my rotation. It looks fantastic as well with the gray finish along with the MR14 handle.",

But my nose wanted that sweet woodiness, and since many folks are Proraso fans, I thought I'd bring it out.\n\n#### ❧ Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Gillette - Sheraton 1938 ::: Gillette - Nacet ‹147 uses›)*\n\nnice comfy shave with barely any pulling on the first pass.\n\n#### ❧ Soap Notes\n*^(Proraso - Red)*\n\nI think, at TJ Maxx (or European) prices, it is a good buy. Some Ebay sellers right now have it for $7.50 and that seems okay. But if you don't shop around and pay $14 via some of the other ebay sellers, then you're better off getting some Stirling, IMO. Unless you just can't get enough of that sweet sandalwood of the Red, like me! :-)\n\n45 sec load + lightly wet long-bristled boar + 3 tsp water = about 4 passes of lather that was at just the right consistency for me. Though, this time I had to go back and load from the puck for several seconds to thicken up the lather.\n\nScent strength: 4-5/10. nicely available during shave.\n\nBowl - I used the XL version of this bowl:\nhttps://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3392930\n\n#### ❧ Brush Notes\n*^(Semogue - 1250 Boar‹13 uses›)*\n\nThis time the brush inadvertently soaked for 12 hours before I used it. It doesn't really need any more break-in, since it is already very comfy. However, not too many of the tips have split, so it will get even nicer in the coming months!\n\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Cut flush to where I just see the tips (above average for me)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm)\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

I've been meaning to pick up Acqua di Parma but it's a fairly expensive scent, and I've got so many fragrances already that I don't use enough. It's not like buying a soap for $15-30 and not using it, more like. $100+ investment. So, perhaps as summer approaches and the lather games commence I'll buy a bottle of ADP.\n\n**LATHER GAMES**\n\nI'm so excited for this year. Last year was the first time I participated and to be frank I wasn't able to put my best foot forward. Lots of overlapping artisan days. Perhaps a bit of additional planning and trading this year will help out!\n\n**B5**\n\nBeen using my 26mm B5 knot lately. It resides in a very comfortable to hold That Darn Rob Brush That has a blue and gold theme. I bought it because it represents my alma mater colors as well as my Bay Area Golden State Warriors!\n\nIt's my softest and most luxurious feeling knot, and my B6 is right there beside it, but it's s little smaller and slightly less soft tips (but more backbone). My preference is softer tips, but I've come to appreciate backbone a lot more.\n\nIn any case was really happy with today's shave.\n\nLook out for my lather games posts in June! I'm super excited to be able to participate again this year!",

I have used Timor blades before - did not particularly like them. I have been using some questionable(!) blades in last few weeks - Merkur, Parker, Derby, Sharp, Chinese Apache Personna - this Timor is definitely the one I least liked.\n\nIt feels tuggy from the get-go - not the 'not so sharp but skin friendly' kinda tuggy - actual tuggy. I can notice that I am putting some effort into shaving. I am curious to hear from people why they like Timor - do they enjoy the skin friendliness? Lack of glue bump? Cool logo? Apart from the scent, I don't personally value the term YMMV unless someone can quantify/qualify it. If I say I love Feather blades for being very forgiving and YMMV - please call bullcrap on that.\n\nAnyway, I still finished a full 3 pass shave - ATG was okay as well - had to do a few cleanup strokes but no irritation/cuts. I am thinking Astra Green as my next trial blade - back in the day I really hated it.",

For those of you that know me, you know I have been hunting for my first Declaration Grooming Brush for several months and I had decided that I wanted my first to be an Ivory. I had several close chances. /u/awareofthehair offered to sell me a Declaration Grooming Washington Unicorn Ivory B3 at one point and then I missed the /u/Blufury1 Franklin #12 by 15 mins. That said, I had a break a few weeks back when I sold my unused Fougere Gothique Coffet that I previously traded for from /u/thefourohfour to /u/kctrem for his Declaration B4 \"Vastness\" that I was able to then retrade through a three way trade to /u/SoullessSingularity for her Unicorn Ivory B6.\n\n​\n\nI won't lie. I was a little worried after all of this work if the brush would be worth it. Sometimes when you put so much work into something, it can fall a little flat after you get it, putting on a pedestal if you will. Thankfully those fears were unfounded. The knot was incredibly dense and thick, it sucked up lather and had plenty left after my third pass and could have done more work. The bristles were soft but still had plenty of backbone. The handle is beautiful. Call me old fashion, but I adore handles in Ivory, Butterscotch and Horn/Tortoise. I feel like shaving is such a traditional, ritualistic experience, I enjoy something classic and timeless and those handle materials are the most classic of the bunch.\n\nI won't go into Fenchurch today. I've talked about it ad nauseam before. It's excellent and if you like complex scents with a focus on tobacco and leather its a must buy. In other news, I booked my flight for the Maggards meetup last night. I am looking forward to talking face to face with some of the vendors and other participant's in our hobby. Theres' a laundry list of soaps I've wanted to try and hardware I have wanted to put hands on and this is an amazing opportunity to do so.\n\nLast but not least, I have to say, I am looking forward to the Lather Games. I think I'll be helping out /u/Itchypooter with some photos for the sponsor days. I am still drilling down on the details, but I am happy to help in any way I can. Have a good Tuesday!\n\nRobot",

It's my go to when i'm feeling under the weather, or up too early and exausted. I'm sure I could do it, because spaz, but I find it very hard to believe I could cut myself with this thing. The fact that it gives a very solid shave is the icing on the cake. The only problem with it, is it's completely uninspiring and boring, it requires almost no thought. Thus, I rarely ever use it, and haven't in months. Saw it in the cabinet today and figured i'd show it some love.",

WTG, XTG, and ATG clean ups. I love the feels of the razor but I got a slight irritation today. Brush is still very soft and comfortable to use. The cream was good but smelled a bit funny.\n\n**The Soap** worked well. It was my first time using it and I overloaded it. I had couple of passes left at the end but no biggie. The scent was medicinal and cologne-like, which is an odd combination. Not my favorite but I can work with it. As for performance, it was very slick. It has that cream-like texture which is always different from soaps. I can't describe it but it looks different and is a bit easier to wash off. Overall, a good cream that performed well.\n\n**The Razor and Blade** combination worked decently. The razor felt great on the hands but it did cause me some irritation towards the end. I really enjoy the combo but ATG was a little rough. I think the blade is towards the end of it use because it was rough without giving me the BBS. It might be the cream but it was very slick. I'll change the soap tomorrow and see if I still get irritation.\n\n**The Brush** felt great. It does feel like a floppy mop but I like that feeling. It did drip some water during lathering so I'll have to shake out a bit more next time. Still breaking it in but it's already so comfortable to use. Great brush for people who want soft boars without much backbone.\n\n**The aftershave portion** was great. Alum block stung pretty bad because of the slight irritation. Pretty much all over mustache and chin/neck area. Visually, my face was doing fine but it stung with the alum. The Ice cold balm cooled down the skin and I was good to go after that.\n\nOverall, a good shave. The Astra Blue blade might be end of its use so I'll test it out one more time tomorrow. If I get irritation again, I'll change it out to a Shark SS that I have and try the razor again. But other than that, I liked the set-up. The Omega Shaving cream is not my favorite but I can definitely keep it in my rotation. I might sell it in the future because of the smell but it performs well enough for me.",
