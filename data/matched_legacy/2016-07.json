Smell is very good; a dark, earthy cocoa with a bit of green/herbal notes in the background. Not sweet/gourmand by any means. Performance was excellent as well. Quickly built up a nice velvety leather with lots of slickness/protection, something which usually takes more effort with my hard tap water. A bit on the expensive side, but worth taking the plunge if the scents/premium ingredient list appeal to you.",

So Grön Lycka made a shave soap before, which perfomed very well and had a light citrusy scent. Perhaps slightly lemongrass? Anyway, it performed great. Since the customers wanted different scents, the artisan in question decided to give it a try and thus this monday three new scents were inveiled. I got the all yesterday and after a test sniff I found that the Nordic Star would suit me best today; it has a citrus and geranium scent with a hint of patchouli, very fresh. The scent stayed at a reasonable strength through the shave, not overwhelming or too weak. The performance was wonderful. The shave went well and post shave feel was great. Here, [have an ingredient list](http://i.imgur.com/ShzKKF2.jpg). First use, but it looks like I will be enjoying this one.\n\n\nOkay so the razor then: Razorock sells a cheap TTO (ten USD or so) and I figured I'd use ebay to get the prettier version of it, the Baili BD17 and give it a go. Frankly, I was surprised. It had a decent weight to it, felt solid and there was no rattling in use like with the cheaper Weishis. It have a nice shave too, mild on the face but 3 passes reduced my stubble to a DFS on the neck and a DFS+ on the face, leaving me to suspect that if I get used to it it will deliver pretty nice shaves. Since it came in a plastic case, it would do nicely as a travel razor.\n\n\nAnyone still with me at this point, have a [kitten commerical](https://youtu.be/dl9_LtwZfcg) as a reward.",

I did a test lather last night that made me positively giddy for my shave today. The lather takes on a ton of water and even when it gets really saturated, it stays viscous and doesn't begin to break down at all. That seemed to allow for optimal slickness without making a mess. The scent strength isn't the strongest, but it's a rich, refined scent that smells like Hallows' more buttoned up cousin. Not to say that it's terribly similar, but more of a recommended if you like type of thing. The ginger and peppermint are subtle, but balance out the richness and sweetness of the cocoa and coffee masterfully.\n\nProbably would have normally gone with the Hallows aftershave (or probably even pick up the Dark aftershave), but, in the spirit of Canada, I went with Gratiot League Square. Charles Gratiot begin his career as a trader in Montreal, then moved to the St. Louis area (Cahokia, to be specific) and grew his business into what became one of the most prominent names in the Midwest at that time.",

      "body": "Received an order of a bunch of new samples from Maggard Razors yesterday, so I was pretty excited for today.\n\n* **Prep:** Hot Shower\n* **Soap:** Mickey Lee Soapworks - The Kraken\n* **Brush:** Maggard Razors - 22mm Synthetic\n* **Razor:** Fine Accoutrements - Superlite Slant\n* **Blade:** Rapira - Stainless Chrome (4)\n* **Post:** Extra Lather & Cold Water\n* **Aftershave:** Chiseled Face Groomatorium - Summer Storm - Aftershave Splash\n* **Hair:** Mickey Lee Soapworks - The Kraken - Water Based Pomade\n\nAs I mentioned on Wednesday, I was expecting an order from Maggard Razors to vary my options and thus be worthy of regular posts to the SOTD thread. Mainly, that order was made because I ran out of hair care product. I keep my hair short, but it is board straight and has a less-than-appealing look if left to its own devices. Therefore, I like to put a little unobtrusive styling product in there to bring things to some sort of order. I was previously using some random \"firm hold wax\" that I got from a Supercuts somewhere along the way. Seeing as I've been cutting my own hair for the better part of the last 4 years, I don't know how long I had used that stuff. (Note that for a good year and a half I buzzed all my hair, so that extended the life of an unused hair product.) Well, I finally got to the bottom and used the last of it.\n\nLuckily enough, as I have become a fan of wet shaving and artisan soap makers over the last year, I found that a few of them make their own hair styling products. As I had been meaning to try out some Mickey Lee Soapworks (MLS) shaving products, especially The Kraken, as it happens, MLS makes hair pomades in their matching scents.\n\nI also needed a blade bank, so I threw in some MLS and Chiseled Face Groomatorium (CF) products. Unfortunately, Maggard didn't have MLS aftershave samples, probably due to the MLS temporary supply irregularities during to the move.\n\nAt any rate, today was a good 2-pass shave. Early in the second pass, I had the razor angle dialed in to perfection on my neck. It was as if I had discovered the secret to a perfect shave. Well, we all know how that story goes. I became a little overconfident, and the razor drifted a little too far inside...and I took out a piece of my adam's apple.\n\nOh well, otherwise it was a quality shave. I'm really getting better with this little slant razor, and I like it a lot.\n\nThis was actually my first experience with an MLS soap, and my my this thing lathered up easily! The Kraken scent is good, but a little different than I was expecting. I like aquatic scents, but I may need to give it a shave or two more out of this sample to make a solid opinion. I hope I like the scent because this pomade will last me over a year.\n\nAs the pomade goes, this stuff is awesome. I don't have a lot of experience with hair styling products, but this stuff leaves my hair feeling almost natural (i.e. without product in it) while maintaining proper hold on the style. Good stuff! I opted for the water based version since I'm not looking for any waxy or \"sleek\" look, and I certainly want it to be able to easily wash out on a regular basis.\n\nThe blade was decent on the 4th use today, but I'll toss it (in the new blade bank) before next time. 1st use wasn't great, but use 2 and 3 were excellent. 4 was okay. I'll try this brand again on the next go round and see if it's the same experience.\n\nThe CF aftershave was good as well. Since I could not pair with a matching Kraken aftershave at this time, I figured the closest matches that I own are either CF Summer Storm or Aqua Velva CLassic Ice Blue. I used Aqua Velva on Wednesday, so I opted for Summer Storm. I saw another user describe it as a \"moment\" scent where it makes you feel like you're in a field during a storm with the related smell, and that pretty much sums it up for me. I picked up a sample of Summer Storm shave soap, and I'm excited to pair them up, because I like the scent at first impression.\n\nWell, I've written an intro to a book by now, so I'll end by asking if any of you have suggestions for other hair care products as I might want to vary my options in the future? (That is, if I don't choose to start buzzing my hair again.)",

For the whole month. I was traveling most of the month, much of it abroad rurally by train, and had to go TSA approved minimalist. Whenever I had wifi (which was infrequent) I would read about all your sexy shave posts and sigh. Congrats to all who participated and embraced the June challenge. I'm hoping to join you next time.\n\nOn a side note, I kept my DE razor and blades in my carry on and never had an issue. It seems as long as the blades are boxed and the razor disassembled nobody pays attention. I used an Altoid tin with a kit insert. Worked great.\n\nWhen I returned I found out one of my best buddies is now into wet shaving. (He just had his second baby and has been in new parent hibernation for a while.) I asked him what software he likes and he clearly hadn't tried much. I found out he got laid off recently and times are tough. I pared down my den and put together a box of soaps, some vintage razors, a scuttle, and some samples.\n\nShaving exile due to travel is one thing, but self sacrifice for your family is another. Hope this puts a smile on his face.",

Just sayin'.\n\nIt was nice to use a straight after a week away from it. It was the first time I used a straight on a 2 day growth. Friggin' awesome.\n\nI got home at 8:30 this morning and went to bed. I still feel tired, so I'm going back to bed. Later.",

I love the fragrance but I use the aftershave with a few other B&M products so I felt I was set. But dammit if that artwork and presentation didn't sell me. Even the threading on the soap jar feels luxury.\n\nThe Bull's Blood is really an interesting fragrance, I get a ton of spicy patchouli and rose. Not a bright floral rose, but a slightly decaying, black rose like it was just thrown on Stephanie Seymour's casket in November Rain. The animalic musk could also be giving me that impression.\n\nThere's this metallic funk that does trick your brain that there's been bull's blood added. It's really something. I think this would go well with Hallows, will save what little I have for October. I'm just getting into fragrances so if anyone would like to educate or add to my thoughts, please feel free to do so. Thanks for reading.",

It's a great summer scent that's really grown on me. Many of you know that I much preferred Solarion last year but that didn't make the cut. Having Adagio as the only option has allowed me more time with it and as with many of Will's soaps, there is so much more behind the lime and cherry front.\n\n",

I don't mean a hint... I mean, it fills the room and I smell like I've been drinking all morning. Definitely not a soap I can use on a workday... I don't work somewhere that would let me go a full day without a for cause drug test if I wore this.\n\nI'm not sure about the Single Edge. It is smooth on WTG passes, but isn't close enough of a shave for me to not do ATG... which results in some irritation on my neck. Compared to the Mongoose/AC blades or the vintage GEM razors I don't think it is worth keeping for me. I get an effortless smooth shave with both my Mongoose and my ER 1912. May give it one more go before I take advantage of the 30 day return.",

I really like the scent of this, a different take on Bay Rum, but still very distinguishable as a Bay Rum. The notes it claims are \"West Indies Bay, Black Tea, Dark Rum, Lime\" - I'm thinking maybe the tea is what gives this its unusual characteristics. Really great fragrance mixing on Dr Jon's part. The soap seems really soft though - I'm worried that means it'll finish very quickly. Lather seemed good, though I'll have to use it a few more times I think to get it as slick as I'd like.\n\nI love using this blade - my oldest one so far, it's really one of my best. I do think I perhaps need to repin it - you can see that on this side of the razor, the one washer is gone.",

I'm likely going to be picking one soap to kill and shave with it every other shave while the remaining shaves are for variety. I'll probably actually be taking a break from shaving tomorrow to let my face recoup from the lather games.\n\n7 years ago today, my grandfather lost his battle to cancer (coincidentally, it's also my uncle's and best friend from high school's birthday). He was a great guy. He was kind, compassionate, giving, and never held any ill will. He taught me (through my mom) to always give the benefit of the doubt and to forgive. If it wasn't for him, I wouldn't be here - my mom's side of the family (2 parents, 8 kids, not even including in-laws and grandchildren) escaped from Vietnam about 35-40 years ago on a fishing boat. Thanks to their sacrifices, I was able to live a comfortable life.\n\nHe was a huge influence in my life, since he took me to school and home from pre-K until 2nd grade and my family visited my grandparents every Friday (still do, most Fridays). Even now he's a major influence in my life, as I still learn life lessons from the stories my mother told me about him, plus his battle against cancer was the catalyst for me to pursue medicine in the first place. My mother, girlfriend and I will be visiting his grave today before heading down to San Jose for [banh beo](http://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/kkhvKGgT8uPB4mjXtjLfWQ/o.jpg) for an early lunch. I miss him a lot, especially since there's no one happy enough to balance out my grandmother's crankiness, haha. I'm sure she misses him the most out of all of us. Happy Saturday.\n\n\n",

It's soft, has a ton of back bone, might take some getting used to. I've had this stirling sample in my mug for a while, I want it to die already!

Injector w/Personna blade (1).*\n\n***Post-Shave:*** *Extra lather, cold water splashes, witch hazel, L'Occitane* **CADE** *After Shave Balm.*\n\n***Soundtrack:*** *Sunshine and birdsong.*\n\n\n\nMy Supply Injector showed up in Friday's mail call, and this morning was its maiden voyage. My first impressions are that this thing is legit. /u/supplyprovisionco did an excellent job on this razor.\n\nIt's (from my perspective-I don't own any other all-stainless razors) extraordinarily heavy; heavier, in fact, than I've come to prefer, but I knew it would be going in. It feels great in the hand, and I had no issues with any slippage during the shave. Its balance point is a bit lower on the handle than I'm accustomed to with injectors, but easy to find. The razor provided a very comfortable, efficient shave with the mid-level base plate and a Personna blade on its first go, against 3 days' growth (which is 1 more than what I'd normally do). I did give myself two weepers, but those were user error: I accidentally buffed with a bit too much pressure in two spots during my touch-up pass. All in all, a worthwhile purchase. I'm looking forward to playing around with the longevity of these blades and the other two base plates to see what the differences are between all of them.\n\n**CADE** is **CADE**. If you don't own it, go grab some. Your den has a giant hole in its soul where that cream/balm should be. 1000% worth its sticker price.\n\nHappy Sunday, everyone! Hope you're all having a good, long weekend.",

Last night's shave:](http://imgur.com/YQWnsmP)\n\nToday's quote:\n\"Classics are books which, the more we think we know them through hearsay, the more original, unexpected, and innovative we find them when we actually read them.\" -Italo Calvino\n\n- Prep: Bufflehead preshave soap, hot towel\n- Brush: Secret agent PK-46 (Razorock Plissoft)\n- Soap: Provence Santé Green Tea\n- Razor: Fine Superlite Slant/Maggard MR1 handle\n- Blade: Viking's Sword (polymer-coated Israeli Personna)\n- Aftershave: Chatillon Lux [Colbeck](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eC9A8wjojzY)\n\nI picked up a puck of Provence Santé at Q Bros. recently almost on a whim. Only $9 (for 3.5 oz), I knew I had heard of it as one of the many European shaving soaps that had been around since well before I started wet shaving. I figured I'd give it a shot. With the Lather Games going through June, I didn't try it until now. And let me tell you, I think it's *fantastic.*\n\nThis is not a trendy soap. It's not the newest artisan soap, It doesn't have the cachet of ass milk or SV or MdC. It certainly doesn't have the deluxe packaging of those last two. Just a hard puck in plastic wrap. But wow is it slick, one of the most persistently slick soaps I've used. I know some dislike that feeling of lather that's difficult to rinse off, but I love it, and Provence Santé definitely has that quality. Great lush post-shave feel, too. Performance-wise I'd personally put it ahead of SdM and SV (and definitely ahead of MdC, which just doesn't work with my skin)\n\nThe \"green tea\" scent doesn't have much actual green tea to it, to my nose, but it's nice. Citrus and herbal. There's one other scent, called Verlaine. I don't know what it smells like. The ingredients list includes shea butter, which is usually a good sign for me, and one out-of-the-ordinary ingredient, talc:\n\n> Potassium Palmate, Sodium Palmate, Potassium Palm Kernelate, Sodium Palm Kernelate, Glycerin, Water, Talc, Fragrance, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter) Fruit, Sodium Chloride, Titanium Dioxide, Palm Kernel Acid, Tetrasodium Etidonate, Pentasodium Pentetate.\n\nWhatever. TL;DR: it's $9 and it blew me away.",

This morning though, rather than using another Feather blade, I threw in a new Gillette Super Stainless (which I've had really good shaves with in my ATT as well as EJ89) because I had heard non-feather blades didn't work as well in that razor. Well... the Gillette did just fine. Definitely not as sharp as the feather blade, but not that far off it seemed. Went slowly and took 2 days growth off without any irritation. Granted I used 3 passes plus cleanup (did I mention earlier I made a ton of lather) but it was fun to take my time and got a nice easy safe DFS.\n\nHappy Sunday to you all... and if you're in the USA... enjoy the holiday weekend.",

The knot is as soft as the common Plisson style brush, possibly even softer, but the performance was definitely different. From first impressions, the best way I could describe the feeling of this brush is like a Semogue boar on the face with tad less splay and possibly easier lathering. The lather didn't get eaten like it commonly did with my Semogue before it was broken in.\n\nHere's how I'd best break it down right now, the Plisson style synthetic has a unique feel (somewhat springy), the Game Changer knot has a feeling similar to a softer badger brush, and this knot has a feeling similar to a boar brush, but much softer.",

I really don't like menthol, particularly in soap, but this has a very different feel from a mentholated soap. Highly recommended.\n\nFirst time using my new-to-me Bengall.

Took a few days off shaving since the end of the games, and this shave was glorious. After using the Parker for a few shaves and switching to the 7 O'clock greens, I thought I was getting used to it and getting great shaves, until I went back to the Fatboy and polsilvers. Everything just felt effortless.\n\nAfter a great secret Santa gift, a preorder for beaudelaire and more soap, I definitely need to upgrade my brush to one that eats more lather than my current synthetic go to.",

Anyway, great soap, smells great, performs great.. Great! So the brush shed like 3 hairs while loading and 2 while lathering. **To anyone who owns an envy white**: I've probably used this brush less than 2 dozen times since I've gotten it. How long did it take before yours stopped shedding? Did I get a defective knot? Honestly, if it doesn't soften up or stop shedding I'll probably sell it at a discount on s_b or send it back to /u/landlgrooming to get reknotted with something less scrubby (probably the former since I found 24mm to be too big for my liking anyway). Anyway, I only used the toner to see if it burned to see if /u/hawns needs to reduce the fragrance concentration in my next order. I can't tell if the burning was from the brush or not, but it's still a lot less burning than what I experienced with LFdL, so I'll probably be safe with 60-80%.\n\n____________\nToday we're going to my grandma's to celebrate Independence Day and I was commissioned to bake [2 fruit tarts - one apple, one peach](http://i.imgur.com/fcvoDWd.jpg) - by the mother. Hopefully they taste good because half the peaches I bought were a little underripe. Oh well, till then, I need to read some papers to prepare for my first lab meeting presentation next week :| Also, I submitted my primary app to AACOMAS (DO schools) earlier this week (still waiting on my transcript to get there) and that's another weight off my shoulders. Now it's time to wait on my last letter of recommendation and start pre-writing my supplementary essays, since I'll probably be getting 18 more than last year.\n\n\n",

The handle fits the New SC head perfectly so that's a bonus.\n\nOn the NBA side of things. I woke up to see that Kevin Durant signed with the Warriors!!! I'm so hyped for the next season and this helps ease the pain of losing in the finals. Anyways, not doing much today but staying in to study for my last exam of the CPA.\n\nHappy 4th to everyone else!",

Decided to give another go with the GEM coated steel. I had much better results with the PTFE and was wondering now that I've had a few uses on it if I went back to the coated steel if there was an improvement. Well, a bit but not as much as I hoped. the XTG felt better, but WTG was not great, going to switch up on next shave and use the PTFE to confirm before tossing the coated steel one.",

I don't get any basil out of it, however. But it's obviously there. My wife did not see the lid and did not know the scent is of limes and basil.\n\nAgrume makes great, slick lather that is quite protective. It's a great soap and I am glad I took a chance on it. Capri is the perfect splash after shaving with Agrume. Definitely time to change that blade, though.",

Performance was great, and scent was good, but now he helped me pinpoint why the scent didn't stand out to me among the other B&M main scents. I don't like tea, and this is Earl Grey tea.\n\nThe blade performed well on the 2nd use (similar to the last blade), but I was a little more aggressive on my second pass, and the alcohol in the aftershave let me know it.\n\nGoing to be a tough day at work, so I went with Lavanille for the scent today to keep me going.\n\n(Interestingly enough, in that video, Will pronounces Lavanille as \"La-von-eel\" whereas my Houston, TX accent pronounces it the same as \"Have an ill.\" Additionally, I call Cheshire, \"Chesh-ire\" which rhymes with \"Mesh Fire,\" and Will says \"Chesher.\" Accents are fun.)",

I had never used DD until today and now I wonder why I hadn't before. The performance was top-notch and I couldn't have asked for more in that category. The scent was lacking the punch that I long for, though. The Egyptian musk, orange, and sandalwood combo smelled like a subdued orange creamsicle to my nose, and a sweet one at that. Overall Ouroboros is a solid addition that leaves a little to be desired scent-wise in my mind, but it will definitely remain as a part of my den. Now I can have an entire orange scent theme for the day so that is an added bonus.",

It will be in the rotation, not just for travel.\n\nThe honeymoon with the Alumigoose is over. While it's smooth, I just can't get a close enough shave on my neck with it. I think it may be in part to how wide the head is. The neck requires multiple angles, and the wide head can easily make its way out of the effective cutting zone due to the varying contours.

Loaded like a champ, lathered great, held a ton of water, slick as hell and the post shave was awesome. I don't have a ton of experience with his vegan formula but when I did use it I really enjoyed it. Don't know wether one base is better then the other. I do know /u/whollykaw really knows how to make a damn good shave soap. I personally really enjoyed the scent. If you aren't a rose fan you probably won't. The amber and woods is there but rose is the lead. If you aren't sure about rose scented stuff this would be a very good soap to try. Aftershave was a typical alcohol and menthol base. Scent was the same. The cologne is new to me as well. Violets, Oud and powder. Smells wonderful. I'll try and do a full review of the Chypre Rose Concerto after another use.",

Shout out to /u/hawns for the bottle of Fourth and Pine for my Lather Games prize. Today is the first use of it, besides smelling it when it arrived yesterday. I can honestly say that the performance of the AS is just as good as the scent. It has a citrus note that is the right combination of sweet, but still sour. It also has this nice green undertone to it that balances it out, which is why I chose it to go with Solarion. Oh, and it is mentholated, so that kicks up the awesomeness as well.",

Sapone di Paolo is fantastic soap, and for its price very difficult to beat. *Piccante* is a great lavender-forward scent. I don't get black pepper out of it as a separate note, but the lavender is darker than I'm accustomed to, so that's probably where it's coming through for me. Regardless, it's lovely both in the tub and on the face.\n\nTwo shaves in and I can already tell that I'm going to love this Supply injector. It basically gave me a 2-pass BBS today. I needed a touch up in one spot (under the jaw) that's always tricky for me to get completely smooth because I'm a pasty slug with too many chins. I was also working on 3 days' growth again, which doesn't help. I'm tempted to swap out the base plate for the more aggressive one just to see how that is, but I also want to test the blade's longevity without changing too many variables, so it's going to need to wait.\n\nHappy Wednesday, all. Enjoy your shaves.\n",

So... I went with one of my favorites in Cella Crema da Barba. The Cella with the Carnavis & Richardson brush and my new bowl for lathering meant I got a ton of wonderful slick lather in about 30 seconds.\n\nToday was a 2-pass shave (WTG and combo X/ATG) and no touchups needed. Love the cold water shaves... they have reduced my skin irritation to almost none whatsoever... and I find them invigorating (especially in summer time).\n\nHave a great day all...",

I thought a good menthol blast might help and it did! Also: awesome performance, of course.\n\nI was a little leary to try Arctique after having finally tried Cryogen last month, but I find Arctique to be just about as much menthol as I can enjoy. Cryogen is too hardcore for me.\n\nAlso, I was excited to try the AlumiGoose on three days' growth. I've been noticing that my second pass feels sort of ineffective and was wondering whether the Goose is just not as efficient as some of my other razors. Nope, definitely not that. It mowed through that growth like nothing, and I think I've decided that the second pass only feels inefficient because the first is SO efficient. It's just so comfortable and mild-feeling that I didn't realize how much work it was doing.\n\nHell of a razor.\n\nIn other news: I have a handful of vintage brush handles en route, along with a bunch of different synth knots and most of the odds and ends I will need to refurbish them.

Decided to try my last A/S sampler after my shave since my fiancee is out of town and she is particular when it comes to my aftershaves. The Clubman Musk seemed pretty disappointing when I smelled it in the bottle but on the skin it has a nice, light scent that I really like. I think overall the Clubman Special Reserve is deserving of buying a bottle--the Musk has some similar notes to the Clubman Original that I don't entirely like.\n\nShave was pretty good. More exciting is the razors I got in the mail from /u/uhgly when I got home. Lots of nice looking SEs to try out over the coming days!",

Finally went and bought a couple trial packs from Tryablade so have 4 to choose from - started today with the GEM Carbon Steel.\n\nShave was interesting. On first pull... the blade didn't seem nearly as sharp as some of the DE blades I've used (Personna, Feather, Gillette, PolSilver) and definitely seemed \"stiffer\". It also took me a little while to figure out the proper angle to hold the razor. So Pass #1 was a \"little bit\" rough. Passes 2 and 3 went well, though I did give myself a small nick on the chin... which I think was due to angles and unfamiliarity with the razor/blade.\n\nI'm going to use this razor a few times over the next week... and see how I improve or how the other blades work.\n\nHave a great day!",

Now, I do use them much more in the colder months, but I still partake in the warmer months as well. Fantastic shave this morning with Baume.Be cream. It ranks right at the top for me, along with CADE *Rich* and Esbjerg shave creams. It is made for sensitive skin, so the scent is very mild. When it is going to hot, you certainly can't go wrong with Stirling *MITA* aftershave. Nice, cool and refreshing. I am in the middle of inventory for the quarter for the accountants.

My first impression is that I prefer the Heavy. More efficient, a closer shave, more feel of the blade on my face. Demands a bit more care but I suspect the touch required will become second nature.\n\nThe GDSOC has been losing a hair or two each shave, but this time it lost four or five. A bit worrying as it's a great brush but as long at it doesn't get worse it shouldn't be a problem for a long time. But I suspect I must have damaged the knot a bit when I was harvesting it.",

Too mild!!! It's one of those razors where it feels like there isn't a blade in it. I know some guys like this, but I don't. I prefer to feel the blade. I was able to get a great shave, given I had to do several passes and blade buff like a mad man. The good news is that the razor is so mild, I was able to do this without any irritation. I can definitely see this being used by me in cases where I had a rough shave the day before, or I have an unexpected engagement and need to shave for a second time in a day, or I just feel like having a shave where I don't feel like I shaved...it's a good razor, just one I don't see myself using as a daily driver. I think I would pick up this plate if I saw one for a good deal, maybe.",

I thought maybe face-lathering it with the new brush might get me different results, as I had some serious success with Arctique the other day. Partially, I think I'm just not loading as much as I want to. That little terra cotta tub is SO damn pretty looking, but is not the easiest to load in and I'm just so hesitant to get crazy with it because I'd hate to stain it. Silly, but it is what it is.\n\nNow, I'll say that the performance is fine. It's slick, works great. I just enjoy the experience of a thick, visually satisfying coat of soap.

We have always had polecats living inside our ceiling. We let them be because they mostly keep to themselves. They occasionally make some noise, other than that they're fine. The peace between the polecats and the humans came to an end last night when I got showered with polecat piss.\n\nI felt the piss hitting me, but I thought it was a dream so I ignored it (I take a cocktail of medication before bed so I sleep like a rock). Then the smell hit me. Rancid, warm and nauseating. I jolted awake still thinking I was dreaming, and nope I was not. There was a huge stain of piss on the bed and my stomach was covered in the filth.\n\nI was so sleepy that instead of crying or screaming like any sane person would do I started smiling like a retard. Off to the bathroom to wash myself. Spent the entire morning cleaning bed sheets and sun drying the mattress until crisp. Most of the smell is gone but I still don't feel like going to sleep tonight. And next time I see a polecat out in the garden I'm going to kill it. (Probably not, they look super cute)\n\nAnyway thanks for reading my gross story. I hope I didn't make anyone puke.",

I could really get used to these 3-day work weeks! Today's shave was terrific. Of course, the star of the show was MLS. I really, really like this scent. Didn't think I would as much as I do. Maybe because it is just like walking through a garden - fresh and green. Dusted off my bottle of *L'Orange Noir* and forgot how nice it is. I have the old style \"square shoulder\" bottle which, I believe has *more menthol* in it? Correct me if I'm wrong. I am not a menthol hound, but this has just the right amount. Great Friday shaves to all!",

I'm very impressed with the Dark. A bit more peppermint than I was expecting, not a bad thing at all. The chocolate notes seem to be more of the savory sort as opposed to the overly sweet. This one is going to get lots of use come fall. Oh yeah, excellent slickness as well. This is absolutely a top tier soap.\n\nLavanille makes me very happy. Have a great Friday!",

I have to admit, I'm pretty intimidated by it. I did make it through with only a small nick on my jaw line, so that's a plus. I don't know much about the razor. Just that it is a Wade & Butcher that my dad bought off of eBay and restored for me. I would like to know more about it, but don't even know where to start. He's currently working on a Shumate Barber I got about a week ago also.",

Other than that, it was the same exact shave setup as yesterday.\n\nBottom Line... I like it... I like it a lot. It has a better feel than the post-war techs... better balance in the hand as well as good balance of aggressiveness. I enjoyed my 2 pass shave (WTG, ATG) with some touch up. I will say I needed buffing in some areas, but that was expected. In the end a little razor burn, but probably my fault as it was day 1 with this razor.\n\nNow the question is... in a shaving locker that already has: 4 post war techs, a super-speed black beauty, Ever-Ready and GEM lather catchers, a Keen Kutter, EJ DE89, EJ DE87, Feather AS-D2, ATT (R, H, R2), Maggard V2OC, Maggard V3, 4 straights, etc... Do I need another razor?\n\n(Spoiler: I am bidding on one on Ebay)\n\nHave a great day!",

Every Christmas season, Blue Bell Ice Cream puts out a Peppermint flavor, and it's her favorite ever. (No, not Mint Chocolate Chip. Peppermint. It has little pieces of candy cane in it.)\n\nFor that reason, I knew she would love the peppermint and vanilla scent of Goldrush, and I was right. It's probably one her top 2 or 3 favorite scents that I shave with now.\n\nUnfortunately, The Holy Black does not make a matching aftershave, so I went with two extra lathers to try to maintain the soap scent. Does anyone have any good aftershave pairing suggestions?\n\nOtherwise, great shave. These Rapira blades really do great for me on shave 2 and 3, but not as great on the first shave. Does anyone else get this on their blades?",

Now I wish this was released in the new base, haha (or not discontinued in general). I went with this combo as per /u/airbornesimian's suggestion and I'll say I dig it! On another note, I just placed an order for Colbeck and a sample of Fourth and Pine splash along with my custom order of Catalan's Prairie from /u/hawns. I'm not a big fan of the darker, spicier scents like LQT or Bon Vivant (but then again I have the salves, which may smell different), but I love the brighter, citrus heavy stuff, so I'm looking forward to the splashes :) Catalan's Prairie was the first CL product that I tried and I loved the scent from the beginning, so I'm happy to finally own a full-sized bottle of it!

Second shave using this new Stirling brush and man am I happy I bought it. So worth the $30.

Also still very happy with my purchase of the Rockwell a couple weeks ago. Such an awesome razor. Can't wait for the Model T next year.",

A couple little weepers and I also managed to catch the side of my nose ever so slightly with the tip. No real harm done. I have a shavette and have gotten brave with it a couple times, so I had a general idea of what I was doing. This was certainly profoundly more rewarding.\n\nI think I'll wait until my weekend to use it again so I can have a bit more stubble to shave. I'm also going to use a brush I can bowl lather with and a Glissant soap just to get my lather *exactly* how I want it.\n\nUltimately, I just had more tugging than anticipated. I think I was aiming for longer strokes than I should have been. Perhaps the AlumiGoose has been spoiling the crap out of me. Speaking of the AlumiGoose, it did a bang up job of a clean-up pass.\n\nAll in all a positive experience. Definitely another rabbit hole. I'm very curious to see how different grinds perform. I'll probably end up with at least a wedge and a really hollow grind as well. This one is half, I think, maybe quarter. I have to check.\n\nOh, and I now have my full set of Ever Ready hourglass handles for refurbishing. Will post pic later.\n\nEdit: [Vintage brush family!](http://imgur.com/EXRgrIa)",

Not good! Apparently, this Israeli blade is not matched to the Super Speed as it is to some of my other razors. I should have looked back in my SOTD's over the last year before popping in this blade to replace the lousy Shark blade.\n\nThis is the first time I have used Tuscany. I got it from a fellow Redditor in a big soap lot I purchased late-ish last year. I got good lather, but the scent just wasn't for me. It will be joining the to-be-sold pile. It must be one of the early runs with Tuscany because the label is not waterproof in the least. The label is just paper, really. I think a lot of soapers used these types of labels when they first started their businesses. I don't have any other Stirling soaps, but from what I see on their website it appears their labels are now waterproof.",

My recollection of it was that it shaves like a '40s Style SS. I'll use a '40s Style tomorrow for comparison. Regardless, it shaves pretty damn good.\n\nLast minute soap substitution. Was going to go with Reunion, but decided to use a barbershop scent for a Saturday morning.\n\nI don't usually use the same brush two days in a row unless I'm traveling. This brush is about to bump my 620 off the top spot. I think I lucked out with it when I reset the knot a tad deeper. It's perfect. It sits at ~52mm. Off onto the day I go.",

First let me say /u/landlgrooming customer service is top notch just like his products. See I ordered the 24mm brush sans knot. Me being a dumb ass didn't account for the glue knot and the fucker wouldn't fit in. I emailed Scott and within 15 minutes had a response with no less than 5 options of how to fix the issue. As you can see, he walked me through how to widen the hole and all is right with the world.\n\nYou've most likely all read /u/uselessgreggy review of the new bison soap by now. Dude was not shitting you, everything is true. Fantastic performance, easy to load even easier to lather soap goes on your face as if you were painting with whipped cream, it's thick! The post shave feel is great too. I like to see how long the post shave feeling lasts but as of right now it's top notch.\n\nSorry guys, but you need to buy this soap to see for yourself. Pick up a brush while you're at it. They are some of the funkiest handles I've ever seen!",

I cannot verify whether it does indeed smell like outer space (someone should send /u/Mark_Shuttleworth some [now there's a nice case of nominal determinism]). My wife said it smells like burnt leather and burnt motor oil. I found this \"smell of outer space\" a rather cool idea.\n\nI have to agree with /u/dendj55 's [assessement](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/4rlhyp/video_soap_review_ll_grooming_the_final_frontier/) though - there doesn't seem to be any slickness. I could get a sort of thick, sticky lather or a so-runny-it-drips-off-my-face-but-still-not-really-slick lather. Especially for a SR shave, this is non-ideal. I'm looking forward to trying the bison kidney(?) fat base one though, of which I've got a couple of samples.",

Apparently it's basically a cream, but I didn't realize when I loaded the brush. Ended up with lather for at least 6 passes. It was pretty nice stuff, maybe not mind blowing, but the scent was more powdery than I expected, which was nice. Also, having been used to heavy razors, my muscle memory really, really appreciates me throwing the Fine slant on a heavy handle. I get really great shaves from it now",

There's something about travel shaving that I haven't mastered yet. Not sure if it's because I don't know enough about the various types of water, or light conditions (it does affect me for sure), or what. Can't wait to be back home next week (this is not real vacation, but more me being recycled as a private chauffeur for my wife and daughters to enjoy their summer). In any event, hot water was scarce at the lake house, and too much laziness from me to just boil some. For the first time since I started DE shaving I had a 3-, maybe 4-day stubble and I have to admit I didn't like it. I used to be scared of shaving, so a multiple day stubble was reassuring. Now it's the opposite. Love, love, love: Bufflehead MFP (it's got to be one of the coolest names for a soap) -- duck fat!? So slick. Happy Sunday!",

Had a great shave today. I've been enjoying menthol a lot lately, so I spiked my limes and bergamot with just a touch of Cryogen. Damn that feels good. More products need to be offered with menthol in them because I can't bring myself to add menthol to something that wasn't supposed to have it. I think that L & L Grooming has the right idea by allowing you to choose the option for his aftershaves.\n\nHave a good weekend guy!!",

Really missed the M1. The Esbjerg is one of my favorites. A bit tricky to use and the CH2 Manchurian may not have been the best brush for it. It's a heavy, wet, super slick lather and the Chubby handle was hard to hold on to. I never have a hard time holding on to my Chubby ;) Not much to say about LGC. I do slightly regret trading the soap away. I at least got Lime, Lavender and Cedarwood so all in all not a bad deal. I prefer the scent of the splash anyway. Plus I'm hoping Will brings it back.",

While the margins are getting tighter and the field is getting packed with top-notch artisans, Barrister and Mann's Glissant soap base remains my personal benchmark. It hits all the right criteria for me: ease of lather, durability, water range, density and cushion, slickness, and post-shave feel. That's not to say that I haven't used other soaps that are slicker than Glissant, for instance, but Glissant manages to meet all the criteria well and consistently.\n\nIn true /u/bostonphototourist fashion, Rhapsody is a unique and complex scent. Upon lathering, I get a rather striking and robust pungent pear blossom aroma. There's no mistaking this is the foremost scent of this soap. Pear blossom is a complex scent all by itself. I have quite a bit of experience with the scent as I was surrounded by pear trees where I grew up. The scent of a pear blossom changes quite a bit over its lifetime. The early blossom is bitter and green and later, at full bloom, it evolves to the familiar pungent scent that travels on the wind quite well. As the blossom yellows and then browns, it peaks with a sickly sweet scent with acrid notes. Rhapsody seems to hit this just before the sweetness really hits. It's not all pear blossom, though. As the shave progressed, the profile got deeper and heavier with warm sandalwood and patchouli and finally a musky vanilla.\n\nThe splash starts the step-wise introduction of the aforementioned notes in just about the same order, only faster, of course. The dry-down is a pleasant pear blossom, vanilla, and musk that seem to be equally distributed. Much later, probably around 4 hours, I detect a transient peppery note before it fades.\n\nRhapsody is not your typical floral scent. It accurately captures the pungent essence of pear blossoms without being single-faceted by incorporating somewhat subtle complementary notes.\n\nBONUS PIC: http://i.imgur.com/4n3kqSH.jpg",

It was basically a try-before-you-buy thing.\n\nThe one I was most excited about was the [ER 1904](http://www.collectorsencyclopedia.com/imgins/2025B.jpg) (not my picture, BTW). It's a beautiful piece of shaving history, but I thought it would be no more than a novelty--particularly because it has no top cap, the blade is just exposed.\n\nWell how wrong I was. I just had my best shave in quite some time. Perhaps it's because the blade is exposed, I was able to get a lot of control over the angle. This resulted in a clean shave in 3 passes with no irritation. What a wonderful razor. Thanks, /u/uhgly!\n\nIt's a bit chilly and cloudy here today, so I went with the spicy summer scent of Solarion paired with what I think is one of the most A/Ses, Cologne Russe.\n\nHave a great Sunday al!",

When the 2oz tub came up on Maggards I just had to do it. The scent is interesting. It's quite nice, clean and a bit floral, and I find it actually reminds me of clean linens. Not sure why. The formula was a pleasure. Super easy to lather, nice and slick, comfortable post shave.\n\nI'd say today was day five or so in a row of face lathers with the new brush. Definitely getting more consistent results, even though I'm pulling out new soaps and just going for it.\n\nAnd I've lost track of how many shaves I have on this blade. I think this morning was probably about number ten. No pulling at all. Impressive.\n\nEdit: An update on my vintage brush project! I'll save most of the details for Tuesday, but the fourth of my ebay brush purchases showed up yesterday and I decided to see if I'd be able to just yank the knot out. Lo and behold, [success](http://m.imgur.com/a/eDo4S)! I don't think I'm going to do much to this one besides just putting in the new knot. I was strongly urged by my wife and her sister not to sand and refinish it, and I *do* really like the way the age looks.",

He hasn't been sleeping very long the past couple of nights which means I don't. He is becoming more aware and alert though which is cool. He will laugh and try to repeat sounds so I have been having fun with that. Hope it's a great day for everyone!",

This is definitely my favorite \"green\" scent in my collection. I'll be using this one more often.\n\nSo a while back NMM used his Ranger Tech and commented on how much blade feel it had. That got me thinking because my recollection was that the area get Tech and 40's Style shaved nearly identical. I used the Ranger Tech yesterday and the 40's Style today. I have to say that there may be a tad more blade feel with the Ranger Tech. Not much more, but enough to notice it. Either way, both razors are good shavers. Off to tend the smoker.",

The post shave feel is great with a lot of slickness at first and then just nice moisturized skin.

Falling back to one of my timeless classics, a Tech married to an Israeli Super+ Platinum, nearly always results in a fine shave.\n\nI freely admit, I went into this shave very prejudiced against Roam Kyovu. I used Roam just one time before and that was right after I received it in the mail at the time of B&M's scheduled release. Last time I used Roam soap and its overpowering and complimentary Kyovu I got so sick of the scent on my face as I lay in bed trying to sleep I got up and washed it all off.\n\nThis time around I used just a few drops of Roam Kyovu and not the very, very healthy splash of aftershave I normally do. That has made a HUGE difference in my perception of Roam Kyovu. While I am not crazy about the scent, it is growing on me and I don't think I'll sell it after all.",

Felt like the carbon steel blade was pulling a lot rather than slicing hairs, so I adjusted my goal to just thinning and going slowly... and it worked. First pass just got rid of most of the 3 day growth. 2nd pass was much better, 3rd pass was quite enjoyable -- smooth and easy.\n\nI ended up with an excellent shave on the day. This single edge razor does a GREAT job on my neck, which has always been problematic with the double edge razors for whatever reason. No nicks or cuts or irritation/burn so I can tell I had my technique better than the first time I used this razor. The feel of the first pass has been horrible, but I'll try it again tomorrow with the same blade - which will be the first time for only a single day's growth. After that we'll either continue a 4th day or try a different blade.\n\nHave a great day.",

I'm trying to finish off the last of the old *Clean Vetiver* sample that I have before moving onto the bottle of the new *Green Vetiver* full time. FWIW the two scents are slightly different, and I like the new one better.\n\nI spent most of yesterday in the company of a lady friend, and it was divine. We hiked around the Allegheny National Forest in northwestern PA for most of the afternoon, and then spent the evening in good conversation, drinking good beer. One of the best days I've had in literal months if not years. Today, I'm at work, writing a vendor's code for them because apparently they can't figure out how to build a goddamn ajax request to a SOAP service and parse the XML response. Ah well, at least I got a chance to forget my cares for a day or so; worth it in the long run.\n\nStone Cottage makes a great product. I really enjoy the scent of their *Vanilla and Vetiver*, because vetiver (natch), but also because it's a nice smooth vetiver blend. It's great for those times when you don't quite want to go into full-on smoky territory but still want the V. The cream's performance is very good as well.\n\nThis was the fourth shave on the Supply injector, using the medium plate. It gave me a great 3-pass shave with no discomfort whatsoever. The 3rd shave exhibited some loss in efficiency against 3 days' growth, but today's was right back to spec against 2 days' growth. Things are still looking good for this razor.\n\nHappy Monday, everyone! Enjoy your shaves and your week!\n\n\n\n---\n**ETA** Soundtrack.",

That thing is without a doubt, my new favorite non SR shaver by a huge margin, but that's a whole other topic.\n\nMost of you probably know about Barrister's Reserve at this point, but the different splashes all resurrect discontinued, abandoned, or otherwise lost fragrances. \"Classic\" happens to be a dead ringer for Gillette Sun Up which I believe was sent to an early grave in the 70's IIRC. I also have Spice, which if memory serves is based on a Shulton formula from the 1950's. The other one I have is Blue. You can probably figure out which one that is. They all smell AMAZING but it's the performance that really warrants HIGH praise with these. I'm going to stop short of saying there's magic in there or that Will made a Robert Johnson-esque deal to get this formula but it is just plain crazy good. Immediately soothing and the softness it leaves behind is incredibly long lasting. This is a luxury product through and through. If this isn't a home run, and if I may say so, a breakthrough kind of product, I don't know what is. Absolutely tremendous stuff from top to tails. Needs to be experienced to be believed.",

I'm extremely lucky to have been able to know them so well, as they're fantastic people. Much of the way I act and treat others is based off their personalities, which I believe they know. Their health is starting to be effected by their age, with my grandmother at least. She would be the first person extremely close to me that would pass in my life. Obviously there's no way to be ready, but it's going to be hard.\n\nAnyways, sorry for the morbidity, it's just something that's been on my mind.",

I use Cade Rich and Tabac more often than any of the 30+ soaps I have. If I decided to do an Austere August type of thing, I'll likely use one of these two.\n\nThis brush is big to me. My sweet spot is 21-22mm. Still, it sure is fun to have that much lather in a brush. I squeezed out the last of the lather for the fourth pass and I looked like the Arko Man.\n\nThis razor is close to needing a tune up. I may do that this weekend if time allows. Good times to all.",

This was my prize from the /u/RaggedClaws Lather Games MMXVI, generously contributed by John at LASSCo.\n\nThe performance is quite good, and the scent is phenomenal. I've long been a fan of the LASSCo Topanga Fougère, and there is some crossover here. Some of the same notes are in this scent, but it's a bit darker, smokier, woodsier. I think I could shave with it for a month and still be picking out new elements from the scent.\n\nI also noticed that LASSCo contributes some of the proceeds from Bespoke #1 to cancer charity.\n\nHappy Monday, everybody!",

In addition to having plenty of time in order to not rush, this soap was mega slick and helped me get one of the best shaves I've had in a long time. The scent was really nice, too, and a pretty good scent strength for a rose scent, as not to be overbearing. Two thumbs up",

Some of you have warned me that this might have been the harshest blade to put in this razor for a first go. Well, after shave 3... I am definitely switching and putting this blade in the workshop. The first pass is just way too rough and even today the 2nd and 3rd weren't what I had yesterday. Granted the TOBS doesn't have the slickness of the Cella I used yesterday, but this was just too rough.\n\nIn the end I got a pretty good shave but had some irritation (chalking it up to the blade at this point). Tomorrow I plan to use it again but with either the GEM Stainless Steel or the GEM PTFE coated stainless steel.\n\nHave a great day.",

I love these blades on use 2 and 3. 4 and 1 are decent, but 5 wasn't as good for me.\n\nGood shaves to all!",

Great shave overall, but I think the Polsilver is nearing the end of its life. I don't think I'll bother trying to squeeze a few more shaves out of it since I want to try out all the other blades I bought, plus 21 is damn good. Polsilvers are at the top for me right now and I'm excited to see what else there is, hopefully blades that don't need a shave to smooth out.",

The open comb makes all the difference for me. It's smooth, and cuts hair too! I was able to do a 3 pass and get a DFS! I noticed with doing so many passes with the S1 the blade longevity went out the window, although I'm not sure it's all that in the S2 either.\n\nI really like Colbeck! I didn't think I would, but I do. It's a clean scent, and nice and cool! I guess I just have horrible memories, or lack thereof, associated with gin. I don't want to go out and have a gin cocktail or anything, but this definitely softened the abrasive thoughts I had of gin in general.\n\nThis is going to be great for summer!!! Bonus for working really well with VHCS! W00t!!!\n\nHappy Tuesday everyone!",

It was very nice, and like all other Chatillon Lux aftershaves Colbeck felt great, and it is very hydrating!\n\nSpitfire is an amazing scent I absolutely love it. Performance is top-notch! All their soaps are, and I can't wait to try Albion!\n\nI wanted to try an old razor again. It was great. I finished my routine in about 10 minutes. No cuts, or weepers perfect BBS shave.\n\nHave a great Wednesday guys!",

Lux Delor de Treget Toner. Depends on how rough the shave goes.\n- Frag: Franck Olivier Black Touch\n\nBack at it today with the Artist Club. Yesterday's shave was good, a little uneven but good. I did bleed a little tiny bit and I can't remember the last time that happened. If it's a good shave I'll go with the Fine. If not I'll need something a little more nourishing. I used to really enjoy the Terre d'Hermes scent but not so much as of late. Leaves a weird taste in my mouth somehow.\n\nSo the shave went pretty well. I did a full three passes with some touch ups. No need for DE to finish the job. I was able to figure out the angles a bit this time. The razor works pretty well. I may end up buying one just for a change of pace every now and then.",

The slickness works really well with a straight.\n\nI'm digging this knot. I wish this handle would allow me to set the knot 2mm deeper. That would be perfect. I suppose I could put an o-ring at the base of the knot. I'll get another of these knots and find another vintage handle to put it in. It's too soon to call me a badger guy, but I have been enjoying them.\n\nI've been thinking about doing a \"not so Austere August\". Last year I used lower end stuff. This year I would use better stuff and only one setup for the entire month. Still undecided if I'm going to do it. Good day to all.",

I was in a bad mood this morning, so I wasn't really careful... ended up giving myself 2 nicks and 1 good cut... so that didn't make the morning any better.\n\nAnyway, good to know that there is a single edge blade out there that is much sharper and can do the work for the ER razor.",

I think I've settled on my daily driver. The iKon 102 is the most comfortable razor for me.. took me a solid 3 months of a rotation of razors. I went the Murkur 34, Maggards v3; V3a. Then with the help of some folks on W_E I pulled the trigger on the Ikon B1 slant and the 102. B1 is good for multiple day growth, 102 is the daily shaver.\n\n...enough from me.

Not the most gorgeous Manchurian knot I've seen, but the performance is there and the price is reasonable. Loads of backbone, a bit of scrub with soft tips. All good stuff.",

Why will it not?\nThen all the valleys would be pink and white,\nAnd soft to tread on. They would fall as light\nAs feathers, smelling sweet; and it would be\nLike sleeping and yet waking, all at once.\nOver the sea, Queen, where we soon shall go,\nWill it rain roses?\n...\nIt never rains roses; when we want more roses, we must plant more trees.\"\n-George Eliot\n\n---\n\n- Prep: Bufflehead preshave soap, hot towel\n- Brush: Dubya's Chubbya\n- Lather: Barrister & Mann Caledonia Rose\n- Razor: Gillette NEW, long comb\n- Blade: Rapira Swedish\n- Aftershave: Proraso Red splash\n\nFirst off, I'm going to submit one of these two photos for Barrister & Mann's discontinued product SOTD contest, but I can't decide between them. Which would you choose?\n\nWhen Will started selling Caledonia Rose, it came with a disclaimer. It did not come out the way he intended: \"The original intent behind Caledonia Rose was to produce a rose/sandalwood soap using only the necessary plant absolutes. Unfortunately, we couldn't quite get it to where we were satisfied with it. We had hoped that the scent would be stronger (though it's definitely still rosy), so we've decided to simply charge just enough to cover our investment and only produce one batch. It's a gentle, smooth rose scent with creamy sandalwood undercurrents and the same great performance as all of our vegan soaps.\"\n\nI took a chance on it anyway, and I'm so glad I did. I think the scent is fantastic, definitely strong enough to smell throughout the shave and a beautiful blend of rose with a creamy sandalwood that has an almost cinnamon-like quality, and when I say that I mean true cinnamon, not cassia. Pretty magical stuff in my opinion. My tub is getting light and I am definitely trying to make it last at this point.\n\nProraso's Red line has probably my favorite straight sandalwood scent, and I was really excited when I heard they were coming out with a splash . It is everything I hoped it would be. The scent is perfectly in line with other Proraso Red products, but in the alcohol base it just seems more... bright and alive. If that makes any sense. I suspect the alcohol level in this splash is lower than standard, as it's less bracing going on than I expected. Rubbed in really smoothly and the scent kind of oozes over you instead of punching you in the nose. Quite moisturizing for an alcohol splash, I assume owing to the shea oil. I'm probably going to buy a couple backup bottles because this stuff is the shit, going to be a go-to aftershave in cooler months for me for sure.\n\nEdit: /u/Eighchops and /u/hawns I know you were both interested to hear about this aftershave. Go get some.",

I didn't get any irritation, but it definitely didn't feel as smooth as the Polsilver.. We'll see. It could also be the envy white scrubbing my face raw as well :P So first time using this soap and so far I'm impressed. Pretty easy to get a good lather, performance works well for me and I like the scent! A nice warm, smokey sweet, pear scent that reminds me of pear desserts or pear candles. My only complaint is that it's a croap and it seems like when I load croaps, it looks like pieces are being teared out of it by the brush, even with light pressure (even with a synthetic) and that's a little annoying. I might just leave it out to cure a little more. Anyway, halfway done with the week! Happy Wednesday.\n",

      "body": "**First shave with an SR!**\n\n- **Razor:** Tosuke Wakamisori/Gold Dollar 66\n- **Brush:** Ace Synthetic 20mm (the \"Fibre\" variety)\n- **Lather:** Henri et Victoria Fall's Lumberjack\n- **Post:** Clubman Citrus Musk + homemade salve\n\nI expected to get cut at least once and I did...on my finger lol. My free (left) hand was wandering and sliced a bit of skin off my ring finger. No biggie, I've had worse.\n\nNo cuts or nicks on the face and a DFS in 2.5 passes - WTG, XTG, and ATG in a few areas where I was confident my skin wouldn't be irritated. Started off with the Tosuke but it wasn't shaving for one reason or the other even after stropping so I put it down and finished up with the Gold Dollar.\n\nSome areas feel a little \"raw\" but it's nothing I haven't experienced before with some DEs so I'm gonna chalk this one up to a lack of SR technique and experience on my part. Really looking forward to the next shave!\n\nOh yeah and I'm not a fan of the Ace Synthetic lol. Soft, but far more backbone than what I'd want. I can see some boar brush users having fun with this but I ain't one of them unfortunately. An Ace Silvertip is on its way in the mail so when it arrives I'll see if it usurps the Ace Finest.",

Shortly after, I scooped up a sampler pack of their line, which just came in the mail today.\n\nI've gotten a chance to do a test spray with each, and realized that Rhinoceros would be brutal in combination with Roam. Both have similar scent profiles, but where as Roam is very tobacco forward, Rhinoceros is heavier on the leather. In unison, they become very well balanced.\nDefinitely not a crowdpleaser though. I don't think I'd wear this combo anywhere but at home for my personal enjoyment.",

Definitely getting more used to the heft of the MR5 which was likely causing me to use too much pressure.\n\nGoing to Colorado next week, going to do some more research to see if Boulder has any shave shops otherwise I'll be using a cart (and most likely Seville, surprise). Can this week end already?",

Super quick shipping and fast order fulfillment. Amazon Prime has ruined me as far as shipping expectations, but L&L didn't disappoint...\n\nI went with the Cuir et Epices first because I pick up hints of this stuff I use on my car called Leather in a Bottle. That is the predominate smell off the puck, but once lathered I can pick up some savory spices that make you think of Fall.\n\nPerformance is good. Maybe I need to load a little heavier tomorrow, but I'm not sure I would say it is a huge step up from any of my other super moisturizing soaps. This is not a negative point in any way and I will definitely be purchasing a couple full tubs, but we tend to get really hyped about the next best thing and we are really spoiled with great artisans who are pushing the limits of shaving soaps.",

My face is a little tiny bit raw from the Feather Artist Club. The Plisson is so soft it felt pretty good plus I don't have much of this soap so to make it last so I'm keeping the badgers on the shelf. They just load so fast and seem like they barely use any soap. I guess I could weigh one then load it and weigh it again to see how much soap it holds. Do the same with a badger to compare.\n\nOn a more somber note. An old friend of mine passed away a few days ago. She was only 30 years old but heroin doesn't really give a shit about that. I knew she was in trouble for some time but I had seen her mom a couple weeks ago and she told me she was in a good place. The opiate problem in this country seems to be getting worse. Hopefully we can start treating addiction as a mental health problem instead of as a criminal act. I don't know what the answer is. Just know I have seen enough people die too young.",

I also never really do reviews on products simply because I cannot justify doing it when I feel as though there are others who do better. Today I will be breaking from that thought because of special circumstances.\n\nIn the shaving community, we are constantly on the lookout for the latest and greatest to come from artisans. Each artisan strives to be innovative and gain their niche which differs them from others. Thanks to our wonderful DNP thread, I saw the announcement for L&amp;amp;amp;amp;L Grooming's new bison kidney tallow line and knew it was something I had to try.\n\nUpon waiting for the release I was fortunate enough to be chosen for a custom brush from L&amp;amp;amp;amp;L grooming for participating in the Lather Games. This gave me the opportunity/excuse to out my order in for the soap and matching splash.\n\nAs far as the brush process goes, Scott was a pleasure to work with. I told him what I had in mind and and he told me if it was something he could make happen. I received my brush yesterday, along with the soap/splash, and couldn't be more pleased with the quality. The quality of the handle is beyond what I could have imagined. All I asked for was a combination of green and black and the shape and he could go from there. As for the knot, he recommended a 2 band finest for my needs, which I opted for in a 26mm. This knot is much larger, denser and softer than my trusty Semogue 610. My initial impression is great, and I'm sure it will only get better.\n\nI was equally impressed by the software. Having tried a sample of his vegan original formula a while back, I knew that his soap was definitely up to par, but I had always fancied myself a tallow person. Upon seeing his new formula set to be released, I knew I had to get some, knowing that it would be a good soap. I was especially intrigued by his new scent Cuir et Épices. Today was the maiden shave of this soap and damn, I am impressed. The scent is something that you really have to smell to understand. It is an exceptionally balanced scent. I believe that the name is French(?) for leather and spices(?), in which the leather is definitely what gets you first, but the spice (not being too sweet) warms up the leather. The performance is top notch. It is not a thirsty soap, but can handle plenty of water. So there is a lot room for error in making the lather. The first thing I noticed was how slick this soap was. It was slick enough to make you question whether you put the blade in your razor. Another thing that this soap excels at is post shave feel. I can honestly say that the only other soap with this post shave feel is Bufflehead, and I would have to do a side by side comparison to differentiate.\n\nYes, I know this is a wall of text, so to summarize: L&amp;amp;amp;amp;L Grooming's new formula, as well as scent is top notch. He set the bar high with it and I can't wait to see where he goes from here. His brushes are high quality as well as his customer service.\n\nKeep up the good work /u/landlgrooming !!!\n",

That said, I still prefer Polsilvers and GSBs in the slim, but that's that sampling is for. Haven't used LMR in a while, which is a shame because it's great stuff and the luxury cream performs really well. Load for 10 seconds and I already have enough lather for 3 passes. I have a dentist appointment in 20 minutes so that's fun... but the real fun part is that I have an Amazon Echo coming in today, so that'll be a blast to set up! Almost the weekend guys!\n",

I used a sample of Spitfire during the lather games and it was good but it suffered from being a sample (IE difficult to load etc). Getting my brush properly coated with some P&B and dialing in that lather, it handled my hard water perfectly. It has great post shave feeling too!\n\nThis is my first time using this toner too, Champs de Lavande has completed my conversion to lavender. I now find myself shopping around for lavender products and fougeres. In addition to my glorious tobacco scented addiction of course. I gotta land me some Spitfire to that end.",

I don't really know why. Maybe my stubble was too short. Maybe I screwed up the blade when moving it between razors. Maybe I used too much pressure; maybe it was because I didn't use pre-shave butter. But my face by the end felt like it was on fire. I ran back upstairs after about 15 minutes to put on the LPC because of its balm like qualities and its menthol. It helped a lot, which is probably why it's my favorite non-alcohol based A/S.",

Reef Point's *Aviator* is in the running for my favorite leather scent. The fact that it has vetiver in its base makes it that much better. The soap's performance is, as always, out of this world. The only issue that I had with it was that I'd forgotten that the 11047 needs a lot of product to be loaded into it in order to not run out of lather on me. I normally pair it with **CADE,** and **CADE** loads like greased lightning, so I don't have to put in any effort to get enough lather for 8 shaves. So, I had to reload for my 2nd pass. NBD.\n\nI've been reading a lot of conversation about the ASR single edge razors lately, and it's made me want to break mine out again, so I decided to give the Supply SE a break this morning and use my ER 1924. I adore how loud this thing is. It sang along with Toad this morning. I have 6 shaves on the GEM PTFE blade in it and it's just getting smoother as it goes. I got a 2-pass BBS out of it today, which is nice because when I squeezed the extra lather out at the end it was dissipating rapidly.\n\nKind of a blah day, today; not really feeling it. I'd love to go back to bed since I slept so horribly last night. Rainy days and Thursdays always get me down. Hope everyone's having a good day. Enjoy your shaves!",

They don't feel ultra sharp, and no tugging...that lends itself to a milder feel for me. I got a nice shave out of this one until the very end, the last few strokes I could tell we're about the limit. Still no real tugging, it was just at the point where I don't think I would want to get another shave out of it. I don't know the price point of these, but they could be a good candidate for the \"hit it 'n' quit it\" range for me.\n\nHope everyone's week is chugging along nicely, were almost done =)",

Love this stuff. The Stirling brush is also the real deal. Really a nice brush.\n\nGot a good shave from the SPSE heavy plate this time. Jury is still out honestly. A few more shaves at Heavy and then I'll give Mild a try.\n\nCh'lux YRP is, of course, also the real deal, but we all knew that already.\n\nI'm putting a quote at the end today since it's so long, so you can skip it if you want.\n\n\"I could see men of all colors bouncing along in the boxcar. We stood up. We laid down. We piled around on each other. We used each other for pillows. I could smell the sour and bitter sweat soaking through my own khaki shirt and britches, and the work clothes, overhauls and saggy, dirty suits of the other guys. My mouth was full of some kind of gray mineral dust that was about an inch deep all over the floor. We looked like a gang of lost corpses heading back to the boneyard. Hot in the September heat, tired, mean and mad, cussing and sweating, raving and preaching. Part of us waved our hands in the cloud of dust and hollered out to the whole crowd. Others was too weak, too sick, too hungry or too drunk even to stand up. The train was a highball and had the right of way. Our car was a rough rider, called by hoboes a 'flat wheeler.' I was riding in the tail end where I got more dust, but less heat. The wheels were clipping it off at sixty miles an hour. About all I could hear above the raving and cussing and the roar of the car was the jingle and clink on the under side every time the wheels went over a rail joint.\n\n\"I guess ten or fifteen of us guys was singing:\n\n'This train don't carry no gamblers,\n'Liars, thieves and big-shot ramblers;\n'This train is bound for glory,\n'This train!'\"\n-Woody Guthrie, who would have turned 104 today, from his memoir *Bound For Glory.*",

Very refreshing, though it still doesn't linger after the shave - but the splash is great and gives me an hour or so of that pseudo-citrus freshness.\n\nPerformance was not drastically different so far as I could tell. I actually didn't really find the soap to be any harder either. Post shave seemed noticeably better, and it may have been a tad slicker, but I hardly think fans of the original need to be lining up to get this version, unless their original tub is running low and they want to restock.",

Have to say... this blade has smoothed out since Day 1 (and I'm not doing it to hard or fast) and ... well... just a fantastic shave. Honestly, if I had tried this months ago, I might not own a bunch of razors (ok, who am I kidding, I would).\n\nThe PTFE blade in this razor is sharp enoughfor that first pass, but smooth enough for the 2nd and 3rd (if necessary). Today I got a near-BBS with only 2 passes (WTG, ATG) and some light touch up. What I also like is this razor allows me to buff certain areas that need it, and I can even shave my chin and neck safely and cleanly.\n\nI'm going to have to let some of my local friends try this out and tell me what they think.\n\nHave a great day!",

With the exception of the injector I suppose. This brush was actually terrific! I have tried a few different synthetics now and this one is neck and neck with my beloved ubersoft, I was really quite pleased with this brush. The razor left me somewhat unhappy though, I was unable to find the appropriate angle I suspect, though I really did play with the angle. No matter how I held it I felt the razor was tugging and irritating my skin, all the while not cutting hair very well. I ended up cleaning up with my slant. I was expecting to really like this razor and have left somewhat disappointed.\n\nOrange and Cedarwood was great, as I understand it this was one of Will's earlier soaps? It performs great in my hard water and the scent was wonderful. Post shave is not quite as good as white label but I would still buy a tub to be honest. L'Orange Noir was an awesome addition to this shave and I really love Fine's splashes, something about the burn+menthol+cologne type scents really gets me going. Perhaps that's why I enjoyed Colbeck so much too.\n\nI am excited to give Stirling Texas on fire a shot tomorrow, what splash I will pair with that I have no idea haha. I will probably just use Bon Vivant since I have an unused bottle of Toner that I just barely purchased staring at me. My Alumigoose gets here soon too, which is awesome.\n\nThis almost makes up for the travesty of a week I have had at work.",

I formed some Cella into a cylinder and fed it into an empty glue stick container. The only downside is the it pushes up perfectly, but there's too much friction with the sides that pulling back doesn't work; the plug separates from the glue cylinder. No problem though if I only expose as much soap as I need. Performance-wise, it worked great. Definitely a keeper.\n\nWent with the Red Tip today and got a much better shave than last time I used it. I found it overly harsh for it's efficiency last time I used it, but this old blade smoothed it out beautifully.\n\nEnjoy your weekends!",

I just got the brush (first vintage brush!) and razor from him in the mail yesterday (updated my mail call) for the summer swap and I'm speechless at the generosity by the people in this sub. I can see myself loving the NEW and will likely get it replated or Gun-Koted in the future (scared I'll react to exposed brass.. It is brass, right?). Only complaint is the blade. It seems like the Voskhods don't agree with me in the NEW since I nicked myself twice today, but I'll try again to make sure. I think I like them better in the Slim, but that's not saying much. I do have a second blade for future razors that I want to try, but I'll probably give this guy 3 more shaves then tossing it (one more in the NEW, then Maggard V3 and OC). Volunteering at the Cancer Center today, then working on secondaries for a couple hours before visiting a friend and then going to my grandma's to celebrate my niece's (technically first cousin once removed for you smartasses) birthday.

Need to remedy that. Just a great shave. One of my three favorite handles and that knot is superb. u/eighchops was wise to convince me on the ubersoft. Lots of compliments every time I use the Pantie Dropper. I'm still sad that it was discontinued, though I understand why.\n\nYesterday was our 15th wedding anniversary. I found a cool little gift that was a relic of our first date 20 years ago. Wife cried. Success! (She's not a crier.) Kids are off to summer camp for the next week on Sunday so we will celebrate a bit more then. Maybe a day trip.\n\nMy buddy wet shaver who I've been sharing software with talked to his dad about some new software we shared. His dad has been disinterested in wet shaving for years and wouldn't be convinced. Something in that box of software must have piqued his interest because now he wants to go for it. Hopefully another convert.",

There's nothing like sleeping in your own bed. It was my second go with the Alumigoose (my first SE ever), using the Kai mild (per recommendation from /u/Huckleberryking) in order to save my face from any aggression after being in the sun way too much during my out-of-town spell. These are indeed very mild, and perfect for me if BBS is not the desired outcome. In general I think the alumigoose is too light for me, so switched to a heavier handle for this second attempt. Will definitely need a few more iterations before I can fine tune the technique and make up my mind but very good first impression of the alumigoose.\n\nHappy Saturday everyone!",

Going to try it in one last razor before tossing it and moving on. Hopefully Treet will fare better. Dropping my mom off at the airport in a little bit at this ungodly hour (5:30 am right now) but it's okay. I'm going to get eggs, hashbrowns, hot links, and Swedish pancakes afterwards so it will be worth it. Also, I'm not feeling Santal Absolut, at least in the aftershave form. I like the old AOS sandalwood soap, but the Fine smells different. Does the Fine soap smell different from the aftershave?",

I went for an atg pass and got a bus, it felt smooth and irritation free during the shave. After I applied the splash the truth was revealed. My sytpic pen got some use too. I really did not apply any pressure, so perhaps my angle was off. I will continue using this though cause my face is so smooth.\n\nTexas on Fire is good stuff, I have been craving a smoky scented soap and boy does this deliver. The new Stirling formula really is the tops. Good shave overall though my face is somewhat red.\n",

This one was sharp, and smooth. 3 full passes and touch up no tugging...a DFS. I feel fully confident it will pull through again tomorrow. The downside for these blades is they have those damn wax spots on them. I scraped this blade with an old used Gem PTFE I removed from my ER 1914, these are easier to use than using a DE because they have the spine to grab. I still don't like to do it, and the wax in my razor bugs the crap out of me, so I probably won't be using these blades often.\n\nWhen I first tried the 42 splash, I loved it, but I thought I would like some menthol in it. So what did I do? I added some menthol. I really like it like this!\n\nHell yeah!\n\nHave a great weekend everyone !\n",

He's a veteran who got into wet shaving and after a while decided to make his own so I bought a couple of tins.\n\nHe describes the scent as \"bay leaf, fir needle, cedar wood, bergamot, and warm tobacco\". To my uneducated nose it reminds me of bay rum, but not. That being said, it makes for a good warm weather scent. It lathered pretty well for me, even though I didn't do a test lather. It went on slick with a good cushion, although it was a little more airy than I would've liked, but that's more than likely operator error so I'll do some test lathers to get it right. Post shave feel is excellent as it didn't dry out my face. All in all, I got a good shave from it. Also, it feels good to support local businesses.",

While applying lather for the first pass I thought the soap was no big deal. I just wasn't feeling anything other than a slight cooling sensation. But then, during the first pass, the cold really started to sink in and freeze my face. Wow! Very, very cold, indeed. CFG soaps, as always, deliver top notch performance.",

Compared to the short comb it is so much more aggressive with much more blade exposure. It FEELS like its going to slice me open at any second and a couple times it did. Crazy efficient though. Just need to be careful.\n\nAlso, haven't used any MLS butter in awhile, but there is definitely a noticeable difference in my post shave feel. My skin is much more moisturized and slick when using it.",

Don't really have anything for it, so grabbed a random one.\n\nOk, the Supply single edge just doesn't agree with me. I focused on technique more than I ever have and the ATG pass destroyed my neck. Thing is, it doesn't feel aggressive, harsh, or like I am getting irritation, but after the blade passes over it leaves a trail of irritation and cuts. Last try for me. It is a nice razor, but just isn't for me apparently.",

Anyway, first time using GTB and I can see why it's CF's best selling scent, because I'm really digging the smell. It's very unique from other barbershop scents with the leather, smoke, and gunpowder kind of anchoring the citrus notes down. Also first time using the Fourth and Pine splash. *Love* the stuff since I'm a huge citrus/eau de cologne fan. I'm going to need a bottle of this and Y/R/P when I'm done with my samples. Can't believe it's already Sunday.

It feels like plastic or something. It lathers nicely though, and performance is great, not to mention I like the Basil and bergamot scent a lot.\n\nI didn't do a full 3 pass, more like a two and a half, I left my neck to rest as I wasn't sure how well it was going to respond to the second use of that bade. The cheeks were a go and all is well there.\n\nOverall nice shave, nothing over the top, but not shabby in the least.\n\n",

It's crazy how fast the time goes.\n\n\nAfter dubyas vid I was in the mood for some fougere. It really doesn't get much better then this. The Fougere Royale is alright. Shame that it's nothing like the original. Really excited for Barrister Fern. I was wondering what he was going to replace Fougere Classique with. And I just remembered I was supposed to send this brush to someone to use. Once it is fully dry I will get it out to you.\n\nEdit: with vacation and my son's birthday I'm also missing one of my favorite shows. Nothing better then The Bouncing Souls playing in their backyard at The Stone Pony. I leave you with one of the most fun live songs ever. [OLE](https://youtu.be/YowSB2cJH1c) might be loud.",

Travel shaves are always the best and this was one of the best shaves I've had in a while; travel or otherwise. Traveling with my little dopp kit always gives me such a sense of calm and satisfaction. Excellent performance from my Tech as usual. First time using Vigoroso. I get amber and powder notes from this aftershave with a kick of menthol. The menthol glow lasted for a good thirty minutes. Smells a bit like bubble gum in a barbershop kind of way. Picked up the blades from Eddie's Sharpening right off Portage. Feels about as Canadian as you can get. You know it's a good shave when I only need to use the alum after. Wandering downtown Winni smelling like Vigoroso, and buying salt and vinegar chips and Kinder eggs for folks back in Texas puts me in a good mood. Howdy to all Canuck wetshavers!",

I've managed to get 3 on the secondary market--pretentious name and the grapefruit one being the other 2--and love the A1A. Definitely one of my top 5 soaps, if not top 3.\n\nI'm still exploring blades with the Aristocrat. It's an efficient enough shaver, but I wouldn't say it's aggressive. So far I've tried Kai, Voskhod and now Astra SP. I might have to order some GSB and PolSilver blades to try out. As it is, this is the 3rd week without my Wolfman & I'm starting to miss it.\n\nPaladin? Kicking ass for over a year. Looks great, works great.\n\nAlt Innsbruck is a great mentholated alcohol-based splash. If you don't have it or haven't tried it you're missing out.\n\nHappy Monday y'all!",

As such, I've been doing a ton of soul searching, and a bit of self-renewal if you will, lately. Although unplanned, today's shave kind of reflects that.\n\nFirst off, *Ouroboros.* Dapper Dragon ain't nothing to mess with. I'd pit /u/songwind's soaps' performance against anything else out there.^1 This stuff has so much residual slickness, you could probably just open the tub, wave it around a few inches from your face and then shave directly afterward.^2 I agree with everything that /u/uselessgreggy [said about this scent](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/4rg3il/first_impressions_dapper_dragon_ouroboros/), although the citrus that I get from it is somewhat more muted than what he reported. Still, this scent is the bees' goddamn knees, and reflecting on the soap's scent, its name and what it means has gotten me...well, reflecting.\n\nMore so than any of my other razors, when I shave with my ER 1924 I think a lot about past lives. Not in the reincarnation sense, but more the razor's provenance and my own. I don't know if it's the song the razor sings (it's gloriously loud and wonderful) or just the sheer weight of its age pressing down on my subconscious, but I always find myself ruminating about its previous owners, and what lives it saw before it got onto my face. Then, about my own past, and how I got to where I was this morning during this shave. That bit hasn't been pleasant lately, but hey, life can get ugly sometimes. The best you can do is live through it and grow. I lived through this morning's shave with another 2-pass BBS. I'm really growing to appreciate this razor.\n\nI don't have much that, on paper, seems like it would pair well with *Ouroboros,* but when I smelled it out of the tub, my first thought was *Gratiot League Square* so I went with that. The two scents work quite well together. *Gratiot League Square* is an interesting scent. Every time I use it, it teaches me something new. Today, I'm getting a lot more of the amber, leather and vanilla notes than usual a few hours after the dry down. So much so that I had to look it up to make sure those notes were actually in there, because I didn't remember amber and vanilla at all from previous wearings. I was admittedly iffy about this scent at first, but the more I use it the more it grows on me. Right now it's in the top 3 CL scents for me, maybe even at #2.\n\nAll in all, a great way to start the week. Hopefully the weekend gets here fast, because it's likely to be one for the books (more on that later). Happy shaves, ladies and gents.\n\n\n\n---\n*^1 Full Disclosure: I haven't used everything else out there, so take this for what it's worth.*\n\n*^2 Not hyperbole.^3*\n\n*^3 Just kidding; it is hyperbole. Still, Dapper Dragon ain't nothing to mess with.*",

I really liked it, it's too small to be a daily driver for me, but it's something I could see wanting to keep around. It made great lather really quickly. This soap was great too, first time using the new CB formula and while I can definitely say that the Luxury Cream formula is better, this stuff is fantastic too. The scent was good, but it was not really what I wanted out of an aquatic type scent, I think I might want something more along the lines of Trade Winds from CF. This soap smells good, it just may not be my style I guess.\n\nThe injector performed great again, this thing nicks really easily though. The splash is *awesome*, it smells fantastic, while not my absolute favorite vetiver (that honor belongs to L&L's Marshlands) it is certainly in my upper echelon of vetivers.\n\nGreat shave today, feeling good on a day off.",

I'm going to skip shaving tomorrow and then do it again on Wednesday. I think I'm going for an every other day approach starting now. Part of the problem is I find shaving so relaxing that I push myself to do it, thus causing irritation.

I've got some new \"toys\" that I had to try out...\n\nPrep: shower, hot towel on the face and proraso pre-shave cream (the first \"toy\" to try out which I loved)\n\nRazor: an unknown Shaving Factory razor (which probably will be replaced soon)\n\nBlades: Gillette 7 o'clock (the second \"toy\" to try out)\n\nBrush: a boar brush from Shaving Factory (which won't be replaced soon since I'm starting to liking it)\n\nLather: Speick Shaving Soap (the third \"toy\" to try out, btw thanx to /u/airbornesimian for the hint)\n\nPost: very cold water, bloc d'alum and an abundant amount of l'oreal post shave balm\n\nFragrance: Blood'n'Tears\n\nFinal thoughts: I'm still having a couple of issues with the right amount of pressure I'm applying with the razor but it's getting better. Differently from the first time, I've managed to cut myself a little this time so when it came to use the bloc d'alum, well... I might have said some bad words in almost every language I know. But what about the shave? Ahhhh, close and nice. I loved almost every moment of it (not the bloc d'alum though).\n\nA question: I started to try different blades (currently I'm at 2 at the moment) but I'm unable to understand how they're different. How do you feel the difference? (and it this is not the right place for this, ignore the question)",

The brush is alright so far. I know the factory starts the break in period so after 10 or so more lathers I'll decide if I'm keeping it. The handle is much bigger then I was expecting. The soap impressed. Great rose scent but that lather. Damn. No sudsy proto-lather just perfection almost right away. I did get a little burning on my upper lip area but I have gotten a lot of sun the last couple of days. I'll have to use it a few more times but I don't see it being an issue. The post is great as well. Don't need an aftershave but where is the fun in that.",

I didn't see any scents that jumped out at me at the release of the new bison base from L&L Grooming, so I got in touch with Scott and asked him to make me a custom batch of Southern Paradise in the bison base but to also add a touch of menthol.\n\nHoly cow this stuff is good! The soap is 1% menthol so it's just enough to let you know it is there. The scent is fantastic, not too much tea or too much peach. They are blended really well. With the added menthol, it reminds me of sitting on the porch at the beach sipping peach tea with a nice cool breeze blowing through.\n\nThe base itself is crazy good. I normally only do 2 passes, but figured what the hell, and did 3 passes. Only had one small nick from getting careless but an otherwise fantastic shave.\n\nThe AS was made to match and came with 1.5% menthol added. The scent was still holding strong and I was getting whiffs of it 3 hours later. The peach comes through a bit more in the AS than in the soap but it still isn't overly sweet; this AS will be in my regular rotation for quite a while. The cooling effect from the menthol is perfect for these 95 degree days with high humidity.\n\nTL;DR: The bison base is amazing! If you are on the fence about making a purchase, BUY IT! If you don't see a scent you like, but see some of his other scents that you do, send /u/landlgrooming a message about getting something made. He's a great dude and was a pleasure to work with on getting this batch made for me.",

The face feel is tremendous at the end of the shave and residual slickness between passes is some of the best I've ever experienced. Wow! Audubon smells wonderful, if a bit weak in scent strength. But no matter, performance is king here.",

When I was loading, the brush felt like it was there. Then, when I looked, it didn't look loaded at all. So I kept going for a while. That was a mistake. Eventually it got to the point where I either had to go a little dry on the first pass or ditch some lather. Went kind of dry. Left my face dripping wet between each pass and that brought it along. It never seemed like the slickest soap, but take that with a grain of salt. The face feel, however, was pretty outstanding. Luscious feeling stuff. The scent, in my mind, seemed like something that I wasn't sure if I'd dig after three passes, but it was very interesting and the sharpness never got to be too much. Very simple and nice and a great summer scent. Next time I'll just remember to take it easy on the loading.\n\nAlso, inspired by /u/tiglathpilesar, I decided to mess with some new blades. I got a really great shave from the Feather, and I hesitate to even say this, but three pretty decent nicks. I always figured it was a myth, and perhaps it had something to do with my underwatered lather, but I can't remember the last time I bled so much. Going to pop it into a different razor tomorrow, but my first instinct was to run crying back to my dear Swedes, apologizing for my wandering eye.",

I finally own some good hardware of my own! You cannot go wrong with Cade either. My mother and sister purchased this tub for me when they were on vacation, of all the souvenirs I have received this one is the tops haha. Fougere Classique is awesome stuff, it really reminds me of Pinaud Clubman, just a lot nicer.\n\nI am going to start working through this blade sampler, which will likely take several weeks I imagine, given these blades last a while. Still it's exciting to try new things.",

Thanks to /u/Angry_Cardboard_Box, I'm probably going to be buying those Polsilver blades on the cheap next month. In the meantime, I'll probably just try these new blades in the NEW and Slim, *maybe* the Maggard V3 too, but I have quite a few to cycle through and I think I have 2 of each blade which can be saved for later anyway. Cheshire used to be my favorite scent, but I'm not so sure anymore. It is still up there though and I want to get through this tub before the glissant based one gets released.. But I still have the old-old one in the tin from /u/drivenlegend too. Maybe they'll be PIF'd or something \\o/ Also, I'm surprised my face survived 2 consecutive envy white shaved. On another note, I finished 3 secondaries yesterday and I'm hoping to do the same today..",

Decided to switch up soap as I will be bringing Seville with me in efforts to further put a dent in it. LMR is such good stuff, it would definitely get a high up spot in the rotation if I wasn't focused on a single tub at the moment.\n\nBic sensitives and Seville with a Maggard's synthetic is gonna be the setup for the next 5 days or so. I'll probably keep posting so that I can keep track when I get back of my Seville usage. Always curious how many shaves it will take me to kill a tub, I didn't track many of them when I finished a TOBS and that's also a cream so it varies based on how much I scooped.",

The scent is described as \"traditional barbershop scent with notes of talc, sandalwood, patchouli, and spices\". I would say the talc and patchouli are the stars here. It loaded easily and it kind of exploded into the brush after a little bit into a nice creamy lather. Going on it felt slick, had plenty of cushion and the scent was clean and powdery. The shave went great for two passes, WTG and XTG. I went to lather a third pass when my two and a half year old daughter announced that she needed a diaper change and, well, thus ended my shave. When I was able to return after around twenty minutes, there was still loads of lather in the brush.\n\nI will definitely get more of this guy's soaps as they perform well and the scents are fantastic. Plus, there's the added benefit of supporting a local business. In my conversation with the guy, he said there's a guy that makes custom brush handles. I'm hoping to get more information on that the next time I see him.",

It honestly doesn't feel that much different from my old 1951 super speed or the 40s style super speed. It just feels a lot heavier than the other 2. Provided a great shave!\n\nThis razor was in really rough shape when I bought it. On one side it was covered with this calcified green stuff and it left some scars after I cleaned it. The other half is perfect therefore I shall call it the Two Face haha. I'll be getting it replated in thd future.",

I remember when I first used it, I loved it, but I couldn't detect the gunpowder. I decided it's because I'm noseblind to gunpowder due to my almost constant exposure to it. However, for the last few times I've used it, I do detect faint gunpowder. I suspect it's because the soap's had a year to mature and maybe the melon and honeysuckle have faded just enough to let it through. The balance and vitality haven't been sacrificed, though. It may have just gotten more complex. I really, REALLY, like this soap.\n\nAn interesting aspect to Dapper Dragon's tallow formula is its cushion. I don't necessarily need cushion. Slickness is more my thing. For many soaps however, you often have to choose one over the other, and tallow seems to dictate it. Just from my observation, tallow adds a bit of slickness and post-shave, but cushion is often less than that of vegan soaps. Dapper Dragon's tallow soaps have a robust cushion like a vegan soap (think LASSC) but with all the slickness and post shave of a good tallow-based product. Additionally, I wouldn't call Dapper Dragon thirsty, but it can handle quite a bit of water without losing anything.\n\nRevisiting my favorite boar knot in my new old brush has been a treat. In fact, the Dapper Dragon lather sort of got out of hand. Another advantage of being a shower shaver is that the excess lather can be liberated to the rest of my body as a bonus. I should take more care, though. I'm starting to see the bottom of my tub, and I'm saddened. Alas, \"Festival\" was apparently a one-and-done, truly limited edition, and the proprietor has indicated there are no immediate plans to revisit it. This is apparently a result of lackluster sales. So, consider this my campaign to convince /u/songwind to bring back this quintessential Summer scent!\n\nHere are my prior comments on Festival:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/wicked_edge/comments/3b49dy/sotdreview_dapper_dragon_soaps_2015_summer_ltd/\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/wicked_edge/comments/46y40l/dapper_dragon_festival_sotdreview/",

We closed down on Friday at one location and opened Monday morning at the new. And everything (from my IT perspective) worked, and that's a big deal! Now everything is getting back to routine and that's nice. Life outside work is still a bit crazy, got a CT scan today of my sinuses to see what's going on in there. Fun stuff :-( But hey it's Wednesday so it's half over!\n\n**Edit:** Realized I didn't actually talk about the shave at all lol. It was wonderful. I love this freaking brush. It's the 3 band version of the SiLVERTiP hair but it has plenty backbone and is very dense. Releases lather very well too. I think the handle shape is right up my alley as well. Santa Paula is growing on me, first time I used it I thought it a bit... bitter maybe? Not sure, there was just something there I didn't care for. The more I use it the less I notice it though, now I'm really liking it. Per usual no complaints about the Mamba, shaves great. Wish it wasn't so hot here, I'm already sweating...",

I changed out the blade from Voskhod to a gillette and i prepped better. I had an extra Conk soap i used as a pre shave in the shower. I got MUCH better results. I think finding the angle was the trick. It seems to work best at a 60 degree angle vs the 30-40 i was trying before. I'm excited now. This thing is serious; it mowed down my stubble with no remorse.\n",

I also got this frag from /u/HuckleberryKing, who is also satisfying my curiosity by loaning me a Mongoose.\n\nSo the Mongoose. Damn is that giant head unwieldy. And the stainless is hefty as fuck. Let the weight come at me a few times, resulting in a few nicks, but the rest was really smooth once I got the angle dialed in (not as shallow as I expected it to be). It's going to be interesting to see how it goes, but overall a great shave today.\n\nThe Phoenix & Beau is really nice stuff, too. Deeper and more leather-heavy than I expected, which was really nice, indeed.",

I did an experiment today with citric acid again, seeing as before when I was using it my lather making skills were so poor that I couldn't detect any major difference with and without. Today I went for a really high concentration of citric acid and noticed a world of difference, my soap was slicker, shinier, and did not dry out on my face, post shave was noticeably better too. I also got a closer shave and my razor did not have a massive amount of hard water residue on it as well. I think that I have found a suitable solution to my hard water woes, this also means I get to load my brushes less ferociously as well which is really nice, I won't have to load my harder to come by soaps for 50 seconds and chew through the tub really quickly.\n\nAll in all I am quite pleased with this revelation as it means I get to really enjoy some things that I previously did not get to.",

Excited to see how it shaves in the slim tomorrow. Schafmilch is great shit and I look forward to shaving with it each time. I decided to use the pairing I saw /u/hawns do and I like it. Then again, the soap is lightly scented so it's not like it *can't* pair with anything.\nI had the awkward realization that my Portland trip with my family was actually overlapping with my lab meeting that I'm presenting in. Sent in an e-mail last night to postpone it (and all the other meetings) back a week. Thankfully the lab's real chill and even in the schedule the fact that shit happens exists is comforting. I still feel bad though, but I'm sure most of us don't even like going to lab meeting either \\o/\n\nEdit: Super Stainless -> Swedish Supersteel. Had to confirm my tryablade order there since I actually didn't remember which I ordered. Kinda confusing that they both say the same thing at the bottom.",

The angle of attack is a little narrower than Wolfman, but I think it may be a little closer. I found the angle after just a few quick strokes. Also, coming from an OC preference, the safety bar is of no concern whatsoever. Man, was that nice!\n\nNuávia Blu scent sort of reminds me of, maybe like Floid Blu LIGHT, if there was such a thing heh. If you haven't tried a Nuávia yet, you should. The performance is superb. It lathers nice and quick, is super slick, and the post shave feel is amazing. I don't even feel like I need to use a post shave product with it, but I usually do because I want to =P\n\nThis Derby is pretty nice! The bottle is awkward to use, there isn't a flow restricter in it, and it has a wide mouth on it, so it's tricky to get a small amount without spilling it everywhere. I just covered the mouth with the palm of my hand and splashed upward to get some on my palm. That worked, but a flow restricter would be a great upgrade from its current state.\nIt's got a mild bourbon scent, a little on the sweet side, with a little something extra to brighten things up a bit. I also think I smell the tiniest hint of bay in the back somewhere, although that could be me misinterpreting something. It has a nice feel, no burning for me, feels like it has good moisturizing properties, and a nice light face feel. Great stuff!!!\n\nOverall today was a DFS!!! I couldn't hope for more!\n\nHappy hump day everyone!",

Like, damn, if you're on the fence about it, take the plunge. It's killer. I really didn't know exactly what to expect from the description, so I went in without any real idea of what it was going to smell like. Opened the container and was greeted immediately by the water lily and oud with the smallest discernible hint of lime. The oud is definitely secondary to the water lily, but it's still has a really strong presence and manages to be the perfect complement to the lily. The sea salt and lime really come out in the lather, but not so much that they overpower the scent of the lily.\n\nThe Scale Polish is an entirely different monster. As soon as I put it on, the oud took center stage, accompanied by that awesome touch of menthol, so it made sense to bring the whole thing together with Bodhi. Fucking hell, those two scents are a damn match made in heaven. Great shave.",

Yes, already 4 done and I can say I've learned nothing :'|.\n\n\n**Story time**\n\nConvinced that I was doing something wrong with the lather (which was not the only problem I'm having), I decided to build up the lather following step-by-step some tutorial videos.\n\nYes the lather came up different than usual. Goooood. I start shaving and, resolved to go absolutely light with my hands, I go WTG with very little results, I redo it with a little more pressure but same results. I decide to XTG with very light hand and get almost no results, redo (results: blood... kewl but still this is not the close shave I was looking for). After checking the results, I decide to do one ATG... Big Mistake! I can't keep my hand light there and I can start feeling the razor burns.\n\nA normal person would stop and re-evaluate the situation but I could still feel some patches needing some \"gentle\" touch. I finish the work with an extremely close and \"rare\" shave.\n\nI guess everybody knows that now it's the turn of my best friend (and worst enemy): the Block d'Alum. Let me tell you that it never burned so much (and for so long since it's still burning after hours from the shave).\n\nFinal thoughts: it's getting pretty clear to me that I'm getting high on Bloc d'Alum burns otherwise I couldn't explain why, instead of improving, I go in the exact opposite direction.\n\n--------\n\n**Materials**\n\nPrep: hot shower followed by Proraso Pre-Shaving cream\n\nRazor: the usual one\n\nBlade: Gillette 7 o'clock (2° shave with it)\n\nBrush: the usual one\n\nLather: Arko\n\nPost shave: Bloc d'Alum + tons of tears\n\nFinal thoughts: IT BURNS but I'll learn!\n\n---------------\n\n**Final words**\n\nSorry for the wall of text but I needed to vent.",

It was in the second or third tier of favorite scents, but everytime I smell it, I like it more.\n\nNow on to Ghost Town Barber. I picked up a sample of the soap and splash. I haven't used the soap yet, but I thought I'd use the splash today. I really don't know what to think. But that probably means I don't like it so far. Based on the description, I was expecting a \"smokey\" barbershop scent, but it smells oddly sweeter than my expectations, and not smokey at all.\n\nI checked with my wife whose olfactory senses are more tuned than mine, and when I told her I expected more \"smokiness,\" she said that it is...but it smells more like incense. No wonder it's not appealing to me at first smell. I am not a fan of incense. We'll see if it grows on me once I start using the soap in tandem with the splash.",

I switched to the regular or medium baseplate and it was perfect. Two more passes and I'm super smooth. The weight of this razor is nice and I had no problem with finding the angle. Went with the DFS today cause I'm surprising my wife with a day off with her and the little guy. DFS is her favorite of my soaps and one of mine.

Last night I showed restraint and was rewarded with a nice menthol face buzz. Wife approved too, which is always nice.",

It's definitely grown on me. Excited for Beaudelaire (and Adagio which is in the same order). The Rapira SS in the slim is great. Seems the same as the platinum lux for me, maybe a tad smoother. Also, the envy white is finally starting to feel noticeably softer. That said, I'm building the lather on my face while avoiding my upper lip, so I don't scrub that part of my face raw, haha.",

This got me thinking, and I ended up buying a full tub off Maggards when I was picking up some other stuff. I figured it won't be around much longer, so why not? I finally shaved with it today, and I'm realizing that I don't think I ever actually used the sample of this scent. I'll have to try it again, but I think it gave me some mild burning/stinging. It definitely smells like it *could* have a little dihydromyrcenol in there, which has been the culprit every other time a soap has given me that feeling. I may just try to trade it.\n\nShave was alright though. Y/R/P rocks. Alumigoose rocks. Brush rocks.\n\nIn other news, my order of fountain pens, inks, and papers should be waiting for me at work. It was one of you glorious assholes that got me to take a peak at r/fountainpens, but I don't remember who. Damn you, whoever you are.",

If you are on the fence about getting one of these do it. So far I like the Feather Pro Super's too, I look forward to working through this blade sampler, I think I am going to use 4 different blades then buy a box of whichever I like better. Then I will likely take one week out of each month to evaluate one of the other blades remaining in the pack that I got from TryABlade. It's harder to try these blades out quickly because they last so darn long haha.\n\nNow on to the shave! B&M Vanille in the Glissant base was generously provided by /u/praise_the_fireborn. I have, because of him, gotten to experience many different things which I think has contributed a lot to my ability to review things etc. This soap is terrific! The scent is literally tailor made for me, I love both vanilla and bourbon and the soap performed like a champion. I noticed that the lather experienced the same effect that Lavanille or Rhapsody have, where it literally turned brown. I would happily buy a tub and a tonique of this stuff if it were ever to be a thing. I decided to pair this with some tobacco because I have a sample of Dr. Jon's black label and I wanted to do some sampling, it turns out these pair quite well in my opinion. I do wish the splash lasted a bit longer but it lasted long enough for me. All in all great shave and I will be hunting down a tub of Vanille if there is one to be had. (for non extortionist prices of course.)",

I was completely happy with my shaves but kept wondering if I would like a slant. I finally picked one up in a trade and ordered a bulldog handle to go with. While I was at it I ordered some Cryogen because one of you genius bastard mentioned super lathering with the stuff. I knew it would be too cold for me by itself, but damn did it make the perfect soap to add a touch of cold to my other soaps. The slant gave me my first holy shit moment since I tried a Gillette NEW, and instantly made 80% of my razors obsolete. I now forgive you all for the amount of money I have spent saving money wet shaving.",

Never serious, but always a nick. I think it's because it's my lightest, smallest razor by a wide margine, and I'm accustomed to a heavier grind. The edge on this one feels so light and fine, I always seem to catch as I try to go around the chin. Oh well, that's why I own an alum block.",

Most times I just scrape some off with my digit and smooth on my face since it is so soft. It also guards against getting too much water in the soap itself. Just wondering what others do.

I wasn't sure how much I'd like it because I really got an \"oil slick\" scent from the sample. However, when lathered the leather comes out, and the juniper just peeks out to soften it out and add further sweetness. It's a really nice scent. Only complaint is that I wish it were stronger. Added just a touch of GLS because it's the only aftershave / balm I have that would pair well.\n\n/u/Huckleberryking sent me *Havana* with all the other goodies. I've been slowly working through them, and tried Havana for the first time last night. I loved it the moment I put it on and knew I had to incorporate it into my shave this morning, thus inspiring me to use Spitfire.",

      "body": "+ Soap: B&M Le Grand Chypre\n+ Razor: Aristocrat #16 (Astra SP)\n+ Brush: Fine 20mm synthetic\n+ Aftershave: Mickey Lee Bodhisattva\n+ Scent: Knize Ten\n\nIn preparation for a den clearance sale I'm going to cycle through a few of the items I don't reach for very often. LGC is one of those items. I don't know why, because the performance is great and I do like the scent. It was a good shave, so it stays.\n\nI am still cycling through blades for the Aristocrat. Voskhod is my usual go-to blade but those don't work as well with the #16. Better than Kai, but so far Astra is the best one. I just ordered some GSB and PolSilvers, neither one of which I will use with my stainless Wolfman, so hopefully those will work. Any recommendations?\n\nI remember when I was snobby about synthetics. The Fine synthetic really changed my mind on that. So easy to use and a good size even for my fat face.\n\nBodhisattva is a good scent. It's just a tad too perfumey for me--I'd like a little more incense--but I enjoy the different layers of scent and it works well. It has a really cool color reminiscent of absinthe or Chartreuse, so it's a multi-sense experience.\n\nShout out to /u/BostonPhotoTourist for featuring the Knize Ten in one of the newsletters. I admit, I only bought it because James Dean used it. (Celebrity endorsement? I'm so ashamed.) But I'm glad I did because it's my favorite scent. 'Tis a pity so few retailers carry it.\n\nHappy weekend y'all!",

I've been slacking off on secondaries the past few days.. I just have no motivation after work. Hopefully things change this weekend and I can just crank them out, especially since I'm not hanging with the girlfriend this weekend. She's got lots of family visiting the next few days haha",

It is heavier than my Slim Adjustable and the barn doors open a bit more evenly than my slim. I would say the shave compares to a slim on 4-5. Meißner Tremonia is a terrific soap. I would recommend it to anyone, plus you will not get ripped off in the scent department. Great Saturday shaves to all.",

I also like the blade way better than both in my slim, but I'm not sure if that's because I'm more used to shaving with the slim, oh well, I still got a good shave \\o/\n\nSo I'm thinking of taking advantage of the Maggard's coupon for $5 off and was considering getting a new brush. I've been looking at the Berkeley 46 in best and was wondering if anyone else has experience with this brush or Simpsons best in general? Is it worth the extra cost, or should I just go with a Frank's Finest or wait for Romera to sell knots again? Thanks!",

I had bought this soap and the lotion separately but I hadn't used them together yet. The scent from the soap was strong but not overpowering. I definitely got limes from it but not so much pomegranate, same with the lotion. My legs feel wonderful and soft now. I'm considering getting full size of both as I really liked the outcome. One bad thing is I gave myself a really good nick on my left ankle. I'm not sure what happened, maybe I just cause the corner of the blade on my skin?",

Got to try this new Lima-Especias in this crazy hot weather. Per Manuel's own description this new soap is \"menthol intense\", offered only in a small batch for the summer, and only in his Premium base. While I'm not an expert in mentholated soaps, this one definitely is intense. More than proraso green, but certainly less than B&M Arctique, Yeti Snot, and MLS Paradise Frost or Cryogen (I've only tried the first two). Despite the menthol you can still get a hint of lime in the scent, not sure about spices, though. Finishing it off with a few good splashes of Colbeck made sure I had enough menthol.\n\nOf note those Rapira blades are slowly becoming my favorite, right up there with Feather Hi-Stainless.\n\nHappy Sunday everyone.

Anyway, I guess I'm going to be deciding between Harmony and Marshlands, since I'm not sure how I'll feel about Cuir et Spices.. Maybe I'll grab a sample of it. So Harmony. I'm really digging this scent, maybe because I'm Asian and I like incense, who knows. I did notice that I liked the less-floral oriental scents, like DD Tiamat, though (sorry Rhapsody). This is a strong contender, but I'll see after I use Marshlands later this week.\n\nPut the Swede (didn't realize I didn't change the name of the blade for the past 3 shaves) back in the Slim and damn it feels way different than the first shave with it. I didn't change the setting, but this blade is *so smooth* for me in this razor. It didn't even feel like there was a blade in there at all, so I'm going to rank this higher than the Platinum Lux at least. I'll probably bump the setting up to see how far I can go with this.",

I had been having a lot of irritation lately but I've only shaved like twice in the last 7 days or so and it's helped a lot. I also remapped my grain and noticed I was off in some areas. I think redoing my grain map and being real careful to follow it helped a lot.",

I managed to cram a big ol' Virginia Sheng finest knot in it. See, what had happened was I intended to put a 22 mm VS finest knot in it, which would have been ideal, but I dropped the handle while I was removing material. The lip of the handle chipped so I had to remove *a lot* more material to remove the chip. I switched to plan B and fitted it with a 24 mm knot instead. I'm quite pleased with the result. It's not as ridiculous as I expected. Had a great 2-pass BBS shave.",

I got Arctique a few weeks ago, and since then most of the days here have been 90+ °F, so the timing couldn't have been better. Definitely the most refreshing soap that I own, always a good way to kick off the work week\n\nEdit: just finished up and wow, that little Heljestrand is fantastic, u/RocTraitor put a fantastic edge on it. Didn't expect to enjoy the weight as much as I did, but man was that clean & smooth, felt like I was shaving with a feather (a bird feather, I know what you DE'ers are thinking). I highly recommend the blade to anyone out there on the fence for switching to SR or anyone who was interested in u/RocTraitors gear in general.",

It was really a great experience. Love the razor /u/Roctraitor was such a pleasure to work with, and the razor is performing very well. I am also really liking Cheshire it is such a great scent it was decent right off the puck, but then add some water and kaboom scent comes together nicely and has the typical quality of a Barrister & Mann Soap. Also Arctique is just plain wonderful it is the aftershve that will freeze hell over.\n\n*edit- format*",

Since the Aristocrat isn't steel and since I wasn't entirely satisfied with either of my go-to blades (Voskhod, Astra SP), I thought I'd give them another chance. BBS in just 2 passes, which doesn't ever happen, so one of the best shave in recent memory.\n\nLeviathan release is looming, so I gotta get rid of the old stuff, right? Love the Leviathan.\n\nColbeck is some good stuff. As hot as it's been, a little bit o' menthol is just the ticket. The cap is a bid wonky though. The plastic regulator is a bit too large for the bottle, so when it works itself out it prevents the cap from fitting on there tightly. I think the cap might rust as well, given the reddish ring I found on my white washcloth after shaving.\n\nHave a great week everyone.",

Bigelow Premium\nRazor: Shumate's Dollar\nPost: Alum, Snake Bite\nFrag: Club de Nuit Intense Man\n\nReceived a nice one inch cut from my Shumate today. Wasn't paying enough attention. I was done with the straight after that. Finished up with my Gillette Tech and a Feather blade. I have to say that this is one of my favorite combos. Always a close, irritation free shave. Went with double menthol cream and aftershave because it's hotter'n hell here in Texas. Need to mix up a new batch of pre-shave oil. To my nose Club de Nuit Intense Man is fruity, citrus, pineapple notes on top of leather, smoke, and amber. The opening is a little harsh but give it about thirty minutes and it becomes delicious. I get twelve plus hours of longevity from this one. Such a great value.\n\nKeep a steady hand ya'll!\n\n",

Last night was my first night alone with the little guy so I had to wait until he went to sleep. Also I'm on day shift this week so my shaves will be at night. I usually start at 1:30 pm but now I have to be in at 7 am. I'm not one for getting up too early so this will be a fun week. My wife is on nights this week for the DNC in Philly so I get baby duty every night too. I'm already tired and it just started. Really looking forward to this weekend",

The razor likes to be about parallel with your face, which is different to others out there, but is super smooth. There is a pronounced safety bar feeling, but very little blade feel if held at that angle.\nThe aftershave splash left two little areas with a little sting, but I would probably go as far as to say that this is the smoothest razor I have used. You can definitely use this razor every day without worry.",

This thing is certainly aggressive. The blade has a good deal of overhang on the sides as well. I skipped yesterday to prepare myself for the Old Type. I am glad I did. I would say this shaves between an ATT H2 and a Mühle R41. Or maybe like a less refined H2. I came away unscathed except for a very minor nick on my chin that was my fault and not the razor's. A two-pass shave got me pretty much BBS. A really terrific shave. I ran alum over my face to check my work and it was pretty tame. Would I use this as a daily driver? Are you shittin' me? No way. But, I would have one for days that have more than one day of growth. Like any aggressive razor, you had better have your cup of java in ya before operating this lightweight beast.",

I decided to try something new and shave in the morning. Conclusion: I don't like shaving in the morning.\n\nBufflehead is such a great soap. As I recall, there was a hint last month about some new stuff. Anyone have word on that?\n\nGSB blades work very well in the Aristocrat. The PK-47 is a great brush, so no complaints there either.",

I really love Tobacco scented stuff as a general rule, and Havana style scents get me all hot and bothered. Speaking of which, Aramis Havana is *fantastic*, thanks for the suggestion /u/huckleberryking! This pairs incredibly well with Grand Havana, it is a strong scent and lasts a loooong time for me. Best part? I got it for like 13USD at Ross so it was a steal too.",

I'm determined to make it longer than last year, though. Might be hard with some review materials on their way here. They should make it by Thursday though, so I'll have a day or two to gather my thoughts.",

The Stallion is an oud/leather/cologne type scent to me, so it works pretty well with the soap.\n\nStill need to try some different blades in the Timeless and I need to get used to it a bit more. This razor seems to like to be damn near perpendicular to your face, but the shave speaks for itself. Smooth and very long lasting.",

It is - according to the owner - their most popular item. It's pretty good. Nice, clean scent. It lathers quickly. It's very slick on the face.\n\nThe sample puck was sort of an odd size, though. The diameter was about half that of a Stirling sample. This did make lathering a bit of a challenge.\n\nAll in all, it was a solid shave.",

They are similar, but O&C smells stronger and more like lavender to me. The Fine soap is pleasant, but more cologne like and the scent is much lighter. I do really enjoy the aftershave though, smells wonderful. I've been looking for a lavender aftershave for... well damn near as long as I've been looking for a passable pipe tobacco scent. The soap performs fine, but won't be dethroning my Black Label Lavender, AOS Tallow, or O&C (if I ever pony up the dough for more than a sample). The aftershave will do nicely until Will gets the Reserve out there though :-)\n\nCan't say enough about this brush, damn the hair is good. So soft gel tips, medium backbone, pure luxury.\n\nHappy Wednesday!",

I started soaking this well used puck of soap on Monday morning. Then there was a thread posted on W_E about WMS and Colgate. NMM chimed in about soaking a puck of WMS. This used to be the only soap I used so it was always well hydrated. It's possible to get a decent lather with it, but it still doesn't match up to most other soaps. Still, I like to use it now and then to see if I can still get it to work for me. I had to use the Jed Clammpet Hilbilly Brush with it. It just seemed appropriate.\n\nIn other news, the HVAC capital nor actor is due to fix the AC at work today. After being without it since Thursday, it's going to feel like having a new job.",

The 26mm Maggard brush is comically large to me, but its Plisson-style knot performs just as well as my other knots of that type, so it's definitely a keeper. I really like it so far.\n\nTabac is Tabac, and *Colonia Balsamica,* while not quite the best scent to pair with Tabac, is wonderful as well. The GEM PTFE blade in the 1924 is still performing like a madman. Not quite a 2-pass BBS, but it was working against 3 days' growth so no worries. My brain is still a freaking whirlwind after the weekend I had, so this is probably not exactly coherent. Have a great Wednesday everyone.",

Like yesterday in the Blue Tip, first pass was absolutely perfect, smooth and efficient. I started to notice a hint of irritation during the XTG pass, and during the ATG pass it was definitely there. I don't know if it's the Feather, or just the new blade, but I rarely get this with other blades. Now you see why I like my buttery smooth senior blades, and go as long as I can to avoid breaking in a new one.\n\nNew soap today, the limited edition Obi Hill and my first Dapper Dragon soap by /u/songwind. It stands right up there with B&M and MLS; easily just as good. The *only* untouchable US artisan for me is still /u/chiseledface, which is in Valobra and Saponificio Varesino territory. Scent on the Obi Hill is a very nice tobacco and cherry, with some other stuff. Since I've only got one real tobacco scented soap (Cognac & Cuban Cigars), and Obi Hill is a great addition.",

Really great shave. I'm thinking about trying Austere August based on one of yesterday's threads. I'm leaning towards this C&E soap as I have a lot of AS combos that would work. The soap itself is good, but the post shave is not up to par with some of my favorites.\nHappy shaves to all!",

That would be the Viking's Blade. He wanted my opinion on it so he lent it to me today to take it for a spin on tonight's shave.\n\nIs it a good razor? No. The TTO mechanism is not smooth at all. When the doors are tightened down all the way, they still rattle and there is very visible play in the doors themselves. However, to be fair, the play goes away, for the most part, once the razor is loaded with a blade.\n\nIs it a bad razor? Yes. I did shave with it, against all of my better instincts. It shaves. It's not a painful shave, actually. But the way the blade is held in the razor leads to razor burn very easily. I burned the crap out of my left cheek and the bottom part of my neck from ear to ear. Fine Clean Vetiver made sure I knew it, too.\n\nThe price of this razor on Amazon is an amazingly expensive $32 and it includes some hair-pulling blades, too. What a HUGE ripoff. Do not buy a Viking's Blade!",

Then I noticed the violet itself a little bit more. Now at the office, I'm really starting to dig it. Probably laid it on a bit thick due to allergies beginning to kick in, but fuck it.

I might as well smell good as I spend the next few hours doing last minute cramming for a 3 hour test. I am so excited to get this over with just so I can sleep again and have my life back! Too bad I have to wait a whole month for the test score.\n\nAfter using the new brush/knot, it's gotten a lot softer compared to the first shave, or I just adjusted to it. I love this brush now!",

I'm not gonna lie this both looks and performs better than any other brush I used except the 28mm Shavemac 2 band I borrowed from /u/praise_the_fireborn. It ties with that brush in my opinion. It is super soft with a perfect amount of scrub (something that I previously did not enjoy in a brush I might add), great back bone and tremendous density. I feel like I won the lottery with this thing! I'll have to upload some pics for tomorrow's SOTD so you all can see the incredible work Scott does.",

Doesn't splayed out like the Omegas. Much larger then the Semouges I tried. And the tips are a great mix of soft and scrubby. For $15 this thing can't be beat. All of you pig proponents owe it to yourself to try one.\n",

Instantly into my top 5 favorite soaps. Totally worth the trouble of getting some.\n\nThought #2: Will would be insane not to make more of this soap. I get that some people are jerks, but such is life. Given how fast it disappears on the Bazaar, how well loved it is by those who *do* like it, and how quickly it sold out when it was first released (hence why it took me forever to get some), I'd think it would be a license to print money. It's a much more wearable scent than something like Roam, so I don't think it would be targeting a niche crowd in the same way. It's quite similar to Lavanille, which is already one of the main line soaps. In any case, I'd get more during a limited release, just please let the splash be available on Canada!",

(Thanks again dude) If I hadn't already committed myself to Cade Rich for August, this would have been it. Awesome stuff.\n\nI've been watching /u/Huckleberryking's posts about his Zenith boar as well as /u/Hedgehogsinhats. I'm a dyed-in-the-wool boar fan. Eventually I'll get a Zenith. Every time I use my 610 and 620, I'm especially reminded why I like boar so much. Having stated my affinity for boar, I have to say that I have two more badger knots coming from FS. That will bring my number of badgers up to equal my number of boars.\n\nThe AC at work is functioning again. After a week of 88-90 degree temperatures at my desk, it's nice to feel comfortable again.

I went super-mild (Gillette Blue Tip), aggressive (Gillette Old Type) and something that just can't be classified (Fasan double-slant). In all three cases, I got a very close smooth shave, but detected more aftershave sting than usual. For me, this is not typical, even with a blade with 30+ shaves on it.\n\nGotta be the blade. Today, I palm stropped the blade, thinking it might have a bad edge, and went with an old reliable smoothie, the best Tech design ever made ^[1], the Canadian post-War oval-slot with the fat handle. The shave was so bad I had to stop after 2 passes. Into the bin went the blade. I've never had only 4 shaves on a blade since ... well never.\n\nI'm going to try another Feather on my next DE shave (probably Monday) since I haven't used my ER 1914 or Schick Type E2 in a few weeks. It might be the last Feather I ever use ...\n\n^[1] The post-War oval-slot Tech has the best design of any Tech because it has the most blade support - the blade is supported closer to the cutting edge than the pre-War Tech. If you're not convinced and have both razors, listen to how much quieter the oval-slot is to the triangle-slot. In all things that cut, not just shaving, a stiffer blade cuts better than a flappy one.\n\nMany people, especially on the Internet, believe the pre-War Tech is a better razor. The reality is the pre-War Tech is a better razor *for people with less than optimal technique* because it has a wider range of angles at which it cuts. If you're that person, you think the oval-slot Tech is too mild for you because you have to apply too much pressure to get a good shave, when in reality, you're just having trouble maintain the proper shaving angle. Both razors are equally efficient, but the oval-slot is smoother.",

This blade I am trying out courtesy of /u/vigilantesd is very nice, maybe not heads and shoulders above my beloved Rapira Swedes, but definitely got my attention.\n\nThe headline, however, is that like /u/crazindndude, I got my first gel-tipped brush. This Shavemac 2 Band knot is killer. Just amazing. I've tried one out before, but this one blows it out of the water. The short loft (26x48) combined with the gel tips gave my face nothing but the sweetest caress. Plus, this C&R handle is so nice in the hand.\n\nIf you are not going to shave for three days, then this is the way to do it. Now to enter my longest non-shaving stretch since I started wet shaving.

It's been a long work week where I was essentially led to fend for myself while the rest of my time was at an offsite or on PTO.\n\nPlan for today is to go for a run before showering and shaving, and since it's a Friday may log off from work a few minutes early. Was finally able to get confirmation that my Romera brush shipped and got tracking so hopefully it'll be here by next week.\n\nHave a good weekend everyone!",

I've been binge-watching lots of Traditional Shaving Evangelist on YouTube. Fun stuff. Like I've already done with CFG, I'm pretty sure I am going to have to buy nearly every single Dr. Jon's soap out there. They're just so good. I don't like that I have to order from Shave Revolution to get Propaganda. Shave Revolution **unhelpfully** does not ship to APO boxes. For the life of me I can't figure out why you'd cut yourself off from the military customer base. You know, the only customer base that by regulation *must* shave!\n\nHas anyone used Bull and Bell soaps? I saw a fellow on YouTube using it in a recent video. He seemed to like it. https://bullandbell.com/",

After some time away I find myself enjoying this knot more than I my initial impression. The knot is scrubby but backbone is medium so it's not unpleasant. Flow through is fantastic so it performs admirably not leaving me wanting more. I tend to lean towards more dense brushes with gel tips but I appreciate the qualities of this brush.\n\nThe quality of the handle is exquisite, dare I say, this might surpass the lotus for my favorite handle design ever.

This aftershave was amazing. There's no way around it. I really wanted to try my Piment de la Vie sample but I wasn't sure about what post would go with it so I raided my husband's stash. Honestly though, this is my only scent obsession. This is also the first actual aftershave that I've used on my legs. I'm not sure what I was expecting out of an aftershave versus a post shave lotion but my legs feeling nice and cool and refreshed wasn't it. I'm not sure how I'd be able to handle putting that on my face if I had to, other than it better be damn hot outside.\n\nThe Croma blade was from a sample pack that I'd gotten. I decided to switch from the Lord Super Stainless to the Croma because, I had more samples to try. I think I still prefer the Lord to these but the Croma wasn't bad at all.",

Finally, I just like it.\n\n---\n\nEdit - [Here's some gel tips for ya!](http://imgur.com/a/wfj1K) The low density of the Stirling brush vs. a Romera or Shavemac is apparent, but again, it's $30. Also the lower density comes with IMO excellent lather release - everything stays in the top 1/3 of the hairs.",

So there it was sitting on the counter when I got up today. I was very excited to use the se1 which came in Friday and boy am I glad I got this razor. This thing is very nice. I only did a two pass with some cleanup but my face is smooth. Some spots were tricky and took a little thinking to maneuver the head around but it was worth it. Awesome shave! Have a great sunday!",

It's slick once you add enough water but just doesn't seem to protect much. ATG was just rough. I ended up opting for a satisfactory shave to avoid any more irritation. First time in a long time having razor burn so the menthol in this splash was welcome. I'll give it another shot before making up my mind. The jar is super cool so maybe I'll just fill it with Cade :)\n\nHappy Sunday everyone, I'm off to the reservoir for an alcohol induced nap.",

First time trying a Feather in the Super Lite and it worked like a charm. Feathers are some of my faves. The Lucky Tiger and Tabac scents are both kinda barbershopey. Great combo. Picked up a GEM 1912 from the ebays and some blades from the tryablades. Not sure what my Austere setup is yet. For the razor it's either the GEM or the Tech... or maybe the 40's Super Speed.

Amazing results in contrast to other attempts.\n\nLast night, my fiance and I got really drunk. This might have involved me shaving my armpits. That shave looked something like this:\n\nPrep - All the bourbon and wine.\nLather - Barrister and Mann Bay Rum (sample)\nBrush - Edwin Jagger Badger\nRazor - Merkur 34c HD\nBlade - Merkur Special\nPost - Floid splash, because I'm a mad lad.\n\n\nCould have been worse?",

Local Gent, PAA, and Wick's Brewery got together to make a special soap and aftershave for the occasion.\n\nFirstly, the soap smells like orange blossom, rose, and dirt. It made a great lather with my brush soaking wet, and went on slick with lots of cushion.\n\nSecondly, the aftershave is alcohol based and mentholated. The scent perfectly matches the soap, but kicks it up a notch. It starts off really strong with the orange blossom/dirt then settles into more of the orange blossom and rose that lasts a long time.\n\nOverall, I love the soap, but because it's a limited edition I'll probably only use it on weekends and special occasions. Because the scent profile is so specific, I'll probably do the same with the aftershave, but I'll test it with other soaps on occasion.",
