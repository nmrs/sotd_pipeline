So I used some on my damp face, but for some reason it really irritated my cheeks. So much so, that I had to wash it off almost right away. Im not sure what caused this reaction, maybe I used to much, or it somehow reacted to the pH of my skin.\n\nAnyway, after I washed it off I went ahead with my routine. I was just on the verge of over watering my lather tonight but it ended up working out.\n\nI could smell this tub of soap all night, it just an amazing scent. Every time I lather it up I can't help but take a few deep whiffs of it.\n\nToday I tried one of the bolzano supernox blades I bought. It was a great shave, but the blade itself was unremarkable. I can safely call these mediocre from tonight's experience. I surely will try them again at some point so maybe my opinion will eventually change.",

High tide at 8:00 this evening.\n\nA nice shave this morning. This scent is nice and relaxing, something perfect to start the new year with.\n\nHave a nice Tuesday everyone!",

Truthfully, I wasn't a big fan of the new Excelsior base so that would factor into an ordering decision as well.\n\nHappy 2019 guys. Anyone else have to eat pork and sauerkraut today? I'm not sure where the tradition originates but here in PA it's on most people menu. We'll be doing a pork roast in a dutch oven with sauerkraut and mashed potatoes.....YUMMY\n",

Excellent one at that!\n\nI decided to use a new razor, new brush, and new soap for the occasion.\n\n## Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Gillette - NEW Improved 1929 ::: Gillette - Silver Blue ‹19 uses›)*\n\nFirst time with this guy. The NEW Improved was touted as one of the best of the old razors by who knows who a couple of years ago when I started my wet shaving journey. May have just been some guys opinion on a board. Who knows? But that caused me to always be on the look out. And I finally snagged one!\n\nShaved so well. Had no problem hacking through my 2-day growth. Probably a little more to the side of efficient cutter than comfort, but still quite close to the middle. Very enjoyable and a close cut!\n\nAlmost no irritation and no tugging. Gillette Silver Blue was a gooooood match for me in this piece.\n\n## Soap Notes\n*^(Stirling - D-503)*\n\nLove the manly cologne-type scent on this one... patterned after Mont Blanc's Legend. Very nice. Performance was excellent as usual for Stirling. I decided that Stirling would be my first shave this year because of the company's honor and customer service, and that they make so many great scents in their high-value workhorse of a base that is just so slick. It's a delight to use and relatively inexpensive to obtain.\n\nRatio doesn't matter too much today, since I had to go back to the tub before each pass, because of the new boar I'm breaking in.\n\nScent strength: 4/10. NIcely present during shave without being too overpowering.\n\n\n## Brush Notes\n*^(Omega - 10098)*\n\nMy first brush to feel more like a broom when used! A little bit of prickle, and some flex because the loft is quite high. Looking forward to watching those tips split and get softer!\n\nI was so surprised when I got it that the handle was so large! Such a welcome change from the tiny ones that are typical.\n\n## Shave Quality\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Few hairs are showing some tip length (with most being cut flush)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm)\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

Started the second pass for the first time, and it looks like another huge hurdle to overcome. This is more challenging than I expected. Hopefully it pays off. Didn't realize how quick I'd gotten with a DE until faced with these straight razor shaves. For scale, my 1st *DE shave* took about a half hour. My 1st *first pass with a straight* took almost the same amount of time. Yikes! Steadily improving, though.\n\n\nI've always loved this song, thought I'd share it.\n\n\nHave a great day everyone!",

I've been sick with a fever since Sunday and my fever finally broke last night. I needed some extra help waking up/not feeling like a zombie this morning, and this frankenlather did the trick! The menthol level was just right and it helped clear my sinuses up as well. I never know how much of a sample to use for a shave, so I had way to much lather. I guess I'll have to use this combo again.\n\nHalf way through the week men, good luck.",

This soap is the standard against which I judge how drying soaps are. Apart from Ivory, which was my soap for decades, this soap takes the prize for being the most drying to my skin. I have said it many times before, I will never accuse this of being a good soap, but it most definitely is possible to get a close, smooth shave with it. I am further of the opinion that if you can learn to lather WMS, you can lather anything. Would I recommend it? No. But I like having it around for the nostalgia.\n\nBack to work after a long weekend.",

Warm, comforting, classic, manly. I'm more and more confident in my plan to use exclusively Reserve base items during the work week and my other software on weekends. I'm especially happy to see that Will is planning Fern and Waves EdCs in the coming months, and hopefully that expands to include Spice and Classic down the line, too. I'll be picking up a full Cool set (soap, splash, EdC) and a Waves set (soap, splash) coming up soon, and then the hunt for Seville in Reserve resumes. Hoping I can offload a few items in the mean time to offset that cost, and then I'll be set on wet shaving gear for quite awhile.\n\nUp to use number 9 on this blade and for some reason it just keeps chugging along. Back in the office today after a long break, feeling refreshed. Happy shaves all.",

I must admit, this is one of those cases that proves packaging sells. They popped up on my IG feed, and I was quite impressed with the look of the brand, particularly for someone so new. So I grabbed a few samples. The first I tired, Trinity, smells like their Aventus inspired scent, so pairing was easy. As a set slut, I tend to like to have matching aftershaves, or at least ones that pair well. This may make the next several days more challenging.\n\n​\n\nFor consistency, this is a very soft soap. Almost tube-cream soft. Even softer than FCSSC or Phoenix and Beau Denali, both of which I find quite soft. It's actually softer than XPEC, which is sold as cream. I was easily able to generate a good, stable lather. It did not require a ton of water, but did take a decent amount without breaking. Performance was good, reasonably slick, and post shave was solid, but not stellar. This is a good performing soap, but not quite top-tier stuff. I am however, impressed overall with the scents, and look forward to seeing further offerings from them, particularly if some minor tweaks are made to the base. I'll be trying 4 more scents starting this evening, and will probably write an overall first impression post once I've finished all of them (though I may plagiarize myself, as I've covered much of the basics here.",

It's been doing really well for me and I've noticed I need slightly less pressure around my chin area, so the razor has helped me improve my technique. I've never used a razor quite this aggressive and it is very comfortable for me. I get such an easy BBS and it takes away the hairs in my trouble areas much easier. Overall I'm very pleased with this purchase.\n\nStirlings boar brush isn't quite broken in all the way but I can get enough soap out of it for a 3 pass shave right now. I just put the brush in a container full of water and shoved it in my fridge to soak for a day or two. I'm excited to test out the difference a cold soak makes when breaking in a boar. I've read good things about it from several people around here. Have any of you tried it?",

My first try with LeBelle soaps and was very good. And the TDR Fanchurian's tips were finally softened by my extra long soak in warm water this time.\n\nAND... let the rejoicing begin! I finally killed my Nivea Post Shave Sensitive Balm. 119 uses out of those 3.3 oz! Boo-yah! It was my first balm. I really worked to kill it this last month because I like the one with the alcohol better. But I didn't quit it because I just had to know how many uses it was going to give me.\n\n## Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Merkur - Futur Setting 3 ::: Astra - Platinum ‹7 uses›)*\n\nThe more I use this razor, the more I like it. Which is odd because I gravitate more to the vintage and classic styles for sure. It just shaves so well. 3 is a great setting for me if I want the balance of a good cutter with some comfort. Every blade I've put in this has worked very well for me.\n\nNo tugging or irritation.\n\n## Soap Notes\n*^(LeBelle Soaps - Spike's Garden)*\n\nScent was interesting. Though not for me (due to just so many good ones out there), it was interesting to sample a scent that has florals fighting herbs. Each one does turn out to dampen what I don't like in each kind of scent, so that's cool. Herbs were the most dominant.\n\nSoap performed really well. NIce slick lather with very good protection. Slick and creamy rinses, too.\n\n30 second load with lightly-wet brush + 2.5 tsp water = plenty of lather. 2 passes too many, actually. Maybe reduce to 20 sec of loading next time.\n\nI have two other LeBelle soaps that I got in a lot. With performance like this, I'm looking forward to trying them out. Wasn't top tier, but I got a very very nice lather.\n\nScent Strength: 4-5/10. Nicely present during shave without being overbearing.\n\n\n## Brush Notes\n*^(That Darn Rob - Fanchurian 28mm 2-Band)*\n\nThe tips on this brush, during the previous 14 uses, have been not-soft. This surprises Rob. I'm hoping that more uses will soften them up. To maybe help that, I decided to try soaking the bristles (not the glue ball) in hot tap water for a while before the shave. Got occupied and it ended up to be 20 mins or so.\n\nWell, it worked. The tips were soft and the brush was a pleasure to use. I'll bet as it ages, eventually I won't have to do this kind of soak. But for now at least I have a way to get to Comfy.\n\n## Shave Quality\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Cut flush to where I just see the tips (above average for me)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm)\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

The tips are soft, and it has a bit more backbone than recent batches I think. I'm used to a Theodore handle though, and this brush is Jefferson, so I'm still evaluating.\n\nThe ATT is a very nice razor. It flies under the radar but it's well made, and smooth.

The scent is a nice fragrance, seems to be enjoyable, almost a commercial like scent, but just enjoyable, you won't be blown away by this.\n\nThe soap performance is top notch for me, I would categorize it as top tier, and one of my personal favorites to use. It just performs insanely well, easy to lather, slickness for days, and good post-shave. Glad I was able to get one of these tubs.\n\nHappy Thursday!",

I actually didn't get any shaving related gifts this year...does my family still love me?\n\nFougere Bouquet is a good scent, but I think I like Fougere Parfait better. With that said, WK is a great performer that always gives me a good shave. Also, I realized that I've been using this same SilverBlue blade for quite a while now. I haven't kept count, but I'm probably at like 10-15 shaves with it and it just keeps chugging along. I may have to pop a fresh one in and see if I can take it to the 100 club.",

Means, you have to put in a little extra time, but are rewarded with a high-quality lather. *Aviator* is a really well done leather forward scented soap. I wasn't surprised by the lather, since RPS was one of my first six soap brands I ever purchased and I know it's a quality soap. Fantastic shave this morning after skipping yesterday. Brand new blade in the razor and a BBS was had with little effort. Great Thursday shaves to all.",

      "body": "1/3/10 SOTD\n\nSo like [Bruce Wayne wandering in the Tibetan wilderness] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_a3L242qYWo) I have taken a break from my normal SOTD posting routine to do some training and purification and step up my shaving game. (Plus it was Christmas and New Years and all...).\n\nMy new super-heroesque 2019 goal: to master a two pass BBS shave. (I was considering fighting injustice and turning fear against those who prey on the fearful, but figured that one had already been done...)\n\n* Razor: Colonial General SS\n* Blade: Feather Proguard (6)\n* Brush: Muhle STF V2 25mm\n* Soap: Eufros Ylang Ylang\n* Post: Cremo Cooling Balm\n* Frag: Lauder Devin EDC\n\n* Product Notes:\n\n* Razor / Blade: I am liking Proguard more than I used to. I last tried these in a RazoRock Hawk and was not impressed so I PIFed 'em. The heavier General SS seems to bring out the best in the blade, and it had a much milder set of initial shaves than the normal Feather Pros. Usually the first shave or two with the Pro feels harsh and then things even out for the next 10 shaves or so, but the Proguards were mild mannered from shave one and seem more or less as efficient as the Pros. But more expensive, alas!\n\n* Brush: The STF continues to be a very unique synth, a brush aiming to emulate something like a Shavemac D01 or Simpson Best, e.g. an unusually firm three band. It does this very well, marching to its solitary drum as most new synths these days aim to emulate two bands, after the glut of Plisson mushy imitators. The really well done resin handle is very appealing here, but the interesting performance is the main draw.\n\n* Frag: The House of Lauder offers some of the most interesting scents at value pricing that are now available. Devin is a marvelous grassy, green resinous scent that should have more fans.\n\n* Theme: I got nothing shave related for Christmas. I did get a laptop and a nice watch though, so no complaints, but no thematic compliance either.\n\n* Two pass BBS? Yes, this combo can easily manage that goal. Is that just possible with AC blades or also with DE blades in a sufficiently efficient head? Stay tuned!",

I wasn't a huge fan of the scent at first sniff, but it is quickly rising up the ranks. It's definitely complex, and I can't seem to get enough. It's leather forward, but also has notes that remind me of old dusty books and stale air. In some weird nostaglia, it takes me back to walking in an old run-down Sears or JCPenny's. Unfortunately after shaving with it a couple of times, I'm still getting some decent irritation from something in the soap. I don't have a reaction with any other soap, so I'm not sure what it is. I'm going to power through a few more times and see if I can beat it since I love the scent so much.",

I'm getting used to Spice. On first sniff, it does fall behind Lavender, Cool, Classic, and Fern (in order) for my preference on Reserve scents. That doesn't mean it's bad. I like them all, in fact. Looking forward to smelling Waves for the first time soon, too.\n\nFor those who have Seville in Reserve, does the scent come through differently in that format vs. Glissant base and Tonique splash, or are they pretty much identical in scent, differing only in performance?\n\nHappy Thursday shaves, all.\n\nEdit: Also without realizing it, my shave today fits the theme!

This scent was nice and crisp off the soap, so I went with Brut, but the floral notes in the soap became much more prominent upon lathering. Pretty good stuff.

The soap I got from my wife this year, and she nailed it. It's an incredible scent with awesome performance. The Razor I got from my late grandma last year for Christmas, so it technically fits theme lol.\n\nAnyway, about the shave, I actually haven't had it yet. I always shave on Gamedays, and today will be no different. The Pepperdine Waves traveled to Provo, Utah to take on BYU tonight at 7 pm local time, and I will be shaving around 2 pm before we head out to the game (and during half time of the Liverpool Man City match today). Should be an excellent shave.\n\nHappy Shaves Y'all and Go Waves!",

First time using Mood Indigo, my Blackbird, and the brush. The GSB was even a fresh blade.\n\nHonestly, not a great shave. The Mood Indigo was awesome. The lather was slick and dense, and I really like the scent. It's fruity and boozy, but it has a sophisticated feel to it. The blueberry and rum are the top notes for me, but I think the vetiver, black pepper, etc. probably add to the darker base and feel. Really a great scent, and it's lasted for 5 or 6 hours so far.\n\nThe brush was cool. It's got some backbone and scritch to it--definitely not my softest brush. It whipped up lather like a champ though, and I will definitely use it again. Thanks /u/RodOfDestiny!\n\nAh, the Blackbird. What a beautifully built razor. However, my shave was not so beautiful. I got quite a bit of blade feel on the WTG and XTG passes, and the ATG chopped me to bits. I should have realized that was going to happen and skipped the pass, but alas, I did not. I'm going to try a different blade in it to see if I get better results. It was definitely efficient, and I actually got a great shave apart from the nicks on my trouble area (underneath my chin), but I feel like I took a couple layers of skin off too.",

First time with this razor and it shaves like a dream. I'm still verrrry new to straight shaving, maybe 5-6 shaves total. But I love the audible feedback on this guy, really a pleasure to use.\n\nThe soap is from Max Schaefer, really nice suds and scented with a dupe of a frag that was created for the movie The Grand Budapest Hotel, used by the main character a few times on screen. It's described as a floral chypre, and while I've never smelled the real frag, this is a pleasant and interesting scent. I picked up the fruit and decided to embrace it and go with C2. Great shave altogether.",

Nocturne reminds me in many ways of \"Roam\", but I digress. I transitioned to DE shaving a year ago and in hindsight, wish I had made the move sooner.\n\nWhat else can I say? Astras are a reader favorite around here. I personally tried nearly thirty blades from [try a blade](http://www.tryablade.com) before commiting to Astras. The hype around them are real. my Razor is a maggard MR3, but after a year, I am considering an upgrade. Any suggestions from the community?",

Southwest wind 5 to 10 mph. High tide at 10:34 tonight.\n\nDaughter picked out the brush today. While this brush was my daily driver for a good time, before I found out what a good badger could feel like, I have found that I like the feel of a badger brush more than I do to synthetics. I haven't used the Timeless on consecutive days for some time now and it's been missed. I was going to used the Gillette Adjustable for two blades worth of shaves but I found that I wasn't getting good shaves out it.\n\nMeanwhile I think I've found the next tub of soap that I am going to try to kill. I've had this tub of MFP for a little more than two years now, I got it used, and have scooped a sample or two out of it but it's still hanging around. There is little to no scent left on the puck (to my nose anyway). The performance is top notch, and I would like to spend some time with it to really dial it in.\n\nHave a nice Friday everyone!",

Its simple and beautiful. The ATT continue to be my daily driver and made a immediate improvement to my shave. I think I still could work some of my technique as I sometimes get some irritation at the corner fold of my chin, so I'll have to pay some extra attention to angle and pressure at that point of my shave. This looks to be a great Friday as I'm off and get to spend some time with my 8 month old son. Fatherhood has been amazing.",

What a difference between the two. Even with soaking the AoS in hot water, it couldn't stand up to the Maggard. Normally I stick to barbershop or oriental scented soaps during the workday, and keep the fragrance soaps for after work, but today I felt like changing it up. I've been using Stirling \"Sharp Dressed Man\" more then \"Executive Man\" lately, but the scent is just as good as I remember.",

Great shave with it, although it took a pass to get back into the slant mentality.\n\nI really like this brush, picked it up on my visit to Maggard's and haven't regretted the impulse buy. That said, it piques my interest for getting a better badger (hence my thread in yesterday's Daily Questions thread, thanks for all the replies).\n\nMy first shave with Vespers. Was really looking forward to trying this base. I have to say though, after shaving with some softer soaps, my first try at lathering it up failed miserably. This soap is definitely harder than what I have been shaving with the past couple of months so my usual load just didn't get enough on the brush. Could be that I am still dialing in the new badger brush as well. But, after getting nothing but thin lather, I tried again but loaded the brush up with a bit more vigor and got some fantastic results.\n\nPerformance on this new B&M base is absolutely fantastic. Slick, moisturizing and provided a ton of cushion. Very happy with my purchase (another one I got from my visit to Maggard's).\n\nFor me, the jury is still out on the scent though. It seemed pretty weak compared to a bunch of other soaps I have, but I have read that it may take a few shaves for it to really come into its own. The wife liked it, so that is a good plus. In addition, and I am attributing this to my slight cold that Patient Zero (my 4yr old daughter) brought into the house, I couldn't pick out a single note from the tub. It was a nice combination of scents, but nothing that I was like 'OMG, that is really nice'. But I am going to give this soap a few more shaves before I come to a complete conclusion on it.\n\nOverall, great shave for one of the first ones of 2019.\n",

RIP\n\nThis soap is a sample from a new soap maker, Murray & McNeil (I believe /u/assistantpigkeeper has also tested for them). This particular shaving soap sample came in a small, square plastic sample pack with an easy-to-rip top, and as it's namesake, has a Celtic trinity knot as the scent logo (each scent has a different Celtic or otherwise esoteric symbol for the logo). The shaving soap itself was more of a croap, and lathered easily while being slightly thirsty. Slickness was decent, but residual slickness was not enough for multiple passes without lathering the face again. Scent-wise, Trinity is an Aventus-clone, similar strength to Fine Platinum but less than DG Sellout. Overall, this was a decent soap that allowed for a good shave, and I'm interested in seeing what the other soaps/scents are like as this new soap maker continues to improve his base and expand his line of soaps.\n\nBig thanks to /u/reguyw_nothingtolose, who included the Imaginary Authors sample with the Latha Taiga/Flying Hide (RIP) sets! This one, Every Storm a Serenade, is intriguing; I can put my finger on juniper and bergamot (?), but need to explore this one further.\n\nHappy Friday everyone, keep calm and shave on.

Trying new scent of LeBelle. And first shave with my new 1305 Semogue.\n\n## Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Timeless .68 - Open Comb ::: Astra - Platinum ‹8 uses›)*\n\nworked pretty well. but got a small cut. The difference in the open comb version of the .68 and the scalloped bar is quite large, to me at least. I wouldn't have a problem using this as a daily shaver at all, but for folks with skin like me, I would not put it in the \"comfortable\" category. That is consistent across 2 blades now. So we'll keep working on it.\n\nNo tugging, not really any irritation.\n\n## Soap Notes\n*^(LeBelle Soaps - Two Roads)*\n\nnice and slick. This is a good base.\n\nNot going to mention soap ratios, because in breaking in a new boar, I had to use more soap than usual.\n\nScent: something like amber seems the most dominant scent, with a woody smell coming along once lathered. Maybe a conifer like fir, I dunno. wasn't strong.\n\nScent strength: 3/10. lightly with you during the shave.\n\n\n## Brush Notes\n*^(Semogue - 1305)*\n\nWorked surprisingly well during first shave. I did soak it (bristles only) for a few hours prior to use.\n\nThis is the same knot as the 830, which is the brush I started out with. I love the knot, but it's acrylic short and slippery handle lost me. Now I hope this guy, with the longer handle, will help me enjoy it.\n\n## Shave Quality\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Few hairs are showing some tip length (with most being cut flush)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm)\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

I figured I'd try the Blackbird and Karve CB once each, and then focus on one for a while to nail it down and then the other. I think I'm going to start with the Blackbird even though it gave me a much harsher shave than the CB. Just feeling like a challenge I guess.\n\nI won the Santa's Workshop set in that charity raffle a couple of weeks ago (thanks /u/cooperandfrench!). They also hooked me up with a bunch of bath soaps and shaving soap samples. I'm pretty set! Wow, this soap lathered up incredibly easily. The performance was solid, and the scent is excellent. My wife is a big fan.\n\nHas anyone else tried CL's Unscented Salve in their new formula? I'd be interested to hear others impressions as this was my first time trying it.",

My wife somehow snagged me a brand new tub of Bufflehead that I've never fuckin heard of and she got so excited for me, she gave it to me damn near a month early! I honestly don't know what I did to deserve this woman, but damn am I glad I did whatever that was! As for the soap itself, the performance is top notch as always. Great protection and slickness, just like you'd expect from Bufflehead. As for the scent, I suck at naming specific notes, but on first sniff, it's a real understated floral note that opens up when lathered into an almost even distribution of aquatic and floral. I'll try to sniff it periodically throughout the day and use it again soon. Maybe by then I can get a better handle on just what it is.",

This was right, because the shave had a lot less blade feel than I remember.\n\nVery nice. Cella was great, too.\n\n## Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Gillette - NEW Short Comb ::: PolSilver ‹11 uses›)*\n\nThis guy is deceptive, because he holds the blade very close to the edge. So sometimes he feels super smooth, but his geometry is kinda aggressive. This shave was excellent. Might take a bit of work to learn really irritation-free technique with it though, at least for folks with skin like me. The irritation I'm getting could also be attributed to brush burn, with this new-ish boar.\n\nThis razor is excellent at cutting down multiple day's growth.\n\nNo tugging, just awesome slicing.\n\n## Soap Notes\n*^(Cella)*\n\nTub-load notes (soft silvertip badger): 45 sec load with a lightly wet brush + 3 tsp water = gave me an extra pass or so. Lather was protective and enjoyable. Funny how much of a difference changing brushes makes.\n\nTub-load notes (with dense 2-band badger): 40 second load (with this brush, at least) is about right. This lather might have been spot on. Seemed a bit too dry, but I think that is just the way Cella is. Any wetter, and I start losing creaminess and glide. A lightly wet brush used during load and less than .5 tsp of water for the lather. Might just be a model lather for Cella.\n\nPast scooping notes: Try 1/8 tsp or so next time. 1/4 tsp gave me 3x as much lather as I needed. But that day it looked hot!\n\nScent was great and about 4-5/10 for strength. Nice and present during shave.\n\n\n## Brush Notes\n*^(Omega - 10098)*\n\nA little prickle, but did pretty well.\n\n## Shave Quality\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Smooth\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Cut flush to where I just see the tips (above average for me)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm)\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

It's been a slow work week because of the holiday and a lot of people just taking the rest of the week off. However, last night I started training on some fuel pans on one of the parts I work on, and I got to weld one. This is an aluminum, x-ray quality weld joint, for those who know, this is highly difficult to do because everything needs to be super clean. I just need to do a cover pass Monday, as it was too hot last night, and then it's off to x-ray. Have a good weekend.",

This one I just kind of added on for the hell of it, but really wanted to try the platinum lux. This blade took me by surprise during this shave because most reviews I've seen are negative. I had a really nice, close shave with minimal irritation.\n\nThe blades themselves seem to be thicker than most double edge blades, I can definitely feel the difference when I hold them in my hand. That might lead to the blade staying a bit steadier than some, or even having a different bevel than others. I'm not exactly sure, but I did have enjoyable shave.\n\nSo it looks like I'm going to have to try this one, along with the bolzano supernox, and treet classic in my 48-52 superspeed to get an even better idea of how they shave.",

The Nacet did not disappoint. Also trying something new in breaking in my Semogue Boars. And finally, I tried the Gold Dachs Sport puck that has been looking at me since 2017's Christmas!\n\nAlso my first try with the Gillette After Shave Gel. Worked pretty well! Standard \"blue\" smell.\n\n## Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Gillette - Sheraton 1938 ::: Gillette - Nacet ‹108 uses›)*\n\nAs usual, the shave was comfortable and enjoyable. No tugging or irritation. Great result on my neck with a close shave. Above average, for sure.\n\n## Soap Notes\n*^(Gold Dachs - Sport)*\n\nIt's been a while since I used my other pucks of this soap: Classic and Sandalwood. The base is nice and I get a superbly slick lather. This is a German hard soap, and so it will last a while.\n\n7min soak + 40 sec load with lightly-wet brush + 2 3/4 tsp water = just about the right amount of lather in a super slick consistency, with some good cushion too.\n\nThough performance was high, Scent Strength was low: 2-3/10. Standard sporty scent. Very lightly available during the shave. But since it's a hard soap, I can pretty much keep it forever.\n\n\n## Brush Notes\n*^(Semogue - 1305)*\n\nRegarding the break-in on this boar, it is going really well. I'm soaking it for a few hours before each shave and I just finished shave 2. It worked really well today. The tips need to split more for a more comfy feel, but it's really good already! As far as the splay, and being able to hold enough lather, for a bowl-latherer, it's already there.\n\n## Shave Quality\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Cut flush to where I just see the tips (above average for me)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm)\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

The cream was decent in terms of slickness but when it came time to rinse it never seemed to rinse off fully. I was going to use Santal Austere, but as I was going to grab the bottle I felt my face and it was dry as all hell. Decided to go with some Scale Polish to help combat that.

It is very similar to the Superspeed I tried a few days ago. [Rockets are basically English Superspeeds but the TTO knob goes in and out as you open and close it](https://theshaveden.com/forums/threads/gillette-rocket-the-refined-de.8590/). This Rocket is also a bit heavier, coming in at 65g over the Superspeed's 55g. They both deliver mild, smooth, and close shaves through 3.5 passes but I like the Rocket more due to the heavier weight and the cooler (IMO) engineering. I was able to get my Rocket from a local antique dealer and could try the action before I bought and this one and ir feels really, really good. Superspeeds and Rockets are best suited for ATG passes IMO as WTG hardly does anything at all. I might do 2 XTG, one in reverse, next time as my first two passes.\n\nThe West of Olympia Sins base is very good. I like it as much as Declaration Bison, APR, and Glissant. Give this base a go if you can, especially if you like the others I mentioned. The scent is also quite something. It's spicy and warm and very enjoyable. One of those chameleon scents that can pair with many splashes. It definitely has the barbershop vibe that it's going for but it also is toying with being a Fougere. This is why I paired it with TSM Fougere and I've been wanting to pair TSM with Florian for a while as well and used this as an opportunity for experiment. They worked well together with the splash serving as a bridge between the spicy barbershop of Pride with the Citrusy fougere of Florian. However, I think the soap will actually pair much nicer with Fougere Gothique splash and EdP which I will try next time. I didn't buy the Gothique soap and have been on the lookout for a substitute and this might be it! Another candidate for pairing is Chaipre but that one's still in the mail.\n\nThe Semogue 1800 is starting to shine. I gave it an overnight soak in some Icarus lather a couple of weeks ago and it's really helped it. Tips are softer and it holds much more soap now, enough for 4 passes and it has some nice backbone for how high it's loft is.\n\nThanks for reading and have a great Sunday!",

I took this picture while the lighting was still good, and it turned out so well I couldn't wait to post it.\n\nUpdate: to keep it brief. This was the second chance I gave the bolzano, and I ended up with a couple weepers which rarely happens and ended up with some irritation. I'm not a fan of these blades, but maybe I just haven't found the right razor for them.\n\nI made a makeshift scuttle from a large soup mug, and a metal bowl I seat inside it. It works well, and its really nice to have warm lather for a change.\n\nAnyway, tomorrow I think I'll give treet classics another chance. Unless my Gillette NEW comes in the mail which is likely, in that case I'm either throwing a nacet, a silver blue, or a polsilver in that baby and giving it a go. I can't really go wrong with any of those three.",

This soap smells amazing and strong off the puck, but doesn't make your eyes water and keeps its scent strength as you lather.\n\nIt easily explodes into the most pillowy dense slick lather I have every made. I needed to add very little water to get what I got. Great glide and no irritation from the shave. The post shave is rock solid.\n\nWith one shave, this artisan has taken a solid spot in my top 3.",

Now, I was very hesitant to consider actually using the razor because of the plastic handle. What kind of shave could I possibly get with such a cheap looking handle? A pretty damn good shave, especially when I adjust the dial all the way up to 8! Smooth and efficient, just like I like my razors.\n\nAs for the soap, even though I was given the scent notes by the creator himself, I'm having a hard time picking them out individually. I mean that in the most positive possible way because these different scents are so wonderfully mixed as to be totally indiscernible to my nose. Still such a great soap in all aspects. I wanted to use an aftershave with it, so I went with Cryogenic because...well, because. Now, I received my bottle in a trade and, unbeknownst to me, the reducer was broken so I poured my remaining aftershave into an empty Clearasil toner bottle that belonged to my wife. Holy shit does it pour out fast! I sit here with tears just pouring down my face because I couldn't un-pour what I already used!\n\nAnd as for ACOF, I'm trying to reduce the amount of samples that I own in my cabinet, so I just grabbed one since I couldn't see and sprayed it on. Pow! Guess I'll smell like burnt matches today. At least I'll enjoy it!!",

Great scent, I've really been enjoying this one. I have to admit I was a bit worried the very first time I unscrewed the lid and took a whiff, I thought it smelled like grape! But once lathered it really evolved into a nice complex lavender scent. I did not use any beard oil/balm today, I trimmed it way down last night with the clippers as it was starting to look a bit wild with stray hairs sticking out everywhere.",

At least I started the day off with a wonderful shave. I was probably on three or four days of growth. Had to take very short strokes on the first pass to mow through it without clogging up the razor. Had plenty of lather for a WTG and 2 XTG passes (in opposing directions) and came away somewhere between DFS and BBS.\n\nPerhaps most importantly, I like how I smell. Not sure about the rest of you fine folks, but smelling good helps me get my game face on so I can go face all the ridiculous people at work. The meetings start before my commute is even done (gonna have to dial in to that first one) but they don't get really heavy until tomorrow.\n\nWish me luck!",

It had been a while since I used it so I decided to dig out this sample of Woodlands as a reminder. IMHO, this is a highly underrated soap, especially for the price. It can whip up a dense, slick and creamy lather with the best of them. I finished off the shave with another product I haven't used in a while, DG aftershave. I'm so glad I picked this up to go with my soap. I was reminded just how good Scott's splashes are. They have the perfect amount of menthol and the skin care ingredients do so well for my face. I absolutely love the scent of Chaipre as well. Very nice stuff!",

I like both the light Calypso and the heavy General SS for SE razors, and really have no preference between them.\n\n* Brush: Probably the heaviest handle I own and also the only stone handle in my collection. Great feel! The Elite bulb took a while to grow on me, as I feel it is optimized for bowl shaving. Still, as the brush has broken in, and as my target number of passes per shave has diminished, we are comfortable with each other. As with my other Elites, the knot ages very well and has virtually no horizontal stragglers and has lost not a strand.\n\n* Frag: hard to believe this was once America's most popular scent for men! To me, it is dank, mossy, woody, and ominous, kind of like a troll's den in a bottle. But an awesome cold weather scent, and one of Lauren's best!",

This one was their take on bay rum. Very straightforward, with bay prominent, but not too much rum or spice. Overall, I was pretty impressed by this brand. The regular base is solid, and the premium with duck fat in addition to tallow is quite good. The scents were lovely, though some were likely frag dupe FOs. The packaging is excellent. Definitely worth checking them out. Not at top tier yet, but could be seriously competitive with a few tweaks.",

Gave Lamplight Penance a whirl on Saturday for the first time, and it was awesome. LP really is a crazy scent, and I'm glad I picked up the set. I pretty much had to after the best of 2018 thread. My wife said I smelled like she imagines Lin Manuel Miranda's character in the new Mary Poppins movie smells. She's a big fan of his, so that's a win.\n\nSellout is a good scent as well. I actually got a bit of tingle while using it, which surprised me, but it wasn't so bad that I won't do it a couple more times to see what happens. Cologne scents are typically not my favorite, but my wife really digs it. I do think it will be nice to have this in the rotation to change things up.\n\nThe Polsiver SI is WAY better in the Blackbird than GSBs. A much less harsh shave, though it still isn't super comfortable. I think I'll figure out eventually. Gonna give a Wizamet blade a try next.",

This soap has been contentious to some, though perhaps not to the same level as B&M's \"Night Music\", Chiseled Face \"Midnight Stag\" or Stirling's \"Texas on Fire\".\n\nBarrister and Mann web describes Roam as, \"Inspired by the rugged individualism of American cattle ranchers, we blended the aromas of real pipe tobacco absolute, smoke, leather, herbs, damp earth, and grass into a bright, robust scent reminiscent of life on the open range. Timeless and virile, Roam harkens back to the days of the Old West.\"\n\nLather is top notch and what I would expect from a B&M soap. The scent is wet grass or hay, fresh tobacco, wood smoke, wet tilled earth and old leather. I think Roam pairs nicely with a single spray of Aramis \"New West\" as the tobacco and woodsmoke pair well with the coniferous overtones of New West.\n\nAll in all, I love this combo. I don't think it's work appropriate, the smell won't be pleasing to everyone, but I personally love it for a day off. As far as hardware goes, I used my very old Merkur 34c that I bought seven years ago when I tried DE shaving for the first time. I prefer my Maggards over it, but I think for someone just getting into DE, it's mild enough that the learning curve wouldn't be too bad.",

I love Stirling's barbershop. It was the first full size tub of soap that I ordered, and I love coming back to it. After shaving for a week with a synthetic brush thanks to travel, I can concurrently say that I much prefer badger brushes, and I really enjoyed coming back to the badger.\n\nHappy Shave's Y'all!",

This was just a quick shave brecause I'm short on time. But it ended up to be one of the best I've vever had! After just 3 passes, my troubles pot was bare! Never is like this.\n\n## Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Timeless .68 - Open Comb ::: PolSilver ‹12 uses›)*\n\nThis blade, with 11 uses on it, is perfect for this razor. Smooth feeling, not like the newer blades I've tried lately. Wow! Such efficient cutting. I wish I had time to say more. This was a quick shave and it ended up to be one of my best ever!\n\nNo tugging, almost no irritation.\n\n## Soap Notes\n*^(Declaration Grooming - Icarus Sellout)*\n\nIcarus is great as usual. I like Bison maybe a little better, but this is excellent.\n\n30 sec load with lightly wet badger + 2 tsp water = gave me just the right amount of soap for 3.5 passes and it was the perfect consistency for me: slick, but creamy.\n\nScent is very nice version of Aventus.\n\nStrength is 3-4/10 and was lightly present during shave. Any lighter and I may have had to pass it on to someone else.\n\n\n## Brush Notes\n*^(Declaration Grooming - B5 24mm Hammer & Chisel)*\n\nMy fav brush. Bats 1000 on all fronts.\n\n## Shave Quality\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Smooth\n*Neck*: Smooth\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm)\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

Its the most aggressive razor in my rotation, if you don't count my 3A head which I don't because I don't like or use it. So it has a perfect spot in my collection.\n\nI have to keep a super light touch with this thing especially with a fresh nacet. After getting a feel for this razor it was a great shave, I did open up the spot I nicked yesterday so it looks like I may need to leave that spot alone on the next shave to let it get completely healed.\n\nHad a great combination of stuff this shave, I'm a lavender addict and this shave definitely scratched that itch. All in all just a nice shave tonight.",

I scored this soap off of Mr. Marketing Genius himself and I'm super glad I did. The scent on this is very good. It's a bit floral but nothing crazy and comes off as soft to me. Hard to pick out individual notes, like most Bufflehead's its slightly muted and well blended. I really like it and could see it being a great spring scent. I haven't used one of these salt mining soaps in quite awhile and I forgot how much this base just explodes lather. I very easily got a nice thick shiny lather that was very slick and left my skin soft and supple. Even given the very short ingredients list this is still an upper tier soap for me. Sure it's no Icarus, Noble Otter, Bison, or Reserve base but it's just a very tiny notch below those and that's nothing to scoff at. Vide Poche seemed like a perfect match because it's basically the only floral I have but you can't go wrong with a Chatty Lux aftershave.\n\nHappy Tuesday let's get through this shit hole.",

The slickness and post shave feel are some of the best I've experienced. I held off on the post shave for about an hour and was very pleased with the results. This was my ~10th shave with the Polsilver which may have been its last, but I see a bulk order of these in my future, possibly taking the #1 spot from beloved GSB's.",

Good scent here, my nose has a pretty longstanding disagreement with chypres and it didn't start off too well here. I'm not sure what it interpreted the combination of smells as, but it didn't are too much for it at first. However, as the shave went on the scent developed for me and I started to enjoy it more and more. Aftershave was even better, but I didn't spend too long admiring it before spraying some Eau Sauvage and heading to work.

May change this set out soon out of boredom rather than necessity.\n\n* Soap: Shannon's for me has always been an almost-first-tier soap. The scents have always been well done, but protection and post shave always felt more like typical vegan soap rather than tallow. I had hoped the \"Rust Belt Reserve\" line would step technical performance up, but instead it merely used higher quality aromachemicals for the scent design along with a more complex scent. Not bad things, but not exactly the game changer I was looking for.\n\n* The scent here is quite nice - a sweet, woodsy and floral lavender. Maybe a tad too much lavender in the mix that overwhelms some of the less forceful scents also alleged to be in the formula, but if you are fond of lavender, all is good.\n\n* And performance? Still a bit lacking compared to the best, but the nicely broken in AC blade made things a tad more tolerable, and the super effective post shave from Cremo helped soothe all wounds. So not a bad shave at all, but in a world of shaving artisan giants, Shannons continues to be of only slightly above average height.\n\n* Frag: A wonderful cold day / office scent, not much connection to Lavanille, as it has much more amber in it, but still a classic piece of work. And affordably priced also!\n\n",

First time using the skin salve as a pre-shave, first time for the Trail and first time for the splash. The Trail and the splash were great, it's a shame the soap is only a sample, I really liked it. The skin salve too has been my nightly moisturiser for a few weeks now and decided to try it as a pre shave. It worked well, it's not providing any slickness but my hairs definitely felt softer, it's not a fair test though as I normally shave after a shower. More research needed!",

I got to enjoy a fantastic Reserve shave last night for both my head and face.\n\nI've stuck with using soap samples on my head until their gone and B&M Reserve Fern is next on that list. The scent from the sample jar was a bit muted which opened up to a much brighter scent once lathered. While the Reserve Fern scent is not for me, there's no doubt about the soap base which gave me a very slick and protective shave as always. I'll still continue to use it until it's gone but it's not likely one I'll pick up.\n\nI love Seville both in Reserve and Glissant and can't wait until Will transitions it over to the Excelsior base. Seville in any base will continue to remain in my regular rotation. It's just that good!\n\nHappy shavings!",

I decided to try these again in my Superspeed to truly see how I feel about these blades. The verdict is... Really great. I'm thinking right next to polsilver, and Gillette silver blue great.\n\nThis shave was bbs, with zero irritation. Having a nice quality lather helped with that as much as the razor and the blade did.\n\nFor those if you thinking about picking up some of these blades I should let you know these are carbon steel. That means as soon as you're done shaving you need to take the blade out and dry it to prevent oxidation. Along with that, I recommend coating the blade with oil after using it, this prevents it from getting wet. I just use preshave oil which seems to work fine.\n\nIdk if these blades perform so well because they are carbon steel which has slightly different properties than stainless, or just that they save money with carbon steel so they can spend more machining them. Either way these are remarkable blades.",

The regular blue tin. I used a gillette guard yesterday, oh boy thay blade had done its job. But this time i am back home with my r89 and yes! This was the charm! Much better shave!\n\nAnd the soap and splash, still like them. Not a big fan of leather, but this soap makes it work. It is supposed to be a barbershop scented soap, and with both this and b&m seville in my bathroom cabinet... i have bo idea what barbershop even means.\n\nBut it was a good shave with a good soap and hopefully my skin will feel better any day now. Maybe if i stop shaving it will heal faster from the winds, weather, and being scratched by a small child whose nails i forgot to cut.",

This is probably my favorite setup right now as it is an excellent performer on all fronts. And I smell like and 80's powerhouse :).\n\nI used my new Lockhart's medium hold pomade this morning too and I have to say, I'm impressed. It has a nice sandalwood scent and my hair is looking and feeling it's best. Good Wednesday to all.",

Every day so far, my technique is getting a little better and a little better. I really think that I overall prefer SE to DE. Granted, I still TOTALLY suck with a straight, so I might end up putting that to the side for a while and coming back eventually when I don't have a beard, but the SE have really made the daily cleanup around it vastly easier than the DE I've used so far.\n\nAnyway, great shave today and as long as I can FINALLY get all my ducks in a row with Excelsior College, I'll hopefully be back in \"school\" by next week. I swear, every time I think I've gotten everything taken care of, I ask and there's four more things I already should've done. It's craziness!!!",

Good shave: close and comfortable.\n\n## Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Gillette - Sheraton 1938 ::: Gillette - Nacet ‹110 uses›)*\n\nStill rocking. I do more buffing than I may have early on, but this combo is still doing well. and Delivering an above-average shave.\n\n## Soap Notes\n*^(Noble Otter - Lonestar)*\n\nLonestar has a great scent! Manly and well-mixed with good notes. I could easily see wearing this as an EDT (if my wife liked anything other than Aqua Di Gio! and GIT).\n\nTheir base is top notch. Creamy and slick.\n\nTub-Loading: 30 sec load with lightly wet boar brush + 2 tsp water = perfect amount and consistency for me.\n\nScooping: 1/4- tsp of soap + 2.5 tsp water made a great lather, and just the right amount for 3.5 passes, using my Romero Manchurian brush.\n\nScent Strength: 5/10 IIRC. Nicely available during shave, but not obtrusive.\n\n\n## Brush Notes\n*^(Omega - 10098)*\n\nprickle hasn't gone away yet. But very servicable. Put an o-ring on it so it wouldn't have so much loft.\n\n## Shave Quality\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Cut flush to where I just see the tips (above average for me)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm)\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

High near 36. West wind 5 to 15 mph, with gusts as high as 30 mph. Chance of precipitation is 80%. Little or no ice accumulation expected. Total daytime snow and sleet accumulation of 1 to 2 inches possible. High tide at 1:07 this afternoon.\n\nSecond day this week that the Small One has a 2-hour delay for school so a nice relaxed shave for this morning. Great shave all around. Armada Blossom is a great match for LGC. Not sure what base this LGC is, but still lathered up great. The blade is coming to the end of it's useful life.\n\nHave a nice Wednesday everyone!",

Not sure if this was a technique misfire or if the Poli / Paradigm combo is not quite as capable of shaving as closely as the AC combo I've been using so far in 2019 to get the quickie BBS effect. Will try again tomorrow...\n\n* Soap: Love the scent - a floral effect using non-floral scent elements. Cleverly done! Performance wise? Really good - somewhere between Glissant and Reserve I would say - some days I think this base to the equal of Reserve, other days I think maybe slightly less effective. But overall an excellent technical base, certainly in my top 5. The erratic and limited production is the issue with this brand. More makers should take advantage of Chiseled Face's services in producing and selling their soaps, but CF so far seems to have worked so far only with \"museum\" soaps, i.e. products from moribund artisans with established and static scent designs, nothing new in the pipeline. Talbot seems a bit more vital than that, but the experience of most buyers never being able to buy the soap undoubtedly hurts the brand. 2019 wishlist: CF synergistic engagement with low production brands such as Talbot to boost availability while also allowing the brand to continue to design new scents and even perhaps bases.\n\n* Frag: the very poor man's Aventus. Even without the moderate intensity pineapple, this is a classic powerhouse frag, full of complexity even in the base and of impressive projection and longevity.",

So I tried it last night with amazing results. I put in about 1/4in of warm water in the tub while I was getting my shave ready after my shower. Dumped the water out into a small cup and used it as the additional water when I was building my lather. Really, really fantastic. I pulled my brush from my sink, shook off the excess water and loaded. Was able to build that DG lather really quickly and the post shave feel was top-notch.\n\nHighly suggest doing this for any Icarus soap!\n\nShave went well, 37c was its effective self in giving me a BBS shave in 2 1/2 passes.\n\nPost shave, I did have a weeper due to a blemish on my face so I threw on a bit of the menthol Darkfall AS and then some of the liniment. There is no competition for how soft your face feels after a Icarus shave followed by the liniment. IMO DG liniment is the GOAT post-shave product.\n\nOverall, a really fantastic shave.",

My shaved are so smooth now, and being able to change the aggressiveness of the blade is really nice. Waves performed very well and I love the scent. Pretty sure once I finish this sample I am going to pick up a full set. Have a great Wednesday everyone!",

My first time trying Seville and let me tell you I was sorely disappointed. The base is great. Nice post shave. ,great slickness. But the scent isn't for me. I think I'm going to buy reserve classic ,thus completing my reserve sets with matching after-shave of course.\n\nI'm just about done with my samples not counting Stirling's offering, about 5 pucks. I was thinking. That I haven't touched any of my tube of soap. I've just been sampling and buying, it's not a good cycle.I have 10 soaps and matching aftershaves I should be enjoying. I think I'd like to start Doing that! Life is short and I'm not shaving to the fullest!",

I really love YRP and don't know why I haven't picked up the matching aftershave or toner yet. The balm is perfect for this cold weather.\n\nI won't have a chance to kill this tub off this year but I have been steady killing off samples that I've been using on my head. I probably have 3 or 4 more shaves left on the Reserve Fern and will move on to the next sample after that. Hopefully I can get through my box of samples in the next few months but we'll see.",

Just after i finished my first pass I carelessly sliced my finger open. 20 minutes of pressure later and the bleeding has stopped.\n\nDidn't plan on using my cheshire sample but I had to find something I could apply one handed, sample spray bottles work well for this. The pairing actually worked together quite well.\n\nOverall I wouldn't be looking to repeat this experience.",

The end of 5 12s straight and the start of a 2 day break, haha. For this shave, I went with my first real soap set. I started out wetshaving years ago, but I did it with CO Bigelow (Proraso green). It was such an aha moment after using Oleo that I can't ever go back. Now, Oleo is the baseline for every other soap comparison. I would say that the only drawback to this set is that the aftershave splash has like zero skin food. I believe there's a new formulation circulating that actually has skin food now. Have a great day, folks!\n\n",

It had gotten pretty long so I decided I'd use one of my straight razors and try my hand at that again. It went bad. So very bad. I was lazy with the prepwork, I thought I could make up for it with a good lather. The hairs did not want to come off. Under the chin proved exceptionally difficult. Maybe I'd forgotten how to shave that area since it's been so long? After a patchy first pass, I was left with a dozen hairs right under my lip, another dozen right under my nose, and a whole carpet swatch under my chin. Oh, and I'd already nicked myself at least 4 times.\n\nI should have thrown in the towel there. Instead, I redoubled my efforts. Made another lather, re-prepped my face. I didn't care how many times I knew I cut my face, I just wanted all the long hairs gone so I could look presentable. Well, I managed to get the long hairs, my under chin was left with stubble. Then came the alum. Oh it reminded me of my first shaves with a DE. I had no more straggling hairs so I was presentable, yes? That's where you're wrong. I left my face with no fewer than 9 cuts around the chin/mouth area. But I still shaved today. Very tenderly. With love.\n\nR/wetshaving, lend me your healing powers.\n\nLife is short, shave with good gear.\n\n\n",

The slickness is much better than all the other bases, including Excelsior.\n\nPicture day was perfect for my first 3 hour night class tonight. 3 hour lecture on convection. This will be interesting.\n\nHappy Thursday!",

Lavande Poivre is the first of the samples that I've tried wearing and holy shit this is wonderful! Lavander is one of the absolute top scent notes for me and this is such a masterful blend that lavander stars in. Yet another thing on the list of shit I've gotta get my hands on a full bottle of.

I'll have to see how it goes the next few shaves. Noble Otter killed it as always, if I kill a tub it will be this one just because I love it so much.\n\n",

Great shave. Working from home this AM so I thought I would try one of the remaining CL EdT samples that I have not yet used. My first impression of Rose Santal is very positive. It's easy to catch that rose note and the similarity with YRP on that front, but then it dries down to be a bit darker and fits better with colder weather. Thus far, I think YRP and Rose Santal are the two CL EdTs that will eventually warrant a 30ml purchase.\n\nUse 16 on this blade, still going strong. Happy shaves, all!",

Today is much different.\n\nI decided back in December that I was finally going to kill a soap, and that I wouldn't buy ANY new soap until I did so. This is a big deal, since I've never even encountered the ring of death. I settled on Visions and Revisions due to the fact that it was the only soap I had that had a noticeable dip in the amount.\n\nFast forward around a month, I've used it almost exclusively with the few odd exceptions where I just wanted something different. The dip in the soap has gotten much more noticeable.\n\nPerhaps using the new Dogclaration brush is helping. I haven't picked up any other brush (traditionally used synthetics) since receiving it.\n\nHope you everyone has a good one.\n\nCheers",

I think it's time to start working through those. The performance is always excellent, but sometimes their scents are on the weak side. We'll see which ones are allowed to grow up and become full tubs!\n\n## Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Gillette - Single Ring 1904 ::: Gillette - Nacet ‹111 uses›)*\n\nmore of a 45 degree angle is needed and it keeps it nice and smooth.\n\nI think this razor might be able to handle the Nacet at this age! Comfort is sure there, but I want to monitor the closeness I'm able to get.\n\nNo tugging or irritation at all.\n\n## Soap Notes\n*^(Mystic Water Soaps - Barbershop)*\n\nUse 2.5 tps water next time for 1/4 tsp soap. Amount of lather was good. This wasn't too thin, but it was on the bottom end for me; I wouldn't want to go thinner.\n\nVery slick as it was though. Wonderful feeling rinses after each pass.\n\nScent strength: 2/10. Pretty much not noticeable during the shave :-(\n\nBut when I buried my nose in the bowl, I did enjoy what I got. A nice barbershop scent she has here. Will make someone who likes mild scents or has sensitivities a happy person.\n\n\n## Brush Notes\n*^(Semogue - 1305)*\n\nbrush is very nice, even with just a few uses. Tips are gently scrubby right now, but will get more luxurious with time. Splay is right at where it should be already. I do keep soaking my boars lately for a few hours before each shave. I guess it is working.\n\n## Shave Quality\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Smooth\n*Neck*: Smooth\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Few hairs are showing some tip length (with most being cut flush)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm)\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

I used it regularly the first few months, and at the time I was still in the habit of \"blooming\" my soaps (per Nick Shaves' tutorial) which I think only depletes it faster. So after moving on to a bunch of other soaps, this is still the most depleted in my den. I don't reach for the scent that often, but the performance (esp residual slickness) is very nice, and I think there's a good chance this one will get finished in 2019. After yesterday's shit-show with that Vie Long, I went back to using my favorite brush today. Much better experience.",

Ive still yet to try the AGGR plate, but this one is great! I think one of the things I like is the giant vents(?) that allow the lather and shorn stubble to go right on through, and not clog. It just rinsed right through no muss no fuss. Can't beat that with a stick!\n\nIt is moderate temp here today, so why not Grand Valley Vetiver. Great lather, great post, great stuff!\n\nI have no idea how many shaves are on the blade, but it's at least a few weeks worth, and it's still as smooth as silk. I predict I will toss it prematurely in favor of trying the AGGR plate soon. I still have remnants of a mustache, so I'm torn between seeing if the MILD plate is up to snuff, of if I should bring in the big guns and use the AGGR plate.\n\nDFS today and I smell good to boot!\n\nHappy shaving all!!!",

I love the scent of Davy Jones so much, I need to get a full tub of this soon. I also decided to forego a splash today, which actually was kinda nice. Used the scuttle because I didn't have to go into work until like noon today, so taking my time was awesome.\n\nHappy Shaves Y'all!",

I love this straight-up grapefruit offering from the geniuses at Southern Witchcrafts. Very strong scent, maybe a 7 or 8. Grapefruit all up in your face. Followed up by trusty Stirling. This is my go-to splash for any citrus-y soap that I don't have the corresponding splash for. Executive Man EdT topped the whole thing off well. Fuck yeah. Good smellz.\n\n*Regarding the song:* This song is godddamn hilarious to me. The delivery itself and the instrumentals are amusing on their own but these lyrics...I know they are supposed to be all metaphoric and shit but it's too funny. *Triangle Man, Triangle Man. Triangle Man hates Particle Man. They have a fight; Triangle wins. Triangle Man.* Like. Who is this Triangle Man?! How is he this unstoppable force that not even Universe Man or Person Man can best? What in the fuck does it all even mean?!\n\n*Gah.*",

Mostly because it was and is the soap i have been using the most since october and still cant notice any big diffefence in the tub. That is both warming and depressing. Warm that it was such a great buy, a lovely soap that will last forever. Depressing because i would like to finish a tub of soap someday. Only done it once, would like to do again.\n\nSo what now? Yes! Seville! Earlier i have not used it since while it smelled good it did not feel good enough. It is by far the most hyoed soap i have stumpled upon. Lots of praise everywhere. So now i try it imstead of waiting.\n\nAnd the results are: as expected. A nice soap. Works like a charm. Just like cologne russe (since both are of the same Glissant soap base). And scentwise: smells good but i think the hype of it has made me feel a bit expecting something life changing. I did not. But still, if cologne russe someday will die, seville is a good contender to take its place!",

This is my first try of CB luxury base and it's hard to believe that this is a vegan base. I've tried a few samples of other vegan soaps that I wasn't a big fan of in the past, but very few honestly seem to pass the muster in my opinion. Perhaps I'm biased. Oh, and as for the scent, it's really hard to describe. The ladies in my house weren't big fans of it directly out of the bottle or off the soap yesterday, but they love it now that I'm wearing it. Seriously wonderful stuff here! Happy Friday folks!!",

The aftershave only made things worse as the menthol continued to increase with intensity. I had a frosty face for the rest of the night and tears may have been shed but it did a heck of a job clearing the sinuses so I have no regrets.\n\nI still have about 2-3 shaves left on the Reserve Fern sample and I've started to get used to it now.

Leviathan is definitely in my Top 5 shaving scents. I think my technique is finally getting good enough that I can get a really close shave even with a mild setup. With ATG shaving everyday, I think I want to go with the mildest option I can while maintaing the standard I want out of a shave.",

Also tried my Blue B5 with an o-ring for the first time ... worked really well.\n\n## Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Gillette - Single Ring 1904 ::: Gillette - Nacet ‹112 uses›)*\n\nSuch a smooth razor. Very good shave. But even though I buffed for a bit at the end, there were a few stubborn hairs that escaped. But still a quality shave.\n\nBut the joint between the handle tube and the top piece started to loosen a little. I may have to stop using this one until I learn how to glue this guy back together.\n\n## Soap Notes\n*^(Mystic Water Soaps - Leather & Smoke)*\n\nExcellent performance as usual from MWS.\n\n1/4+ tsp soap + 2.5 tsp water + several sprays of water = 5-6 passes of lather. And it was superbly slick. Feels great on the face.\n\nScent was as you would expect, with priority given to the leather scent, which I liked.\n\nStrength was 4/10, lightly present during shave. It smelled more intense in the ziplock (this was a sample). I wished for it to be a little stronger.\n\n\n## Brush Notes\n*^(Declaration Grooming - B5 24mm Badger Blue Handle)*\n\nMy first time trying this brush with an o-ring I got off Amazon. The loft on this one is to high because of the handle I put it in. But the o-ring shaved the day and it felt great.\n\n## Shave Quality\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Smooth\n*Neck*: Smooth\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Few hairs are showing some tip length (with most being cut flush)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm)\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

The oblivious, clumsy dude standing next to me accidentally blasted me with Georgio Armani Acqua di Gio. Had to smell that all day. I was going to try out some Stirling Soap Dunshire, but after soaking in the real thing for a day I'm not so sure any more.\n\nI'm loving this Wilkinson / Super Speed combo. It's efficient enough for my embarrassingly sparse non-beard, but mild enough that there is no irritation or blood as long as I pay attention to what I'm doing instead of running on autopilot.",

Had a pretty good lather today. I am one of those fools who actually thought Latha was a great base. Limon - is one of my favorite scents - it is nice and simple and I love it. I 'bloomed' the soap for about 45 seconds, started with more wet than dry brush and ended up with a close to great lather. No problem completing 3 full passes.\n\nCharcoal Goods LVL2 is probably my third favorite DE of all time - Personna Red is an interesting match for this razor. I would consider this blade a 3 or 4 in a scale of sharpness (1 to 10). This combo doesn't probably give me the closest shave without some effort and buffing, but the shave is really smooth. Used alum after the shave and no burn - pretty happy with that.\n\nLooking forward to the weekend and playoff games.",

Itll be between stainless and PTFE coated. I cant deal with the rust the carbon blades acquire so I'll stray from those.\n\nI've really had an interesting time figuring out which blade angle works for me while using the more rigid SE blades but have come down to a couple that work. On my less sensitive areas I can lean towards a bigger angle with no irritation but in a couple areas, specifically my upper lip and under my chin, I prefer to almost ride the top plate of the razor.\n\nOverall, a very comfortable shave while listening to my favorite comedy podcast.",

He's been turning beautiful resin brushes in custom shapes named after animals, and donating to animal conservation. He recently began releasing a limited amount of his hand-tied dense badger knots, and plans to make them officially available sometime in the next month or so. This Blood River color is absolutely gorgeous, and the finish is impeccable. There is no coin, rather the logo is laser engraved on the brush. The overall presentation is absolutely top tier. This knot is comparable to Declaration in density, with soft tips and more backbone than my B2, B5, or B6. In all a beautiful brush that anyone would be proud to own. Big thanks to my friend Eric for letting me try this brush.\n\nThere is always a lot of chatter when Scott announces a new batch of badger knots, as their relative qualities vary. B7 did not disappoint. I found that it has more backbone than the other batches I've tried, with soft tips that will undoubtedly split and become impossibly soft. The loft is higher than other Declarations I have, which balances out the backbone and density of this knot. I think if you've been on the fence about B7, you don't need to worry. It was an absolute joy to use.",

No, I didn't spend $1k on the brush. Yes, I've spent $1,000 on a Gillette razor in the past but haven't entered this realm for brushes.\n\nSo here's the story...I got a Jefferson Goldmember in the last drop. During the process of making the brush somehow it explodes and that brush is no longer a viable option of knotting. Scott gets in touch with me and asks if I care that it's switched out to a Teddy shape instead. No big deal to me, I prefer the Teddy shape anyway. Some wires get crossed between us and instead of going with the new B7 which had just been released we revert back to B6. There you have it the story of the B6 Goldmember Teddy.",

Really enjoy using the Single Rings.\n\n2nd shave where I've started to use a spray bottle to add water to either my brush or my face, after I've built my lather, in case it needs more hydration. Works really well.\n\n## Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Gillette - Old Type Single Ring 1917 ::: Gillette - Nacet ‹113 uses›)*\n\nDidn't quite get my trouble spot like I'm used to, but a good shave anyway. Lather so slick.\n\nI'm going to switch back to my Sheraton and see how the efficiency goes after that.\n\n## Soap Notes\n*^(Mystic Water Soaps - Vetiver & Oakmoss)*\n\n1/4+ tsp soap + 4 tsp water + a few sprays = 5-6 passes of super-slick lather.\n\nScent reminded me of Tabac.\n\nStrength was maybe 5/10, and was available during the shave. But not quite my style.\n\n\n## Brush Notes\n*^(Omega - 10098)*\n\nstill prickly, but is still early in the break-in.\n\n## Shave Quality\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Few hairs are showing some tip length (with most being cut flush)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm)\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

This was a sample that I was using. The scent is amazing, just a really bright and in your face scent. Strength was probably around a 6 or 7 I'd say. Slickness was good, residual was average. I was surprised in it's ability to create volume as a vegan base, it got as voluminous as what I can normally only do with tallow soaps. Overall a solid soap!\n\nUnfortunately I believe GSBs are not for me. Which I guess proves YMMV. I see a lot of people that love them and say they are smooth but to my skin I get a lot of nicks and it feels harsh. Astra remains at the top\n\nHappy shaves y'all",

Very glad I picked it up. The soap smells a little better than the aftershave to me though, it seems the aftershave puts out a little more of the Yuzu. Regardless, I'm definitely a fan. I'm loving this B6 knot, so damn luxurious and no brush burn this time so very happy about that. Only it's second use so I'm looking forward to this knot breaking in even more. Also, Icarus is definitely the most luxurious soap base on the planet. This shit is so good and my face is so soft.\n\nI have some HUGE news that I can't wait to share in a couple weeks :)",

Usually when I try to go ATG on my neck, I get a decent amount of irritation, but today, instead of using my arms to move my razor, I just moved my head with way less pressure than usual, and it was just phenomenal.\n\nAs always, WK KoB is just incredible stuff. Top of the Top tier for me, though I still need to try both the Icarus base from DG and pretty much all the bases from B&M.\n\nHappy Shaves Y'all and Go Waves!",

Not only did the Chatty Lux order I placed the first week of December finally show up (full credit to u/hawns (go show love in his AMA!) for re-shipping after the USPS \"misplaced\" the original), but my new-to-me razor (thanks u/Hyvasuomi79) arrived a day early.\n\nThis morning, I decided it was time to try out a bunch of my new stuff. After a hot shower (during which I let the new broosh have a good soak in warm water), I lathered up the old noggin and gave it a scrape.\n\nSince it was a head shave, I don't have a lot to report about the quality of the B7 knot. It certainly held a lot of water and heat, and seemed to have a fair amount of backbone, but my scalp just isn't as good at judging gelly softness as my face.\n\nI was a little nervous about using the new razor for a head shave because I'm just going by feel and sound on the back of my head and I haven't had any time to get used to the razor and its angles. The dimensions of the handle and head were nearly identical to those of my post-war fat handle Tech, which I used for 2 weeks straight over the holiday break, and the angle of attack must be very similar as well. As soon as I picked up the razor, muscle memory took over and I got a great 2-pass shave with no nicks, cuts, scrapes, or irritation. The CB is noticeably heavier than my tech, which is kind of nice. I think I'm really going to enjoy this razor.\n\nThe soap performed wonderfully, as you'd expect from DG's bison base. I went light on the splash because Darkfall can be a bit overpowering and I wanted to let my nose focus on the GLS (which I don't think I've ever smelled before).\n\nTryThatSoap predicts that I'll score GLS as a 3.99, which is somewhere between \"this is nice, I enjoy it\" (about 3.5) and \"this is what heaven smells like, I must hoard it\" (at about 4.5). So far, I'm really enjoying the GLS. I'm getting mostly a light leather note floating on a river of more creamy/powdery sweetness with just a bit of something more animal musky at the very edge. We'll see what the wife says when she wakes up.\n\nHave a great weekend, folks!\n\nUpdate: The wife says GLS is nice, smells vaguely of a bakery, and is making her hungry.",

First time using my TSM Fougere soap that I just picked up in a trade to match my splash. I liked it quite a bit. The bison base is fantastic. However, my wife was not a fan of the scent. Apparently I forgot that she didn't really like the splash haha. She seems like a total wild card when it comes to scents. For example, she loves Lamplight Penance--she seriously can't get enough--which I did not expect at all.\n\nI got a fantastic lather today. Probably the best I've gotten from this brush. I went for the \"more\" approach today--more soak time (10ish minutes while I showered), more loading, more water. My lather is usually pretty weak by my third pass, but this gave me enough for 3 plus touch-ups, and I still had some left over.\n\nWent to the mall with my wife today and wandered over to my brick and mortar wet shave retailer. Snagged their last Roam EdT and couldn't resist trying it out even though the scents do not match at all haha. Now I have the Roam splash and EdT, but I still don't have the soap. Anyone have a recommendation on a soap to pair them with?",

It was still mild,but I did see a small rise in aggression. I think the two really complenmented each other.\n\nI bought this soap a couple weeks ago and it's just been sitting around, so I decided to give it a try. It was a very slick lather, and while it didn't provide a ton of cushion there was enough to shave comfortably. The post shave was just remarkable with this stuff, which was the part I didn't expect.\n\nOverall this is just an awesome soap. I would definitely recommend you pick it up especially because the price is so low. By far the best product that van der hagen makes.\n\nI finally am through trying all the blades I ordered recently, and the ones I would be willing to use again are the Gillette platinum, treet classic, and the rapira swedish supersteel.\n",

I'll stick with this guy to handle the Nacet. No tugging and only a slight bit of razor burn near bottom of neck probably because I got careless.\n\n## Soap Notes\n*^(Mystic Water Soaps - Windjammer)*\n\nPeforormance great as usual from MWS. This one had a strength of 5/10, which was nice, but the scent borders on feminine, with some heavy florals in there. But I wouldn't mind it if this was the only soap I had on a desert island.\n\n\n## Brush Notes\n*^(Semogue - 1305)*\n\nSo few uses on this Semogue and it is performing very well already.\n\n## Shave Quality\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Few hairs are showing some tip length (with most being cut flush)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm)\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

      "body": "**My Nivea-themed non-artisan wet shave of the day:**\n\n**Razor:** 1961 Flare Tip Superspeed\n\n**Blade:** Wilkinson Sword, German (shave #12, still sharp enough for most of the face but ATG on the chin is getting kinda nasty... planning to take it to 15 shaves just to see what happens and then retire it)\n\n**Brush:** Vie Long 21mm Horse (VL-14080)\n\n**Prep:** Took a shower\n\n**Lather:** [Nivea Sensitive Skin Shaving Cream](https://www.nivea.ca/en-ca/products/sensitive-skin-shaving-cream-565940072150055.html)\n\n**Post:** [Nivea Sensitive Skin After Shave Balm](https://www.nivea.ca/en-ca/products/sensitive-skin-after-shave-balm-721408130620055.html)\n\nI spent close to a decade applying and lathering Florentine / Nivea shaving creams *by hand* before I saw a photo of what a good brush lather was supposed to look like, at which point I went \"damn, I need to get a shaving brush.\" Applied by hand, it's basically like smearing a thick cream on your face that produces some suds and bubbles here and there. Lathered up by brush [in a bowl](https://www.amazon.com/Hinomaru-Collection-Authentic-Japanese-Porcelain/dp/B07CZSM5D8), it's incredibly easy to churn out lather with a whipped cream consistency. Way easier than most soaps, I think. Just squirt an inch-long bead of cream in the bowl and start mixin' it up, adding water as necessary until it looks like whipped cream instead of pasty glue.\n\nThat said, Proraso soaps get a lot of shit on the internet for coating your gear with soap scum, but I think that the Nivea shaving creams are *much, much worse*. Proraso's lather at least dissolves into the water in your sink when you rinse your razor / clean your brush, but Nivea's lather leaves scummy clumps of foam floating on top of the water. If you don't wash that shit out of your sink after every shave, you'll end up with crusty bubbles and soap scum everywhere. Gross.\n\nOverall I'd heartily recommend the stuff to any beginner who wants a cheap ($3.50 CAD), mild-but-pleasantly-scented, easy-to-lather cream. Just stay on top of washing the sink, brush, and razor.",

Having the Big Box of Rare Samples went a long way towards curing my Bufflehead FOMO. But when the opportunity came up on Christmas day to pick up a tub from the man himself at MSRP, I couldn't click 'Buy' fast enough. I'm not sure how to describe the scent on the soap. It's clean and floral and a bit citrus-y. Honestly, it makes me think of staying in a really high-end hotel and the kinds of bath products they tend to have in the rooms.\n\nThe Christopher Bradley performed admirably on its second outing. It's just so dang easy to use.\n\nI figured I'd top the whole thing off by getting into the Omnostre sample from my Chatty Lux order. I don't really have a verdict on this scent yet beyond \"it's not what I'd normally wear.\" I may be a bit on the basic side when it comes to fragrances. I think Barrister and Mann's 42 EdT was the first EdT I ever bought and the first fragrance that wasn't just \"late 90s smelling-like-the-inserts-in-Maxim-or-Playboy-is-classy immature male stink\". But I'm trying to expand my horizons. Thanks to Dr Jon's FitD EdT, I figured out that I really like lavender (and that has led to CL's Lavander Poivre, which is really wonderful). I also love Eau de Treget and GLS wasn't half bad either. But Omnostre is a different beast. Maybe it's the vetiver. There's a pungent note that's just kind of jarring my senses and reminding me that I'm dealing with something unfamiliar. I'm glad I picked up several samples in my last CL order and I'm already putting together another cart with even more samples because CL does awesome work and smells are fun.",

This time I tried with a bowl and it turned out a lot better, since I was able to control the water additions better. I'm not sure what sandalwood is *supposed* to smell like, but I will say this is the most pleasant of the versions I have tried (I like it better than TOBS, anyway). Glad I didn't give up on this cream (a PIF from mantic59) when I initially got ho-hum results. Now maybe I'll have to give TOBS another shot with bowl lathering...",

But I continue to work through my MWS soap samples. Bay Rum today.\n\n## Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Gillette - Sheraton 1938 ::: Gillette - Nacet ‹115 uses›)*\n\nDidn't really work too hard at it. Buffed a lot on my trouble spots on a couple of the passes, but I didn't end up with a great cut after 3.5 passes. Oh well.\n\nNo tugging or irritation at all.\n\n## Soap Notes\n*^(Mystic Water Soaps - Bay Rum)*\n\n1/4 tsp soap + 4.5 tsp water = a great lather that gave me creamy rinses while being super slick. And this amount of soap gave me about 6-7 passes of lather to boot.\n\nAdded water kinda quickly this time, after the initial lather was built up enough. Worked well, it seems.\n\nvery slick.\n\nScent strength: 2-3/10. I'm actually smelling it on my face after the shave, but during... I barely noticed it at all. I had high hopes, since it seemed medium strength from the puck. But that didn't pan out.\n\nBut maybe this one is great for someone that likes bay rum, but finds most of the others out there way too strong.\n\n\n## Brush Notes\n*^(That Darn Rob - Fanchurian 28mm 2-Band)*\n\nMaybe I've put enough uses into this knot to have it soften up permanently. Wasn't able to soak it much, but it was a soft wall of badger that was enjoyable to use. Backbone is a hair more than I might like, but it is still very enjoyable.\n\n## Shave Quality\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Smooth\n*Neck*: Smooth\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Many hairs show whisker tips with a little length to them\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm)\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

This aqua de parma colonia dupe is wonderful. It's an amazing citrus scent with something I can't quite name that seems to round the whole thing out.\n\nThe canard base is the thing that I really think is underappreciated. This base holds it's own with the best of them, I even think it might perform better that quite a few bases and has a great post shave feel.\n\nThe balm is very nice as well, it's pretty much got the performance of a Stirling balm with just a slightly different viscosity. The thing that really makes me like this balm is the bottle it comes in, you get a perfect size of balm with one push of the top.\n\nThis blade was just perfect today.

Not sure if the Brazilian Nut Butter is a different base than their usual releases but it has fantastic performance. I know it is 1 of 25, so a very small release. Maybe I was just never paying that much attention before. Anyway, great scent on this one and a great shave, happy Monday!",

I've shaved with this setup multiple times, but something didn't quite click today. Possible reasons i) Thin lather because I was in a rush, ii) Time to change my blade. Can't wait for my next shave to figure out what caused this mediocre shave. Planning to keep the same blade, and concentrate on creating good lather. If it's still no good, then I'll switch the blade!",

After the rain is just so good. Performance is top notch, super slick and protective and it smells delectable. It was also an appropriate soap as it is absolutely pouring where I live in SoCal right now.\n\nThe Karve continue to be a rockstar as well. Now that I figured out how to shave my neck better, I am getting closer with less irritation than I ever have, and it makes me so happy.\n\nHappy Shaves Y'all!",

Sported a beard for a long time then mustache Van Dyke combo. Today it all came off. My bro got me the Mysterious Space Yaqi for Xmas. The knot is luxuriously soft with a nice scrubbyness and the handle is sweet. Whipped up the Jermyn St. without issue though it has been shedding a few hairs. This is only the third use; hopefully it settles down. I've been working to kill this cream as I have a few I'd like to pick up. It still has a long way to go. Maiden voyage for the 22R. I've wanted one forever but never see them on the Bazaar. Picked one up finally with an xmas ebay gift card. Mild aggression with a little bite just how I like it. Very curious to try out a Feather in it. I'm really impressed with the finish and heft of it. It's futuristic look and gun metal color go well with the Mysterious Space brush imo. First blade out of a bulk 100 I picked up. It's a little anxiety inducing when you find that blade that works then pick up the bulk pack. Will these 100 blades perform the same? Did you get a bad batch? Counterfeits? Happy to report this Platinum Lux performed flawlessly. I've had this Myrsol Blue sample for a long time. Smells like a weaker Aqua Velva Ice Blue. Not bad but doesn't do enough for me. Woo! I had a lot to say. Excellent, irritation free shave! Have a great week ya'll!",

But I figure if I don't repeat the experiment, then I'm not really doing science and science works, bitches. So I loaded up the Xmas Prime with Anne Bonny and went to work. No real issues as the Karve razor continues to perform admirably. I did discover when lathering up for my second pass that I had underloaded at the start, so pass 2 had a bit of a thin lather coat. On this second go round, the Anne Bonny splash did not, in fact, light me up. So either my face is far more sensitive than my scalp or my technique was just way off on the previous AB shave and any splash would have lit me up or some third option that I have yet to think of. Whatever, clearly another test is warranted.\n\nContinuing to work my way through my CL mail call from last week, I'm trying out Taum Sauk today. My initial impression is that it is a pleasant, clean scent. I'm not sure that I'm necessarily transported to a cedar-covered mountain top when I inhale, but I definitely get a vibe of clean, clear air and green. And now that I look, it appears I've fallen into a pattern of placing monthly orders from Chatillon Lux... Nov, Dec, yesterday... And it's just going to continue when Sni Mato drops on the first of February. I once said that Will was surpassing George Lucas as the human being most able to cause money to disappear from my wallet, but I think hawns may be passing him up. That said, my year-end \"oh my glob, what have I done?\" financial retrospective indicates that I have sent more stacks of doll hairs to Declaration than any other two (probably 3) artisans combined.",

I was very pleasantly surprised by this one. First go and it's probably up there with my top blades already. I've been soaking the Semogue and there is a noticable difference, but for me I think synthetics are king at making a lather. Still good, not amazing. I smell amazing, love kaboom\n\nHappy shaves everyone\n\nEdit: cant shave without a razor",

Art of Noise - Kiss](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uZQFOfMSfY)\n\nIt had been several months since I used this set. Forgot about the menthol in the splash and so that was a bit of a surprise. Excellent shave though. The donkey milk base feels incredible on my skin and this Parker blade is feeling fantastic.\n\nStarting with Tempest, my next shaves are all going to be /r/wetshaving exclusives. Time for a tour. I currently own seven.\n\n/u/smumustang just posted [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/ag659p/gillettes_new_commercial_targeting_men_sends_a/) thread. I found it a pretty decent ad. Thought it warranted a crosspost. Or I will get many downvotes. And that is okay.\n\nWe are just over two weeks into the New Year. [How are we looking?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/ab8bix/new_years_resolutions/)\n\nQuick note on the frag: finally got to try EMP and the pineapple note is very strong here. It's mostly all I get but don't take my nose for it; it has all the sophistication of a horny and hungry caveman. Give me original Executive Man or give me...something else.\n\nAlso, this version of *Kiss* kicks the shit out of what Prince did. RIP and all and mad respect and whatnot and I know it's his song but listen to this. It's so over the top and it makes me laugh every single time.\n\nGood day, gentlemen. Take no quarter.",

I try another MWS soap: Oatmeal Stout.\n\n## Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Gillette - Sheraton 1938 ::: Gillette - Nacet ‹116 uses›)*\n\nGreat result today, once I took a little more against-the-grain aspect to my trouble spot in the 4th inning.\n\nNo tugging, and only minimal irritation (that was easily dispelled by balm).\n\n## Soap Notes\n*^(Mystic Water Soaps - Oatmeal Stout)*\n\nGreat performance as usual from MWS. This was a super slick, well-hydrated mix.\n\n1/4 tsp soap + 4 tsp water + small boar brush = just the right amount of lather.\n\nscent strength: 3-4/10. Lightly present during shave. A very easy-going, slightly sweet scent.\n\n\n## Brush Notes\n*^(Semogue - 1250)*\n\nWonderful little brush is breaking in quickly. I'm soaking it for a few hours before each shave and I think I like that. Medium low backbone makes shaving very soft. Can't wait till the tips split more.\n\n## Shave Quality\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Cut flush to where I just see the tips (above average for me)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm)\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

Also, the cream had a nice amount of fatty feel and some of it remained after rinsed. I might have over watered it, but it will still very slick and performed without issue.\n\nIt's already ready for prime time as it's at least as good as other creams out there (and much much better than some popular ones) , but I know this isn't final version. Overall, I'm very pleased with it.",

It's always a bit of a bummer when an artisan folds up shop, but there are many others cropping up all the time. It's a good time to be a wetshaver.\n\nThis 24mm fan seems more like a 26mm. I went a little overboard with the loading. I had quite an excess amount of lather. It was falling off the brush onto the floor and sink. First world problem.\n\nOff to work.\n\nEdit: I forgot to mention that I won this salve in the big 10K PIF. It's pretty nice. It doesn't take much at all. Just a tiny dab will do it. Thanks again to all the PIF organizers and contributors.",

Cody asks for a full list of feedback that I'll definitely be willing to give him after I use it at least one more time. This is my first cream that I've used in five-ever and it honestly wasn't a bad experience. I'm glad that I caught myself and shook my brush out pretty decently before I started lathering it. Didn't wanna drown it from the get go. It's relatively thirsty for a cream, if that makes sense. Anyway, I'll be lathering it by hand tomorrow, so we'll see how that goes.\n\nOh and I snagged my first TF decant from r/fragsplits and it's definitely a winner! If you like Oud, you'll like Oud Wood. Really makes me almost wish I wouldn't have traded my WK King of Oud away so long ago, but there's no use crying over spilled milk. Happy Tuesday everybody!",

Said he used his '40s Superspeed that I got him for Christmas to shave that morning. I asked if he had used a Feather (his usual blade) and he said, \"Yeah, I think it's probably 6 or 7 shaves old so it's not super sharp any more, but I still only needed one pass. Really smooth shave.\"\n\nAnyway, I was floored. He has the thickest beard I've ever seen, and it was easily one of the best shaves I've ever seen on his face. Reminded me that I still need to put in a lot of practice to nail down the right razor angle on my neck so that my first pass catches the majority of the whiskers. Checks and moustache? Sure, I could 1-pass those and get away with it. Neck? Frig, I swear I don't even touch the whiskers with the blade half the time.\n\nFocused a little more on razor angle today and it helped. Still a ways to go, but definitely better results than my last shave.\n\nI am looking forward to the weekend! I should have about 9 Stirling soap samples and a couple Gillette Techs showing up... my first foray out of the mall soaps and into artisan soaps ever. Should be fun.",

Shave takes 15 mins rather than the old three pass 21 minutes, and the extra 6 minutes are most welcome in the AM. Interestingly, this combo works better for me than a Poli in a Paradigm Ti. The Bolzanos are awful in the Paradigm, and even the Poli occasionally gives me \"birdshot neck\". Dare I say the relatively humble S1 (for me) is a better shaver? (Very relative, as the S1 is hardly a budget item, but still half the price of the Ti).\n\n* Soap: Though the move may remind some of Star Wars 5 (2?), when the Empire hires Boba Fett in the course of Striking Back, the best thing about WCS to me is that they have now \"hired\" Grooming Department, so that the supply of GD products is reasonably stabilized. This nameless soap (has ingredients but not a product title on it) has an awesome scent and amazing semi-vegan performance. GD soaps definitely need more exposure, and hopefully their stockage by the Evil Empire will achieve this goal. Good technical and scent design deserves props, even if the dude does wear a funny looking helmet. Now if this all ends with Brad Maggard frozen in carbonite, I may rethink, but for now, I am glad that Mohammed and WCS have found each other...\n\n* Frag: In keeping with the Evil Empire theme, am wearing Vlad Putin's favorite scent today. Powder and flowers work well together, especially for the KGB.",

The fragrance is mild-to-mid, and slightly fills the space while lathering, and reminds me of another scent - is it YSL Rive Gauche pour Homme? Maybe, I'll have to check the notes later, but it smells like a clean barbershop frag that you could wear indoors or outdoors every day. Loading and releasing lather from the brush was easy, and the thirsty & \"high-structure\" lather had decent slickness, although it dried quicker than my top tier soaps and post-shave was also dry. Part of this may have been due to my lathering or amount/hardness of water used.\n\nOverall, shave was decent and the really nice fragrance is still on the skin. Looking forward to shaving daily again, seeing more from this artisan, and exploring more of the new releases from our favorite artisans & other new artisans in 2019.",

I thing I don't like is, posting my SOTD on wicked edge when I decide to use proraso, the reaction to it is less than welcoming. But, hey, fuck em. I like the stuff.\n\nJust a nice shave tonight. For those that don't know Kai blades are actually slightly larger than most by a mm. So the blades themselves while decently sharp, actually make whatever razor they are put in slightly more aggressive.\n\nSo if you're ever wondered what a slightly more aggressive tech would be like, it really reminded me of the shave I get from my trusty old de89. I'll just save the rest of these for the day I want to up the aggressiveness of something else.",

It was at various lengths from the barber shop and I just could not take the itchy feeling anymore. I got my first full facial of winter when I stepped outside without the beard. It was quite chilly.\n\nTechnique was smooth for my first full shave in a long time and that Icarus/chat lux combo is just amazing on the face. Already looking forward to the beard growing back.\n\nHappy Wednesday!",

I haven't realized until this morning just how much the ritual of the steps with soaking my brush and grabbing the soap and loading the brush and so on had really become second nature until today. Shaving without those steps, just felt weird and wrong lol. As for the lather itself, I think I'll need more practice at forming a useful lather with just my hands, but it was passable. I think I'll do it one more time tomorrow and take a break from the cream.",

Took a little different strategy on directional strokes this time and it really paid off!\n\n## Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Gillette - Sheraton 1938 ::: Gillette - Nacet ‹117 uses›)*\n\nUsual shave with this old blade... pulling just a little bit only during the first pass, then the rest are smooth. but this time on the touch-up pass, I attacked from a different direction, with a slant stroke and, while it didn't feel all that smooth, it gave me a super flush cut, right in my trouble-spot-adam's-apple-adjacent area. Only a tiny bit of irritation... but balm easily fixed it.\n\n## Soap Notes\n*^(Mystic Water Soaps - Egyptian Dragon)*\n\nGreat perf as usual. But this one had more of a strong scent than the others, which was refreshing. It was still kinda mild, though, objectively speaking. I'd say a 4-5/10. Kinda interesting scent. Well blended. Not overbearing.\n\nThe usual ratio of 1/4 tsp soap + 4.5 tsp water + boar brush = a wonderfully slick lather that protected well. Great luxurious rinses, while being well-hydrated.\n\nPaired well with PDP 63 balm, IMO.\n\n\n## Brush Notes\n*^(Omega - 10098)*\n\nGetting softer, but not quite soft yet. A little pokey still. Expanding as well, but very slowly. Soaked it for a few hours prior to shave to maybe help speed up the break-in.\n\n## Shave Quality\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm)\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

Perfect, BBS on 4 passes including an ATG pass. That's what I love about this razor-one of the first razors I've ever used that gets me perfect BBS with no irritation even with an ATG pass.

Haven't experienced that much discomfort since I first startes DE shaving, if ever. Technique leaves much to be desired, but I'm a stubborn s.o.b, so these literal growing pains won't deter me. Seems like a very rewarding way to shave once you get the hang of it.\n\nIf any seasoned straight shavers have advice on what helped them most when they started, or resources they recommend for learning, I'm all ears.

It had been 3 days since I shaved, and it was driving me crazy. I got excited seeing some of you guys getting your 10k PIF in, and I wanted to wait for mine to come in to shave with it, but I just couldn't take it.\n\nNo-nonsense shave as always with this combo. It's become my go-to when I don't know what I want. I also used my scuttle (Georgetown G12 Second) because it was pretty cold by SoCal standards since its been raining. It is such a treat when I have time, but it is definitely less convenient than my usual face lather.\n\nHappy Shaves Y'all!",

There is a little more blade feel, but still smooth as silk. I had a perfectly acceptable shave at 2 passes, but I went for the three pass. I couldn't think of a better way to give this rig it's maiden voyage. BBS on my face and just a little closer on my problem areas. I could have probably gotten BBS no problem, but DO NOT want ingrown, which is easy to happen when I get too close there. It's not so much instant ingrown, but I have to maintain the closeness...that's when I get the ingrown hairs, not maintaining the closeness.\n\nAnyhow, phenomenal shave today. I couldn't be happier with this set. I get a little closer with the Ti using *both* plates that with the Stainless, which is weird to me. They have identical geometry.\n\nHave a great hump day everyone!",

Got a really good shave. I think I can get it a little closer once I figure it out more. It's a beautiful piece, and I didn't have any issues with the fat handle. I found it surprisingly grippy.\n\nMan, Noble Otter is great and this scent is awesome. It is a fantastic woodsy scent that brings me home. Overall, I'm a big fan. The scent notes they released for Two Kings today (yesterday?) sound awesome too, and I'm planning to pick it up.",

I had been waiting couple days for this shave because I know that shaving too frequently irritates my skin. Anyways, a lovely shave that was.\n\nDeclaration Grooming Original is one of my favorite soaps. Slick, creamy, and easy to lather. I choose to use it for the fine occasions.\n\nRazor and Blade works okay although I did have a slight tugging and irritation. The Lord razor is a bit rougher than others such as EJ89 but I'll try out other blades to see. Maybe a sharper one like Voshkod.\n\nAlum and Stirling Balm always works amazing. Keeps my skin nice and tight and moisturized. The scent on the Balm is okay but it does remind me of a sunscreen smell. I want to try the soap scent later on.\n\nOverall, a great shave to start off the day!",

The stainless were my favorite from them last time so I decided to test one of those first. In my superspeed it was way to mild. It didn't feel like I had a blade in at all. which may sound like a good thing, but it makes me have to consiously make an effort to not press down.\n\nJust like before I wasn't really impressed. Astra blades are mediocre, and so was this shave. My skin didn't get irritated, but it wasn't a close shave at all.\n\nMy new proraso pro boar bristle is broken in more than the one I had before already. I've been soaking it, leaving lather in it,and rubbing it on a towel constant, and that work has paid off. These brushes are really great, for those that haven't used one, don't let the proraso name fool you, these are some great boar brushes that are made by Omega. I highly recommend it, especially for the price.",

A lot of stiffness in the neck and hard to rotate. Hoping it is nothing major.\n\nHappy Thursday",

Have to get creative since /u/olympiawest refuses to make the world a better place by giving us aftershave. :)",

Uh oh. I guess... hmm. Okay. I really enjoy the way my blue Gillette goop smells. Sort of like a more vibrant Drakkar Noir, not quite as dark and smooth... That's... about as slutty as I can make my shave, I think. Oh! I shaved after my shower, *before I got dressed* (pumps eyebrows a few times). I guess shaving naked would be slutty, right? Right? I'm not struggling to meet the theme today, right?\n\nAnyway, real talk:\n\nProraso has to make the worst lather of any soap I own. Sure, load up the brush good, put a beginning lather together, it works. It's quick. But I feel like I can't push it any further without it just breaking down into suds really quickly. Maybe it's the water where I live.\n\nOn top of that, I think it's the least slick soap I've ever used. It feels like there isn't even any lather on my face as I try to drag the razor across the skin... it's very hard to get a satisfactory shave with the razor head dragging so much against the skin.\n\nYet somehow, zero razor burn or nicks or cuts or weepers at the end of the shave. That gives me such mixed feelings about this soap. Could I keep using it if I had to? Yeah. Do I have better alternatives, though? Also yeah. Might be time to PIF this to a buddy because the soap he uses is even worse.",

It's such a slight burn but I enjoy the pain. Always follow it up with a menthol AS to cool me off.\n\nThe Gillette pocket isn't a terrible shave but it most definately isn't my favorite. It gets the job done and it looks so damn good even though it's in user grade condition. I quite honestly love this razors look. Its beat up and it's been through some shit but I got it back up and running. I prefer to use a new blade with this razor but I want to run my Sharp blade through every razor I own and I had this and an 1920s old type left to do. This blade seems to have a nice longevity at near peak performance but at its peak it still doesnt quite compare to a few other blades I use.",

See below for a preview of the scent description.\n\n----------\n\nThe lyrics to the popular song \"My Funny Valentine\" were written by Larry Hart, a man described by one writer as \"a compellingly lonely figure\" with a \"conviction that he was physically too unattractive to be lovable\". No doubt the song's famous lines \"your looks are laughable, unphotographable, yet you're my favorite work of art\" were the words he wished someone would sing to him.\n\nPerhaps the song has endured because deep down we all relate to that desire for acceptance. There's something deeply warm and relaxing about the idea that we can be accepted and loved despite our flaws.\n\nLarry Hart never found what he was looking for, struggling with depression and alcoholism til his death. Singer Mabel Mercer famously called him the saddest man she ever knew.\n\nBe gentle with yourself this Valentine's Day, and be gentle with the people in your life. We're most unlovable when we need love the most.\n\nNotes for Funny Valentine are strawberry, currant, rose, neroli, amber, cognac, and howood. It's jammy and warm, the sweetness of the fruit balanced by dry rose, spicy amber, and a warm woody base.",

      "body": "Thursday SOTD 1/17/19\n\nTheme: Work network kept me from looking up the deets on today's theme. I went with a despised soap to get the low end of sluttiness, and an elegant, refined, and pricey Euro brush to cover the high end of slutdom. Am I on target here? Dunno. But the deed is done.\n\n* Razor: ATT S1 w Atlas handle\n* Blade: Bolzano (3)\n* Soap: Grooming Dept After The Fire (beef / duck tallow hybrid)\n* Brush: Muhle STF V2, 25mm.\n* Post: PSC Caffeinated After Shave Cream\n* Frag: Azzaro PH EDT\n\n* Product Notes:\n\n* Soap: An excellent performer from a controversial artisan. This one feels like a mature product - ingredient label branding, nicely done art, name of the scent on it. The scent is clever - barbershop and smoke - and technical performance is quite good, though maybe not quite as good as GD's all duck tallow. Better than the vegan donkey milk, maybe roughly the same as the lamb tallow one. Does promiscuity in designing bases make one a slut? Anyway. I wish GD would trim their line a bit; avoids the bad feelings from liking Scent A in Base Line 1 and wishing it was instead offered in Base Line 2 instead.\n\n* Brush: Like a fancy prostitute who discusses Kant and Voltaire with one before proceeding with business, the Muhle STF avoids the overly visceral sensations that some brush users seek. Not quite mushy cuddling, certainly no harsh scrubbing or firm backbone, the Muhle STF occupies an odd middle ground that some customers might find unmemorable. It has grown on me. But then I like Kant also...\n\n* Frag: I picked this huge bottle of Azzaro PH up on AMZ for maybe $15 about 3 years ago. The same scent in the same size now sells for $85 on Amazon. Someone is catting around there for sure!",

In hindsight I should have stuck with what I knew and used my 6S.\n\nS1 will take some getting used to. Used too much pressure on my jaw line which caused some irritation and weepers.\n\nAll in all, was an okay first shave but happy to have my routine again!",

Tried another MWS sample: good scent, but light.\n\n## Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Gillette - Sheraton 1938 ::: Gillette - Nacet ‹118 uses›)*\n\nTugged just a little, which is par for the course these days. But shave ended up great, with no irritation and even my trouble spots being cut pretty flush.\n\n## Soap Notes\n*^(Mystic Water Soaps - Poggio dei Pini)*\n\nBlah Blah... great base as usual. Excellent performance.\n\nThis was a nice, masculine, generic scent blend, but was just barely noticeable during the shave. Scent strength 3-ish/10.\n\nThe usual 1/4 tsp soap + 3.75 tsp water + small boar brush = plenty of lather for 3.5 passes. Very slick and slightly on the hydrated side of creamy.\n\n\n## Brush Notes\n*^(Semogue - 1305)*\n\nDue to work last night,this guy ended up soaking for about 14 hours instead of just a few. Might really help to break it in.\n\nWas such a good performer today that I may not do any more break in shortcuts on it. Soft and just the right amount of backbone.\n\n## Shave Quality\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Cut flush to where I just see the tips (above average for me)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm)\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

I was a really stupid kid, let's start with that. I'd had a PS2 on my mind for a while, and maybe I was expecting to get it for Christmas, but I didn't own it yet. However, I recall that I went to the store to buy a spare controller for it, that way I had enough and wouldn't have to buy it later. I bought one that was translucent-blue, and I only noticed when I unwrapped the thing that it said PSone on it. Yes, I unwrapped it and had no console to plug it into, in fact I feel like I had it for months before I even got the PS2. I didn't return it, I just crossed my fingers that it would be compatible. So fast forward to me having the dang PS2, I go to play with it using my blue controller and I didn't notice much of a difference, except sometimes the analog light wouldn't light up automatically. I was excited, and it got some decent use because my brother was still around and played some games with me. If there was an issue, I'd clearly forgotten about it.\n\nFast forward to 2019. I got hit with a big burst of nostalgia so I brought up the trusty PS2 slim that replaced my old, broken one, and my blue PSone controller. For the life of me, the black PS2 controller couldn't be found. No worries, right? It just means I can't play split screen, which my wife made clear she had no interest. Well, my library is a shell of what it used to be, I think I gave away a lot of them simply because of all the moving I did the past 6 years, it was stupid to me to carry around a big box full of plastic game cases of games I rarely played. I've had the urge to play some Burnout 3: Takedown as it was one of my favorites. First thing I notice is the intro playing some awful song targeted to teenagers, so I desperately try to skip it. Nothing happens. X, Start, if there was a button, I pushed it. I finish the cringy intro song with my wife in the background, and now I get to the menu, and still can't do anything. This stupid-ass PSone controller prevented me from reliving my nostalgia! Well, instead of that, maybe I'll play the second game, because that was pretty sweet too. Nope. Gone, along with the sequel. They're probably out in a landfill somewhere in Mexico.\n\nIn the end, I played some SSX3, which was pretty sweet, but wasn't nearly as sweet as pushing cars into oncoming traffic and getting points for it. Add to that that I played the heck out of some Katamari Damaci the weeks before, so maybe I still am the real winner.\n\nLife is short, shave with good gear, and screw PSone controllers.\n\n\n",

I've been loving using icarus base and I'm blooming it just like Nick taught me. First use on the new brush and while I love the handle shape the knot felt a little scratchy, almost like it needs to be broken in some. Maybe I just pressed a little hard because I'm not use to the new smaller handle since this is my first theo. Regardless, I got an excellent shave. Two passes with the AA plate has been my jam lately, so smooth and no irritation. My face is soft and I'm ready for the fucking weekend. Let's just fast forward like 13 hours so I can be home sipping on some Pendleton pls.",

I literally started a week ago, so I have some basic stuff and some slightly cooler stuff, particularly that Truefitt and Hill cream. I guess my opinion could not be too seriously taken since I haven't been doing this for long enough or experimented with many products but this was a blissful experience to me. This is my first shave ever with the Parker Variant, it arrived in the mail last night. set it to 2 for my first pass (48 hour stubble) and 1 for second and touch up.

Aftershave stung today more than expected. Oh well. Needed to do it because yesterday's Proraso shave ended up so patch and shitty-looking.\n\nI like this Body Shop goop from the local mall. It makes a decent lather without much effort and it has *a lot* of residual slickness for things like blade buffing and J-hooking. A tub doesn't last very long, though, and it costs almost as much as something like Stirling, so it's not the most cost-effective shaving product on the market. It scums up your sink and razor like Proraso does too. So. A little expensive and messy, but it works real well.\n\nHit 15 shaves on this Wilkinson blade. #14 was with my Edwin Jagger, #15 was with my Super Speed. It felt damned awful in the EJ and I didn't want to use it again. It felt much sharper and more efficient in the Super Speed today and I thought, \"Hmm, I could keep going with this.\" I think I'll switch to a fresh one next shave anyway to see the difference between a fresh blade and a 15-shave blade.",

My Friday shave is the full Barrister's Reserve Cool set I received earlier this week. I love the scent. Anything Italian Barbershop focused is right up my alley. The light menthol gave a bit of a chill when I took the dog out after my shave. This will be primarily a summer scent I think, but I have no problem working it into the rotation in this weather.\n\nI've also noticed subtle differences in how the various Reserve soaps load and lather. This one, for instance, seems more tacky than my Reserve Lavender or Fern. The consistency of glue paste for the early swirls of a face lather after the typical 25ish swirls loading from the tub. A bit more water opened the lather up to be closer to what I'm used to, and the shave was wonderful.\n\nI did use a bit of the CL unscented salve on my tougher dry spots by the bridge of my nose, but wanted this to be a mostly pure Reserve Cool shave. I really enjoyed it, and can't wait for the Waves and Fern EdC to drop in March. Happy Friday shaves all!",

      "body": "Friday 1/18 SOTD\n\n* Razor: ATT S1 Atlas\n* Blade: Bolzano (4)\n* Soap: Caties RWS Dirty Prose Luxury Cream\n* Brush: 26mm Paladin Sumo\n* Post: Duke Cannon Ice Cold Balm\n* Frag: Cartier Declaration EDT\n\n* Product Notes:\n\n* Soap: My prior complaints about CB - less than optimal protection and post shave -- seem to be greatly minimized with a two pass shave rather than my old three pass standard. Dirty Prose continues to smell magnificently - a vetiver floral - and my face felt fine today immediately after the shave. And two pass BBS of course, my 2019 resolution!\n\n* Brush: The Sumo has become my favorite brush. The ergonomics of the handle, efficient reliability of the knot, and brilliant jade color of the resin make this an aesthetic and technical pleasure to use. Plus it is not the priciest brush I own, plus the brand is pretty much readily available, though specific style and color combos may take a while to come up in the case of very exact shopping parameters.\n* Frag: one of the oddest of scents that was very successful - a sort of Indian food fougere that lacks most of the traditional elements of the fougere design, but yet recalls a woodsy scent pyramid all the same, with many odd spicy notes thrown in. A classic that has not lost its edge over the years!",

That's all good because I was acceptable from the awesome shave the day before. However, today's shave had more growth than normal. I did two passes and was going to leave it at that, but why? Today was even smoother than the last shave. To be honest, this is the first time I've noticed this much difference between the first and second shave on a blade. Hrm. So, to experiment I went with the third pass anyway. Upon closer inspection, I noticed slight irritation in one of my problem areas, and I believe it's user error. I KNOW I was a little overzealous and flew too close to the sun the shave before, but haven't closely monitored the *look* of the area, because there was no itchiness like there usually is when I shave too close. I didn't get any ingrown hairs that I can see, so I took precaution today and didn't go ATG in that area, which is something I can only do sometimes with certain razors. I'll see how things are tomorrow and proceed as necessary.\n\nOverall DFS, and I'm still just as stoked on this rig as before!\n\nHappy Friday, yo!!!",

First time using Stirling soap. Oh man... Wonderful.\n\nThe Tallow + Lanolin combination is beyond creamy. One of the best at protecting my skin and leaving a slick post shave. Despite the good soap, the razor and blade gave me a bit of irritation. I really need to stop using that razor... That said, no nicks and weepers again.\n\nMy skins feeling nice but I'll definitely put that razor down. Probably will be swapping it out with Merkur 34C or Parker 24C. Excited to use both!",

Mini-milestone today! 120 uses on this Nacet. And today was smoother than yesterday! Go figure.\n\nI feel like pausing for a bit. I think the Nacet can get to 150 with no problem. But I'm going to enjoy my milder razors for several shaves. But if you're addicted to hot marathon action, I've heard /u/youarebreakingthings is going to keep his Century+ streak going.\n\n## Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Gillette - Sheraton 1938 ::: Gillette - Nacet ‹120 uses›)*\n\nVery good shave today. No tugging or irritation. Very good results, too, even without the extra touch-up pass.\n\n## Soap Notes\n*^(Mystic Water Soaps - Brown Windsor)*\n\nAs always great performance and slickness on this one. Gave the razor excellent glide. Easy to dial in this lather now that I've uesd it for 10 days straight!\n\n1/4 tsp soap + 5 tsp water + poofy 22mm silvertip = just my kind of slick, but creamy lather. And got 2 extra passes, so could trim the ratio down if I wanted.\n\nScent was fairly monochromatic. Got maybe a tobacco/smoke note from the dry puck chunk. But when lathered, I didn't get that any more. What came out and stayed was something in the clove/allspice family, it seemed. Not really my cup of tea.\n\nScent strength was 3-4/10, very lightly present during shave.\n\n\n## Brush Notes\n*^(Whipped Dog - Silvertip 22mm Tall Handle)*\n\nwow, this knot impressed me today. I put an o-ring on it and that really helped to keep all the soft tips aiming more at my face. Felt so good.\n\nYou know, I think this brush mixed up a lather quicker, easier, and at a higher quality, than some other brushes I have with highly-dense knots. Which stands to reason. This knot has more flow-through, so it mixes more like a whisk, while super-dense knots mix more like a spoon. In this knot, it is easier for the soap to get between the bristles and be agitated than a knot where there is significantly less room between bristles.\n\n## Shave Quality\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Few hairs are showing some tip length (with most being cut flush)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm)\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

Despite all the praise around them, I was hesitant to purchase a vintage for use because I was worried about how it would have held up over the years. But, I went ahead and took the plunge; and I have to say, it was well worth it. I started out on setting 4 just for a more middle-of-the-road benchmark, and went with my favorite soap and blade so that as few variables as possible would be unfamiliar to me. It definitely feels different than my current daily driver (a Rockwell 6s generally on the 3 or 4 plate). It has a lot more auditory feedback which led me to notice any resistance or tugging more, I think. It freaked me out at first. However, after growing a bit more accustomed to it, It delivered just as close of a shave as my 6s has! After just one shave I'm already in love with it. It'll take another couple of shaves to see if it can beat the smoothness I get from the 6s. I feel like this is just the start of a journey down a very steep slope of razor purchases...",

Yesterday, while extremely bored at work, I stumbled across \"Marco's Method for Italian Soft Soaps\" over at Badger & Blade and thought I'd give it a shot with the Proraso. (I know most of the thread is singing the praises of Cella, but I don't have any trouble lathering that stuff.)\n\nOnly problem? I didn't need to shave my face today. No problem... I've got enough unsightly patches of chest hair that I can still come up with an excuse to break out a razor. I'll even use the ol' Mach 3 knock-off so I don't have to worry so much about nailing my razor angle on my torso.\n\nAnyway! Proraso lather!\n\nFollowing Marco's suggestions, I started with a fairly wet (just barely not dripping any more) firm-but-soft brush (horse) and loaded *very gently* off the soap, applying as little pressure as possible with about 120 swirls in 60 seconds. Then I moved to my shaving bowl and whipped it up for about a minute. It's pretty wet so it just starts as suds, but as the soap works in it starts to foam up properly, and by the end of the minute I had more slick, smooth, creamy lather than I ever imagined Proraso would be able to make, based on my prior experiences with it. It was beautiful, easy, and joyful.\n\nI guess I better give it another shot on my face next week and see how it performs. Maybe I don't have to give up on this soap after all.",

I've never smelled the cologne its inspired by. It's a manly scent,light to mid strong. Wife says it smells like lavender. Very slick so it may go on the to buy list.\n\n\n\n",

Also picked up a bath soap, which I've heard rave reviews about, as well as an aftershave balm. Any excuse to support the wonderful people behind their company is a-okay with me.\n\nPermasharp blade is still chugging along nicely, which is a great surprise to me. Should start keeping a ledger to remind myself how many shaves I've gotten it of it. Enjoy the start of the weekend!\n\n",

I exercised caution in my problem areas, but not too much, just no direct ATG, more of an angle, but not XTG either. WIN!!! I've done this with other razors as well with varying results. Im going to stick with this technique for this razor, and try it again on other razors.\n\nFirst go with Wholly Kaw since the initial run of Vetivert, which I really liked. This one is mildly scented, and I think I'm picking up a bit of the base with it. The lather was top notch, excellent slickness and post!!! I'm sure plenty of you have used this already.\n\nFantastic shave today and the sun is shining!!! Hasn't been the case for some time now!!!!\n\nHappy Saturday folks!!!\n\nEdit: thanks /u/falcons1583 for the Tempest set PIF!!!\n=)",

There is a lot of hype around it, and I agree that it is good. It really is a nice base, but if I had to do a blind test, I really doubt I could tell it apart from glissant (besides the smell).\n\nI honestly had one of the best shaves in a while. Now that I don't have any new blades to test, I'm left with the ones that I know work well for me, and it's really nice. It's just so comfortable knowing the blade/razor combination I'm about to use works well for my skin.\n\nIt's actually been a few weeks, at the very least since I last used a voskhod. Man these things are great! I keep getting away from using them, then I throw one in and I'm instantly reminded why I liked them.\n\nI think that's all I have to say about this shave. So a quick recap, barrister's reserve lavender is great, the 40s superspeed the tits, and voskhod blades are what life is all about.",

I like to think this is a unisex fragrance which I happen to enjoy, and I get positive comments from my wife.

Started snow blowing around 7:00 Looks like we didn't get as much as was predicted, but it was starting to turn to sleet/freezing rain when I was finishing up. Got in about 9:00, threw my snow gear in the dryer, and hopped in the shower.\n\nFelt like a scent that would warm me up. It did a great job. All around great shave.\n\nHave a nice Sunday, and hope everyone stays warm!",

When the package arrived I was pleasantly surprised, the samples are twice the size of most other vendors (1/2 oz vs 1/4), didn't even notice when I ordered. Soap is great and slick, soaps with tallow but without lanolin are my preference. Scent was nice and on the weaker side, which I prefer with scents in this family. Relieved, sometimes buying a few samples from the same vendor is a gamble. Sniffing the jars, looking forward to the other samples as well.",

I'll tell y'all. Since December I've kept a spreadsheet tracking every shave I do, including my setup, how well the shave went, anything new I tried, etc. I'm doing this to give every product I try a fair assessment and help me pin down exactly which factors in my routine/kit improve or decrease my chances of having a pleasant shave *without* letting a foggy memory or brand bias cloud my judgement.\n\nBut if you want to be scientific when you're tracking data from day to day, you have to change as few variables at a time as you can - otherwise, how do you know which change in your routine had the biggest impact on the results? So it gets repetitive.\n\nAnyway, today's setup is exactly the same as Friday's was, except that I replaced my 15-shave-old Wilkinson blade with a fresh one because I wanted to see how much sharper it felt.\n\nIt felt sharp. No problem cutting through whiskers, even ATG, so I figured, \"hell, let's do all three passes today.\" After three passes and a little touch-up, I'm BBS all over, but there's certainly more irritation at the skin-surface-level than the two passes with a dull blade were last week. I'll probably go back to two passes for the rest of the week and aim for DFS instead of BBS while I'm at work.",

That said, I was still able to get a nice comfortable shave with it. Technique trumps equipment, in the end.",

It is like lathering with a cloud. I got a lot of blueberry and black pepper from the soap. It definitely lathered up nice and thick, though (and maybe I under-hydrated) I felt like I was losing glide in favor of extra cushion. Soap definitely left my face feeling nice and nourished. Decided to pile on the nourishment with some CL DdT salve.\n\nToday's CL scent sample is Unconditional Surrender. Definitely getting the cigar tobacco and tonka bean. Just a slight hint of tea and floral.\n\nAs for yesterday's trial run with Sni Mato, I think it went well. It went on very dark and heavy on the chocolate. A few hours later, it was very sweet florals with a ribbon of dark chocolate running down the back. By the end of the day, my wife said I smelled \"like cake.\" For reference, she thinks Gratiot League Square smells \"like a bakery.\"",

We ended up getting around 5\" of snow here in the D. First real snowfall of the season, which is kind of odd. I did all my snowblowing/shoveling last night but woke up this morning to a huge pile at the end of my driveway because of the plow trucks. Don't ya hate that? Got that out of the way and headed off to have brunch with some friends. Food was excellent!\n\nI'm always happy to start the day with a nice shave so today I dusted off a soap I haven't used in a long time. It was ok. Slick but drying and not much in the way of residual slickness. Scent is ok. I just picked up this razor off the BST last week and have used it for the last few shaves. I prefer my pushbutton in the GEM arena so this will most likely get resold. I'm not in the habit of keeping razors that won't get used. Anyway, happy Sunday all! Make it count cause it's back to the grind tomorrow.\n",

I missed yesterday's shave cause I came down with some cold/flu thing.\n\n## Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Wolfman - WR1 Open Comb .61 Polished ::: Treet - Platinum ‹3 uses›)*\n\nWow! This razor and blade knocked down 2 days of growth like it was nothing. So smooth! And this blade has done that with a few other razors, too. So I guess it's just a good one.\n\nGreat comfortable shave with no irritation or tugging.\n\n## Soap Notes\n*^(Proraso - Red)*\n\nSo much hate on Proraso lately, and I discovered that I didn't have a video up yet on it. So I whipped out my Red, which I LOVE the sandalwood scent of, and it gave me the usually excellent lather, both slick and protective.\n\nI think, at TJ Maxx (or European) prices, it is a good buy. Some Ebay sellers right now have it for $7.50 and that seems okay. But if you don't shop around and pay $14 via some of the other ebay sellers, then you're better off getting some Stirling, IMO. Unless you just can't get enough of that sweet sandalwood of the Red, like me! :-)\n\n45 sec load + lightly wet long-bristled boar + 3 tsp water = about 4 passes of lather that was at just the right consistency for me. The reason I mentioned the long-bristles is that they didn't move much across the surface of the soap when i was loading. A more \"normal\" brush may need less load time because the tips would gather soap more efficiently.\n\nScent strength: 4-5/10. nicely present.\n\n\n## Brush Notes\n*^(Omega - 10098)*\n\nMost of the prickle disappeared from this brush with the last use, and that held true for today as well. I soaked it for an hour before use as a part of my experimental mild-break-in plan.\n\nWasn't a \"joy\" to use today, but was fine. Looking forward to watching it break-in more.\n\n## Shave Quality\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Smooth\n*Neck*: Smooth\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Cut flush to where I just see the tips (above average for me)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm)\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

Ended up with a very watery lather no matter how many times i twirled the brush. Good to know it doesn't work this way. 2/10 outcome, 10/10 experiment. Will not try again.",

Kind of felt like I was smearing chocolate on my face. I think they accomplished what they set out to do well though, so if that's your thing give it a shot. Really happy with the soap itself.\n\nSilver Blue was kind of meh after the Astra. Will give it another go tomorrow though.\n\nTaum Sauk is awesome.

Fucking smug prick. I was eating on the patio at this nice little restaurant downtown and he was sitting there eating some fucking salad. A salad. Typical Giants fan. He was there with his ugly Giants fan wife who, of course, was eating a salad too. Jesus Christ, I hate Giants fans so much.\n\nI could tell he thought he was a fan of the best team in baseball. 3 rings in 5 years, blah blah blah. He didn't say anything to me about it but the way that jerkoff was chewing, I mean Jesus. He even had a fucking Giants t-shirt on. I bet you he bought it at the team store like some kind of asshole. He and the fucking Giants fan cashier probably had this big, self-congratulatory exchange. \"Hi, I'd like to buy this best t-shirt in baseball with the best money in baseball, please\". I couldn't fucking believe this asshole. He just kept going at this fucking salad like he's King of the Goddamn World.\n\nI tried to ignore him but he just kept at it. Every time I looked away he'd conveniently grab for his water or some fucking passive aggressive bullshit so that it would draw my attention back to him. LOOK AT ME LOOK AT ME I SUPPORT THE BEST TEAM IN BASEBALL RIGHT HERE. Jesus.\n\nYou should have seen his wife too, what a bitch. The waitress came by to ask them how their food was and she relayed how fucking satisfied she was in the most irritating way possible. This fucking fake-politeness Giants fans put on is ridiculous. Like we all can't see through the veneer.\n\nNext thing I know, this guy pulls out his phone and starts texting. Are you fucking shitting me? I bet he just had to text his stupid friend all about how his fucking salad was almost as good as being in baseball heaven, which is filled with Giants fans.\n\nI couldn't fucking take it anymore. l told that fucking asshole what a smug piece of shit he was. He was like \"dude what are you talking about\" like he didn't fucking know what he was doing. l fucking tackled him right there. His wife starts screaming like a bitch. People are looking.\n\nStaff called the cops on me. Of fucking course they took his side. Cops did too and these prick Giants fans are actually gonna press charges for assault. I hate Giants fans so much.\n\n*(Heavily modified copypasta but it was fun.)*",

Was mild, but great cut!\n* The PDP63 was so that I could have a record of it in case new folks need a resource, since it is so highly recommended. Very good.\n* The Stirling Boar was because I'm just on a Boar kick these days and this little guy was on sale and the handle seems really ergo. I was very impressed.\n\n## Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Fatip Testina Gentile ::: Gillette - Silver Blue ‹20 uses›)*\n\nLove this razor! so smooth while giving me an excellent, close cut. Really nice closeness, even in my trouble spot. Performs really well, for me at least, with the GSB blade.\n\nNo tugging. Only a little irritation when I went a little ATG on my trouble spot. But disappeared quickly.\n\n## Soap Notes\n*^(Pre de Provence - No. 63)*\n\n45 sec load + pre-soaked puck (about 8 mins) + high-backbone boar + 3.6 tsp water = just right. Just the right amount of sweet creamy slickness. Razor just glided effortlessly. I forgot how great this soap is.\n\nScent Strength: 5/10. Nicely available during the shave. Love the scent, too.\n\nWill continue to recommend this one to noobs and vets alike!\n\n\n## Brush Notes\n*^(Stirling - Boar 24mm Factory Seconds)*\n\nFirst time with this guy. Bought one that had a problem with the logo and saved some bucks. I expect this will be a keeper. Maybe my strongest backbone boar, but obviously that will lessen as it splays and gets softer.\n\nI soaked it for 1.5 hours prior to shave, and it performed really well. Not prickly, but scrubby, I'd say.\n\nIt looks small in photos, but it's stocky. 24mm knot has plenty of hairs! And though the handle is short, its shape made it pretty easy to grasp, even when soapy. My big mitts did want something a little bigger, but I was surprised at how well it worked. Heavier than it looks, too. Achieves above its pay grade? Yep. Very favorable first impression.\n\n## Shave Quality\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Smooth\n*Neck*: Smooth\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Cut flush to where I just see the tips (above average for me)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm)\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

Bandwagon smells so gud, I love this scent. I scored this set for $25 including the liniment and this was my first use. I haven't used bison in quite awhile, because I've been obsessed with icarus blooming, but damn this is such a solid base. I still prefer icarus (which wasn't the case until very recently once I learned how to use it) but that doesn't take anything away from how incredible this base is. They can definitely co exist. This is far denser, dials in so fast, slick, with a great post shave. You'd be hard pressed to find a more well rounded easy to use base. Also, this brush has broken in very very nicely. My first couple uses weren't too exceptional but I think that was either due to it not being broken in or it needed to rehydrate after I cleaned the ever living shit out of it. It's so soft, not gelly, but soft and splays so easy. I think I might prefer the gelly tips and slightly more backbone of the B6 but this is super luxurious. Great end to my Monday. Hope everyone has a great Tuesday and hopefully this week fly's by.",

I basically bought this set just based on the artwork on it's own (Will really does an excellent job on his packaging), but the scent description's rubber note intrigued me as well. When I first smelled Promises, the rubber note dominated everything and I put it away for pretty much all of last winter. This year however, the citrus and honey, and especially the whiskey stand out. I've never been on a snow mobile ride but if this is what it smells like, count me in.",

I've been morning shaving pretty often lately and worried the jasmine in it might offend others so it's been awhile since I used it. It's just a wonderful blend of smells and is such a wonderful shave experience that I don't get just smelling the tub. The aftershave really cements it and has me wondering if I might want to pick up the EDP that's about to come out. Made it through the negative and single digit temperatures, ready for today to hopefully melt some of that snow and ice off of things. Have a great Tuesday everyone!",

(Thought I might have grown out of it - apparently not). Putting on that alcohol-based aftershave was like a dude whuppin' on my face with a crowbar for five minutes, so now I know: leave the nice-smelling Gillette goop alone for anything except flawlessly executed shave days.\n\nDid a modified 2-pass today. Started with a pass about half way between WTG/XTG, then finished with a pass about half way between XTG/ATG. More efficient than a basic WTG > XTG shave but quicker and less irritating than a full 3-pass. BBS results across most of the face, DFS on the neck with only a little irritation. Technique still needs some work I guess.\n\nThoughts on fresh blade vs dozen-plus-shaves blade: yup, it's sharper. Mows down whiskers better with noticeably less tugging. Also, noticeably harsher on the skin surface. More burn unrelated to whisker irritation. I think that if I'm just aiming for DFS instead of BBS, I almost like the blade better when it's less sharp.",

The sharp blade in the small gap head helps make it so, and I find this combo better than anything I've tried in my Timeless 0.68 SS SB.\n\n* Soap: Eufros gets the menthol exactly right here - more impact than the low dose seen in B&M Adagio & First Snow, but yet far more room given to the scent than in face freezers like Stirling's examples. As a result, you get menthol feel along with a pleasant and complex lime scent. Perhaps my favorite mentholated soap...\n\n* Frag: As fine a cold weather scent as it was a Spring scent... And it is indeed well suited to its title!",

So thanks to /u/Hyvasuomi79 for organizing the PIF and sending the Noble Otter soap and aftershave. And thanks to /u/Cadinsor for the excellent, wonderful, fabulous razor. First off, this razor is badass. It is beautiful, perfectly weighted, sleek and is one of the better shaves I've had since starting the wet shaving journey. This is really good stuff. Thanks!\n\nAnd the soap/aftershave. I have tried a sample of The Noir et Vanille but, as is often the case, the full tub outperforms the sample. I am a lover of all things Noble Otter, so I was happy to receive this. I have to tell you, the scent is more complicated than I thought when I was using the sample. I definitely get the vanilla and a hint of the tea, but the surprise was a great citrus scent, particularly on the dry down from the aftershave. The soap performs like I would expect from NO and the aftershave was excellent and very complimentary. A definite win all the way around.",

Absolutely loving this razor! Both plates offer a fantastic shave.\n\nThis soap is great! It's almost identical to Pre de Provence is all aspects aside from scent. Hard puck, this one doesn't come in a tin, but it's I think 10 bucks for a 100g puck, can't beat that price with a stick! The scent has a light refreshing herbaceous vibe. It may be a little chilly out (I know I know, it's relative though), but the sun is shining!!!\n\nHave a great day err'one!!!",

I was able to get a really consistent lather throughout all three passes instead of them getting progressively wetter/thinner. I'm not sure why more people don't use these nicer bowls with the grooves to help build the lather, but maybe that will become more apparent as I use it.\n\nStill love that Mood Indigo scent.\n\nFirst day back from a couple day, work-sponsored vacation.

It is it's own scent, but if CB Royal Garden and B&M Jacinthe had a soap shortie, this would be it. The scent is very nice, but the star here was the performance. It's slickness and post-shave feel rival any of the top tier soap bases out there such as Reserve, Excelsior, and Icarus. Its a true soap base masterpiece.\n\nI'm really looking forward to trying some more of Ben's scent creations in this amazing soap base. Well done /u/mammothben and yet another thanks to /u/Hyvasuomi79 for all the hard work he devoted to the PIF. Thanks guys.",

I loaded a bit more soap than usual and was rewarded with a really great lather. Texaus gets a reputation for having a light scent but it opened up a bit more once lathered.\n\nThe razor/blade combo is going strong. I don't think I'll have any issues getting the Polsilver to 25 shaves but we'll see how it feels over the next few shaves.\n\nAnother soap sample bit the dust. I'm nowhere near making a dent to any of my soap tubs but it's satisfying to use up an entire sample.",

Possible review coming once it's broken in. Next up on the blade chopping block are blades from BIC. They felt harsh at first but got smoother as the shave went on. My first time with Grecian Horse was interesting. I picked it up because my guy Kai Triska loves this soap. The soap is pleasant but I really wish the scent was stronger. Performance was only okay, but I think I need to spend more time with it to figure out the A&E base.\n\nHump dayyyyyyyyyy!",

Tried the fabled Finest Badger from Stirling, and stuck a Feather in a Mild head on my Chris Bradley.\n\n## Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Karve - Christopher Bradley A Plate ::: Feather ‹7 uses›)*\n\nSuch a smooth and close shave! No irritation or tugging. Almost felt like the blade was slicing through butter, even on the first pass. Such a delight.\n\nAnd shaving with a slightly against-the-grain aspect on my trouble spot went off without a hitch with this blade, unlike many others.\n\n## Soap Notes\n*^(Stirling - Blu)*\n\n30 sec load, lightly-wet badger + 3tsp water + a 1 hr presoak of brush (since this was first time I used it) = just enough lather to do the job, and it was super slick and protective, with a great luxury feel during the rinses.\n\nScent Strength: 5/10. Enjoyable during shave.\n\nScent: very close version of Aqua Velva but this maybe had a little more focus on the florals involved, and a little less masculine.\n\n\n## Brush Notes\n*^(Stirling - Finest Badger 26mm Factory Seconds)*\n\nThis is an amazing little brush! But it's not little! It's only little in price. Tips super soft. My 1 hr soak before the shave turned the higher-backbone bristles into something much nicer. I don't expect to do that for every shave. I'll likely treat it like any other badger next time and see how it goes. I don't like this standard black handle -- I found it very tedious to grip when wet -- but that can easily be remedied. Will continue to highly recommend this brush.\n\n## Shave Quality\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Smooth\n*Neck*: Smooth\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Cut flush to where I just see the tips (above average for me)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm)\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

Couple that with a 45+ minute commute on snowy roads with my front wheel drive Mazda 3 hatchback and I could use a little Jameson in my coffee this morning.\n\nOriginally, I planned to make this a Barrister and Mann Nocturne shave, but the cold, dry air has been causing havoc for my skin and I couldn't reintroduce a cinnamon soap with how bad it's been over the past few weeks. Decided to go with Barrister's Reserve Lavender. Rushed the lather and my technique was poor, and I actually ended up nicking myself once for the first time in a long time. On to better shaves tomorrow. Happy Wednesday, all.",

I'm not sure what drew me to this razor. I've owned a 23C and sold it sometime ago. These types of \"beginnerish\" razors get compared often. Must be hearing Paul H Films go on about how the chrome is the same used in Rolls-Royces? Is that even true? Shave three of three was just okay on this Platinum Lux. Quite a few nicks and some irritaiton. May need to do some blade exploration with this razor. It's funny how your opinion on a scent can change. In another SOTD post more than a year ago I waxed on about how much I liked Floid Vigoroso. Maybe bottle worthy at a later date I though? In my mind the amber was the same scent as vigoroso sans menthol. While the powdery floral barbershop amber was nice it didn't wow me. Again more testing is needed... Cella needed no testing! Perfromance was great and I like the scent quite a bit. Normally, an almond, cherry scent doesn't sound like my kind of thing but Cella keeps it light and fresh without going into cherry cough syrup territory. Already Wednesday ya'll. Keep at it!\n",

Issay Miyake Eau d' Issay is the closest I can think of, but the yuzu is far too bright for this, and works best in summer.\n\nI think next time I'll try a single spray of Issay, and a couple of sprays of Encre Noir after to add more woodiness. Yeah, I'll do that!!!\n\nHappy shaving!!!",

As far as scent, the mental image it conjures is sitting on the back porch of a house adjacent to the woods on a fall morning, drinking a chai tea. Serenity indeed. Yesterday I used 4th & Pine splash and it reminded me a bit of CFG Santa Paula, so I broke out my sample today to compare. They both have a resiny/woody base but I get more of a citrus note from SP and 4th & Pine has a slight sweetness to it that I can't place. Not as similar as I initially thought, but both among my favorite wetshaving scents.",

As soon as I opened it and sniffed, I laughed. My wife calls this type of scent \"boy\" (as opposed to sandalwood-y, or leather-y, which are \"man\", we're sophisticated!), I call it \"clean blue\". It's very familiar and similar to lots of shampoos, body washes, etc you find at the supermarket. You know this smell, even if you don't realize it. Yet somehow, this is better, although I can't really say how or why, although i'm sure it has to do with real ingredients versus chemicals. I've long been surprised that nobody made a real shaving soap similar to this, although I guess something like Catie's Bubbles Le Marche du Rasage is the same vibe. Definitely a full set purchase for me.\n\n​\n\nAlso first time use of the SynBad. I think I like the SilkSmoke better, but definitely need to use it more.",

I know the scent is polarizing, but I actually like it. The performance is excellent. This is a soap that is definitely on the rebuy list if I ever manage to kil this puck.\n\nI know I am in a minority, but I really love boar brushes. I can't explain why either. I mean, I have a number of badgers and some of them, particularly the Declaration knots, are stellar. But there is just something about a good boar that just calls to me. For one thing, the lather release of a boar is something I find very appealing. /u/Cadinsor and I had this conversation at the Maggard Meet. There is no argument I can make as to why someone should prefer a boar brush. You either do or you don't. I don't consider myself contrarian, but I do seem to march to my own tune.\n\nThursday calls.",

Mint is always a favorite scent of mine no matter the weather. The duke cannon aftershave is a Target pick up around 8$ I think. The menthol in the aftershave was a great match with the mint and honestly reminded me of the menthol in Scale Polish.

Areas of fog. High near 49. Breezy, with a south wind 15 to 20 mph, with gusts as high as 45 mph. Chance of precipitation is 100%. New precipitation amounts between a half and three quarters of an inch possible. High tide at 1:27 this afternoon.\n\nI think we will see a decent amount of Sellout for shaves today. As I was going through my collection I realized that this is the only \"dupe\" scent that I have. This is from when /u/Fahrenheit915 was trying out bases, before he got into the rabbit hole of making soap. It's a great performer. I don't know how much his current bast differs from this base but still fantastic.\n\nWas a very nice shave. Lather was great. Scent is a little light, but I can't really fault anyone for that. I am counting this as on-theme as it's a dupe of A&F Fierce and the base is killer.\n\nHave a nice Thursday everyone!",

Two rather similar scents, by strange coincidence, and I love them both unironically despite their reputations. Anyway, those two became cemented in my scent-memory as the way A Man smelled, so when I discovered that Stirling sells a DN dupe I had to have it. I gotta say: it's pretty much spot on. It's also subtle enough after rinsing off that even my scent-sitive wife can handle it.\n\n**Base thoughts:** I gave up on canned goop after high school and spent about a decade and a half wet-shaving with cream from a tube before my coworker introduced me to the dizzying world of artisan-crafted soaps. Stirling is my first crack at something that didn't come out of a factory somewhere and it does not disappoint. Lathers up ril gud with the ol' horse brush. Nice residual slickness for buffing / hooking / etc - way better than the glycerin based soaps I've tried, so I guess I'm a fan of tallow (which is also found in the Cella that I love so much).\n\n**Technique thoughts:** Worked on my modified 2-pass a little more today with the 45°/135° passes rather than 0°/90°/180° passes demonstrated in most shaving videos. Both passes had the razor turned at a bit of an angle for the tricky spots to get a little bit of a slant/Gillette-slide thing going on. God damn did it ever work well. BBS everywhere except the tender zone on my neck, which landed neatly at DFS instead. No irritation or redness anywhere and only a wee bit o blood when I made a mistake in The Mustache Zone, and it was dried over before I had a chance to rinse it off. Very pleased with how things went.",

I find a solid dose of cold sets my face up well for the rest of the day, and more or less relieves me from having to use moisturizers to supplement. Most of my preferred post shaves use menthol at this point - more or less kills the scent beyond the most basic notes, but given the longevity of balm scents anyway (14 minutes? Less?) I don't feel that I am missing out on much.\n\nFrag: Early AM meeting today with The Power. ADP is a great scent for such purposes - conservative though interesting, and pretty minimal projection.",

We bought an EV charger on Amazon but never got around to installing it. Well, I tried to install it and just couldn't get it to work. My wife tried to install it and just couldn't get it to work. Finally, we decided we needed to verify that the wires were hot and it turned out that they did not appear to have power. Thus, the builder is sending an electrician out today to look at the wiring and I'm working from home so someone can be here when it happens.\n\nSo, I got up this morning, took a 6:30 conference call with some folks in London and Luxembourg, then had a shower and an overdue head shave. Yes, I bloomed my Icarus soap. Yes, it performed wonderfully. No, the Simpsons brush isn't nearly as impressive now as it was when I bought it due mostly to the fact that I've added several Declaration brushes to my den since that day. Yes, it's still a very nice brush.\n\nSince the wife is out of town and I'm not going in to the office, I figured today would be a good day to give Lamplight Penance a test drive. First, let me say that u/hawns does not mess around with the EdP samples. I was expecting them to come in the same 5mL plastic spray bottles that the EdT samples come in and that would have been fine by me. Nope... EdP samples come in nice glass spray bottles and are boxed up in the same box that the genuine article comes in. Seriously classy presentation. I spritzed myself less than 30 minutes ago and my first thought was \"I don't see what everyone's making such a big deal about...it's a little sweet and a bit sharp, but not like an actual kerosene lamp.\" Within 3 minutes, I was eating my words. I smell like a kerosene lamp. I will likely smell like a kerosene lamp through my 9:00 conference call and I could still smell like a kerosene lamp when the electrician arrives at 10. We will see.",

I'll admit my title is a bit tongue in cheek, but as a wet shaver going into day **34** of a partial government shutdown I'm having to get creative with my daily shaves.\n\nLike most of us, I had a fairly large amount of samples that have been taking up room in my medicine cabinet that were half used so I'm getting creative. Mixing and matching samples, using shave bazaar to trade a few full pucks of soap I can't stand the smell of ect.\n\n* **Razor:** Merkur **34c**\n* **Blade:** Astra Superior Platinum\n* **Soap:** Chiseled Face \"Midnight Stag\"\n* **Brush:** Maggard 24mm synthetic\n* **Aftershave:** Pinault \"Clubman\"\n* **Thoughts:** Not a combo I would have thought to try in normal circumstances but surprisingly I think it works. The mix makes me think of a getting a shave at Barbershop in the 1940's-1950's that is full of greasers with leather jackets and motor oil. I kinda like it!",

I usually just use whatever I want. I did, however, a few days ago, uncover my jar of CdA, and noticed the large ring of death. So, I got a spoon and made a mound in the middle. For whatever reason I looked at today's theme, and thought immediately of MLS CdA. We don't see the name as much here, but I still love the stuff!!!\n\nThis brush is awesome. It's a one off, but it's also the first B5 to be released. It was an experimental brush, so the loft is lower than standard, just how I like my brushes!!! SO glad I was able to get this one!!!\n\nAnother fantastic shave! BBS/DFS and it's sunny again!!! Perfect day for some Colonia vibes!!!\n\nHave a good one folks!!!\n",

I'm not sure if there is an essential oil used in the soap but I also experienced the same burning sensation with the aftershave. Oddly enough the lightly Aventus scented post shave serum does not cause this reaction. I'll likely post it to the bazaar.",

Weekend in Malibu is just delicious. And since I'm traveling away from Malibu, I thought it appropriate to bring it and remind me of the sunny, 75 degree weather in January. Performance, as usual for Stirling is great, not quite Top Tier, but definitely punching way above its price bracket.\n\nWhenever I travel, I bring this Stirling Synthetic, and it's fine. Now that I have a badger brush at home though, it just doesn't match up. I just greatly prefer the natural hair feel of the badger. Oh well.\n\nHappy Shaves Y'all!",

Even though I picked up the pace, I managed to get a clean shave without any nicks or cuts.\n\nMerkur 34C is an amazing razor. Picked it up yesterday and shaved with it no problem. No irritation, smooth, and a joy to work with. The Shark SS blades were a bit off for me. Not the best but not the worst. It performs at a middle of the road, maybe a tad lower. But a decent combo with the 34C.\n\nThe Vie Long Horse hair brush is really breaking in nicely. Although people say horse hair does not break in, I can feel it getting softer. Unlike boar hair where it splits, horse hair just gets softer with continual use. It definitely will take a longer time but to compensate for that, I use it almost everyday even if I don't shave. It still has the scritch but not as worse as how it first started.\n\nThe soap is an interesting one. I picked it up having a mojito scent in mind but it was very basil-strong scent. I've gotten used to it but at first, I was turned off. It lathers great and the scent becomes more minty and clean soapy towards the end. It does have bentonite clay which my skin irritates to but I believe it's only a small amount. It irritated my skin the other day but today was fine for some reason.\n\nPost shave is the usual Witch Hazel combo for me. Thayer's + Nivea = irritation free and moisturized skin. This was not a BBS shave but close enough for me. Overall, a great shave.",

I enjoyed the scent and am now thinking that maybe I should have picked up a set. Got no irritation, which was great because I have from other spiced apple scents. Guess this is more apples and smoke.\n\nMy barber makes his own AS. Love the winter blend. Lots of pine and other woodsy scents, plus black pepper and basil if I remember right. The ingredients list says vodka and witch hazel are the top two ingredients, which is interesting.",

The day started with a bit of drama as my wife woke me up at about 8 this morning frantic because she had just gotten off the phone with my FIL who said that my MIL was having an allergic reaction and her throat was closing up and the Epi-Pen didn't work because the needle was bent somehow. My wife told him to take her to the ER and that she was on her way. Did you get all that? She woke me up to tell me this and that she was leaving our daughter home, to which I said of course. After a while I found a babysitter (my sister) because I had to go to work and the situation was handled. In the end, my MIL is ok. She was treated, they think it's a reaction to a medication she's on, and released. It was scary but it came to a good end.",

It just seemed greater than the sum of its parts. Castle Forbes makes an excellent cream. The Zenith brush is well broken in. The 200 year old Greaves cuts good. The Fine AS smells good. The CF balm is soothing. I can say these things about most of the stuff I have. But there are times when a shave is just more enjoyable than it appears on paper. Today was an example.\n\nYeah.

This is a major improvement in my opinion from the current base. The soap lathered easily and produced a thick, dense and fatty lather. The slickness was improved from the current base, but especially the residual slickness and fatty feeling was better. I really can't think of any criticisms of it, except that maybe the slickness isn't quite up with the big boys. But that's very minor. We live in exciting times to have so many good options.",

I don't remember it ever lighting my face on fire like that before but damn. It wasn't quite as bad during the shave but the splash was like gasoline. Smells incredible though so it's worth the 60 second of pain and 15 minutes of blotchy redness. Friday, we did it. Fuck yeah let's power through this bitch and finally get some sleep for the next two days. I hate work and I hate that I'm such a slut for money.",

Not gonna lie, that is by far the worst that I've ever had aftershave burn my face! If I had to point a finger at any one thing, I think that I'll take the blame and admit that I didn't pay attention to angle and just mindlessly shaved like I would with an injector. Well, tomorrow is a new day and another try. I'll do better about paying attention to it. Today's gonna be a bit of a long day, but it's 12 hours of pure OT and it's Friday and I'm off the weekend, so I can't really complain. Happy Friday!",

I'm 15 shaves in and it seems like it will easily last another 10 if not more. I may replace the Guard cart soon. It's not tugging yet but it feels like it's beginning to dull. I really wasn't expecting it to outlast the Polsilver.",

Though the first pass of lather was too wet, and I had to rescue it. Trying out Haslinger Sheep's Milk 2017 version. Tomorrow will be the older version which should have Tallow (or more of it). Doing a little comparison. And also shaving with my Futur for the last couple of times before I put it up on the Bazaar.\n\n## Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Merkur - Futur Setting 3 ::: Wilkinson Sword - India ‹4 uses›)*\n\nWas a rough first pass because I over-hydrated the lather. But after that, there was no tugging or irritation. This razor has worked really well with any blade I've put in it. The more I use it the more I don't want to get rid of it. It's smooth, but efficient too, at least at the settings where I'm camping out near.\n\n## Soap Notes\n*^(Haslinger - Sheep's Milk)*\n\nLather didn't start great, but ended well. Went back to the puck and got more soap and made pass 2 and 3 really slick and creamy. I just over-watered it. Finished up as an excellent lather, both slick, protective, and creamy.\n\nUnsoaked puck: I lathered for maybe a minute or 1:15 and I think that amount would have worked if I hadn't gone too far with the water.\n\nScent: This soap is very lightly scented and is linen-ish. A lighter version of the similar Mitchell's Wool Fat, IMO.\n\nScent Strength: 2-3/10. Very light, which is fine, because strong is just not what this soap is trying to be.\n\n\n## Brush Notes\n*^(Semogue - 1800 Boar)*\n\nFirst time using it and it did well. Soaked it the previous night for a few hours but didn't use it because of tricky schedule. Then soaked it again tonight and used it. Right now, not prickly, but a little scrubby, and backbone is medium.\n\n## Shave Quality\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Cut flush to where I just see the tips (above average for me)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm)\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

Time to move on to the next one! Love Stirling's bath soaps so much. I think I have two full bars and a sample or two to get through yet, but eventually I'll have to restock with some seasonally appropriate scents for spring and summer.\n\nAs for today's shave... it was -2 degrees when I woke up this morning with wind chills of about -18. I am working from home this AM, and my wife is gone working a shift at the hospital until about 8 PM tonight. I needed a scent that fit the cold weather, and that I wouldn't wear normally. I toyed with the idea of pairing some sort of shave (Reserve Spice + unscented salve?) with Lamplight Penance, but decided it was the right day to take one more step toward finishing off my sample of Leviathan. When I first used this scent, I just didn't get it. Everyone raved about it, but I found it pungent and kind of sour. Over the course of time, I moved my way toward being on the fence about it. After using it today, gosh darn it, it's finally clicked. I like it. I don't know what took me so long but the three main notes in it finally make sense together, and I even get a little cocoa of something similar on the dry down. Does this mean I'll be hunting for a full tub, splash, and EdT? That remains to be seen, but I'm surprised at how much my enjoyment of this scent has changed over time. Almost a complete 180.\n\nAs for the shave itself, I loaded the heck out of the sample from a tin in hopes of killing it today, but it looks like I'll get one more shave out of it. I did learn that I may be under loading the Glissant base. My lather had huge volume and slickness that I sometimes undershoot when using the Seville, 42, or Nocturne. Something for me to keep an eye on.\n\nFor those of you in the midwest, stay warm this weekend! Happy Friday shaves!",

Better than nothing! Off the puck yesterday my wife thought it was stanky. Lathered though, her thoughts were \"The scent is like good stuff, plus a bit of lawnmower.\"\n\nPersonally, I enjoyed it a lot. Barrister and Mann do a great job with their stanky scents. Plus, I figure the splash and EdT add to the overall scent while not being identical and rounding it out, like other BAM products. Gotta keep my eye out for a full set, but I feel like I'm going to have to get pretty damn lucky. Last time I saw one on the bazaar I messaged 10 minutes after the post and still missed it.\n\nI may have picked the wrong day to bust out Hallows because it is beautiful and cold outside. Screw it, I love the scent.",

I can see why it's a popular choice--soft on the face, builds lather quickly and holds a lot of it--but still somehow less satisfying than using my boar brushes. I guess I crave that exfoliating feeling. CFG splashes work great w/ my skin--perfect balance in terms of moisturizing without any residual \"tackiness\" feeling. Grabbed this bottle of Easy St via BST and it has become my go-to when I don't have the matching splash for a soap. Nice clean scent (yuzu & green tea) which doesn't linger heavily.",

It's a little smoother, at the cost of the same amount of efficiency. I'm still able to get BBS, but with a little more work ie minor blade buffing and touch ups, something that pretty much needs to be done regardless of razor, but just a little more than with the AGGR plate. The AGGR plate does have more blade feel, but not much, and just a little quicker to the desired result. So, mild plate for daily driver and or when you want to have complete disregard and just go for it, AGGR plate when you need the closest shave possible.\n\nI've seen some ask what Nuavia Blu smells like, I liken it to a hybrid of Floid Blu and Barrister's Reserve Cool. It shares some attributes of both haha.\n\nAwesome shave today, BBS where I want it and just a little more where I don't, just how I like it! BOOM!!!\n\nHappy Friday folks!!!",

I think it was too much of a rush job on my part. Didn't soften up the scruff enough, didn't get the lather right, blade probably needed to be changed. Just irritation everywhere. I should stick with just shaving after a shower.\n\nHallward's Dream is great though. A very pleasing barbershop scent, and when I got the lather right, it was very comfortable.\n",

I've got a full Arko stick pressed into a ceramic bowl, so I wanted to see how little soap is required to produce enough lather for todays task. With only 4-5 light swirls using my synthetic brush, I was able to palm lather just the right amount for an XTG, ATG, and pick up pass! Very quick and economical!",

I like that aspect of it but I don't know if it's a daily driver. The benzoin smoke note is REALLY evocative but at work I feel more comfortable smelling more like a dryer sheet.",

Dug the Teacher's Pet, but I don't think i'd reach for it that often. It's the first soap i've thought of perpetually keeping a sample size around for for when the itch needs scratching. Soap itself is top notch, though. I need another pass through the order, but as of now Picture Break and maybe History 101 will be purchases.\n\nLittle irritation on the jaw. I've mostly been using 40s Superspeed and Injector L! lately, both which have a 64mm gap. Slim @ 3 is 66mm. Could that extra 2mm have done it? Who knows. Probably something I did stupid and am not remembering, though. It was 10 minutes ago, after all. Going to dial it back to 2 tomorrow which is 61mm, which is what the GEM G-Bar is which also usually works well for me.",

Lather was wonderful. Brush a little burn-ey since it is new, though. And probably my last shave with the Futur.\n\n#### Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Merkur - Futur Setting 3 ::: Wilkinson Sword - India ‹5 uses›)*\n\nDid great, just like yesterday. A little blade feel, but a nice close cut. No tugging, or irritation from the blade. A good razor, and this cheap blade works well in it (at least for those of my skin and hair type).\n\n#### Soap Notes\n*^(Haslinger - Sheeps Milk - Schafmilch Older Tallow)*\n\nThis is some creamy, luxuriously lathering stuff! A definite improvement over the current version (though current version is still nice).\n\nSuper slick and nice cushion. Scent is a nice clean, low-key linen type, similar to Mitchell's Wool Fat.\n\nI loaded for too long (because yesterday's needed that), but this stuff loaded up much quicker. I ended up with way too much. For one thing, it had been grated and put into a container. That helps make load time more efficient sometimes. I could probably have gotten away with a normal 30 sec load.\n\n\n#### Brush Notes\n*^(Zenith - B10 Boar Red)*\n\nI think I got a littl brush burn from this one. Just my second time using it, so I'm not really surprised. Though I like that this is a larger knot, my Semogues were much softer at this point.\n\n#### Shave Quality\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Few hairs are showing some tip length (with most being cut flush)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm)\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

The combo of this efficient pairing with the Reserve base usually gives me roughly a 12 hr BBS and all from 15 mins of shaving. It's a tad harder for me to get that effect with any DE / blade, so I begrudgingly concede that all the AC fans may have something here.\n* The General is a brilliant shaver also, and dirt cheap for its 316L and quality machining. What happened to the brand? In Fall of last year, the owner wandered off into the shop to make a new DE (probably not the best idea) and then was never heard from again.\n* Brush: Great synth, very splayable, yet firm when not compressed. Great value, reliable efficiency. Just wish I knew why it was called \"Mew Brown\".\n* Post: CL scented salves. Sigh. Sic transit gloria mundi.\n* Frag: Lovely rose chypre from Lauder, the perennial dark horse of male perfumery.",

      "body": "**2019-01-26 SOTD: Stirling Sample #4/10**\n\n**Razor:** 1955 Ball End Tech, nickel finish\n\n**Blade:** Wilkinson Sword, German (shave #4)\n\n**Brush:** Vie Long 21mm Horse (VL-14080)\n\n**Prep:** Took a shower\n\n**Lather:** [Stirling Piacenza](https://trythatsoap.com/collection/113/) ([Parma-inspired](http://www.basenotes.net/ID26120042.html))\n\n**Post:** Nivea Sensitive goop\n\nJudging from the length of my ramblings below, it must be a Saturday... no rush to get out the door to the office today!\n\n**Razor thoughts:**\n\nI saw a photo of a spiral-handled Tech a while ago and thought it looked really pretty. I asked /u/fuckchalzone if he had any in his collection and he graciously found me a British aluminum-handled spiral Tech from 1974 with a beat-up Zamak head. He also sent me an older 1955 brass-headed Tech that I could cannibalize for parts to make the 1974 useable. Once they arrived I decided that I liked the 1955 better in every way from a functional perspective, so the cute 1974 became a showpiece on my shaving shelf and the practical 1955 went into my rotation of shavers.\n\nMuch like my Super Speed, I find this 1955 Gillette Tech milder than my Edwin Jagger: there's less \"blade feel\" on my face and the corners of the razor head aren't nearly as pointy (which is my biggest complaint about the EJ head). I'm tempted to say that the Tech might be slightly more aggressive and efficient than my Super Speed, but it's a pretty close call. One definite advantage it has is that the thinner head makes it nice and easy to get into tight corners such as under the nose. I think it might be a little easier to find the right angle with it, too.\n\nMy shave was just as close as it ever is (BBS over much of the face and nearly there on the neck), so I would say that although this razor is mild, it's still pretty efficient... or at least, it's pretty efficient for someone like me with sparse facial hair.\n\n**Scent thoughts:**\n\nWorking through a load of Stirling samples right now - I ordered pretty much every sample that I could get from Top of the Chain's selection of 15 options except for the ones that sounded entirely unappealing to me. Obviously the performance of their soap is well known so I see no reason to expound upon its virtues. Instead I will just discuss how I feel about the fragrance. So far I have tried Executive Man (pretty neat and I'll write about it more next week), Ozark Mountain (smells more to me like a scented candle than a forest), Stirling Noir (excellent), and now Piacenza today. Still to come will be Arkadia, Baker St, Barbershop, Dunshire, Sandpiper, and Sharp Dressed Man.\n\nUntil I tried this soap, I didn't know what \"Amber\" meant as a scent, but now I have a pretty clear idea and [a quick Google search explained a lot.](https://soulniche.com/pages/amber-resin) It reminds me of the incense my dad burned when I was a kid (to hide his weed stank) and it smells pretty much exactly like the [Spencer's Gifts](https://www.spencersonline.com/category/home-dorm/incense-burners/pc/272/1688.uts) store at the mall (where they have an incense section beside the display case of bongs).\n\nTryThatSoap lists Piacenza's aromas as Amber, Musk, Orange, Lemon, Lavender, and Rosemary. The combined mixture of these components (for me) is a soap that smells very much like incense and oranges, and once you've rinsed off your face and the citrus scents fade there's a hint of soapy floral musk hiding among the incense. Having grown up with incense all through my childhood, I like it. Having avoided incense all her life, my wife doesn't like it.\n\n**I'm curious regarding the apparent similarity between Piacenza and B&M Seville - I imagine they probably smell similar to some degree with their citrus, rosemary, and lavender components, but how different is the drydown (Piacenza's musk and amber vs Seville's patchouli and oakmoss)? Do you folks think one fragrance is distinctly more appealing than the other (or are they just two sides of the same coin)?**",

I previously mentioned in a SOTD that I've been impacted as a federal employee during the shutdown. It looks like some relief is on the horizon. That aside, it's given me a greater apperception this hobby, our community and forced me to take a hard look at how much I buy and deciding how much is enough. Wet Shaving as become a luxury to me. The ritual of the shave, warming the water, soaking a brush and building a lather has become a form of stress relief. I don't think I'll be taking our hobby for granted from now on.\n\n* **Razor:** Maggard MR3 with a V3 head\n* **Blade:** Astra Superior Platinum\n* **Soap:** Black Ship Grooming \"Philips Fougere\"\n* **Brush:** Maggard 24mm synthetic\n* **Aftershave:** Pinaud Clubman\n\n**Thoughts:** This may be my favoriet fougere style soap I have used so far. I keep coming back to it. The slickness is not as B&M Reserve or DG Icarus, but it feels comparable to Stirling. It matches really well with my Clubman. The smell is awesome. Green, powered, fresh. It's not the same as Pinaud, but it's in the same ball park.",

I COMPLETELY overloaded today lol. Not just a little, a LOT! I have to say despite the [lack of a] mess (because I'm a shower shaver), I like the way brushes feel when they are overloaded. The puff up and feel like there's more backbone than there really is. Obviously this doesn't work with some brushes that have a ton of backbone already. I've never had this brush do that hah. It works really well with Simpson Best Badger!\nAfter I was done shaving I had so much lather left I squeezed some out and used it for my body, sheeriiit why not?! The Santa Ana winds are coming on strong today, and probably will for the week or so, so may as well get the moisturizing properties from SV all over!\n\nGreat shave today and the sun is shining!!!\n\nHave a good'n folks!!!",

Trying a new scent from Dr Jon's, which started me-likey but ended meh due to a dominance of lady-like notes.\n\n#### Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Fatip - Piccolo Black & Gold Open Comb ::: Feather ‹8 uses›)*\n\nFelt so good on the face. Smooth combo for me. Created just a bit of irritation in the neck, but that was proably the smoothness lulling me into getting too comfortable with it. No tugging whatsoever. I don't think I could even feel the hairs being cut. Love this little smooth operator.\n\n#### Soap Notes\n*^(Dr Jon's - Sunday Funday Extravaganza - Eau de Orsini)*\n\n30 sec loading with a lightly wet badger + 2 tsp water = just the right amount of lather and it was super slick and hydrated. gave razor lots of glide.\n\nScent: I got the neroli, thyme, and maybe the white musk from the dry puck before start. Liked that. My main concern was it being too weak.\n\nHowever, after whipping up the lather (DJ's is so good at getting really hydrated and not breaking down) I found that the notes I liked had retired for the evening, leaving the ugly step-sisters on the dance floor all alone: lilac and seamoss. I did not like, and found myself smelling like a woman. Choosing an unscented balm was wrong this day, I tell you. Later, I would splash on some Stirling City Slicker and be all fixed.\n\nScent strength: 4/10. Lightly present during shave. I was happy about that, at least... even if I didn't like the scent when in lather form.\n\n\n#### Brush Notes\n*^(Declaration Grooming - B5 Badger Rubberset 400)*\n\nSo this is the brush with short loft and high density. I found it harder to work up a lather than with a boar or a more normal silvertip. I also found application on the face a bit tedious as this brush just doesn't seem to work well with lathers on the wet end of the spectrum. I think it just can't hold on to the lather. I dunno. I'll keep watching it.\n\n#### Shave Quality\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Smooth\n*Neck*: Smooth\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Cut flush to where I just see the tips (above average for me)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm)\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

Decided to go with the 610, along with breaking it in the \"normal\" way, thanks to /u/Old_Hiker. It isn't as scratchy as I thought it would be. But holy fuck does this thing stink. It also eats lather like a mofo, but I knew that going in, so I loaded about twice as much as I normally would, and barely had enough for my 2 passes + clean up lather. So as of right now this brush has had two lathers through it (one test lather last night, and then this morning.) Will have to try to remember to keep count, see how long it takes to break in.\n\nHave a nice Sunday everyone!",

My little guy opened the box saying it was a gift from him to me and immediately snatched the pop when he saw it lmao so thanks for the bonus it made his day lol\n\nI can see why the vintage razors are popular if they are all as smooth and efficient as this shave was. A little tricky with the head shave maintaining the bright angles but literally wonderful for the neck shave.\n\nThe SW Lavender has been one of my go to soaps lately when I want a solid and fairly easy lather. The scent reminds me of what the violet candies would smell like if they were available in a lavender variety.\n\nOff to work in a few. Have a good rest of weekend",

I'm starting to get the Icarus base. The Gillette blacks are growing on me as well. 3 passes today and no fear while I went ATG. I love the scent of LFDL on the puck and during the shave. I'll see how the dry down goes but it's sweeter and more powder in the post shave and less forest than I was hoping. Still one of my favorite scents so far. Face feels tremendous at the moment as well. I used less splash than I would toner and made sure my face was wetter and the splash didn't tear my face up. If I love the scent I may go looking for a toner in the next couple days.",

Added a few drops of water and moved to my damp face and the leather just exploded (as much as lather can on a 22mm knot). Density was nice, lots of cushion for the more aggressive (well, more aggressive than the A plate) C plate. Glide was sufficient. Residual slickness was on the low side, though it certainly didn't leave my face dry.\n\nFinished up with my first spray of Santal Auster. Very woody... kind of reminds me of when my grandfather would do woodworking in his garage in North Carolina. There's something in there that smells nothing like pine but is sharp in a way I'm only used to pine sap being sharp. Guess I should look at the scent notes again.",

Technically, the brush was free because I needed $7 to get free shipping, and shipping would have been $6.95 otherwise.\n\nNo issues with the shave. Arko lathered like a beast as usual, and there was plenty of uber-slick lather, so the razor glided effortlessly. I'm lucky that I don't experience drying from any soap, so Arko works great for me. The Pur-Est smells funky at first, but once that fades, it's pleasant and very nourishing to my face. It's pretty much identical to Skin Bracer here in Canada.",

That was a poor choice. Tomorrow will probably be awful.\n\nProraso worked pretty well though! Nice lather, good and slick, but still not much residual slickness once the lather is cleared off with that first pass of the razor.\n\nSpent a few hours going through the list of soaps I own and the list of soaps I've been interested in trying. Used the fragrance data from TryThatSoap and classified all of them into classic fragrance categories, which helped me spot products that looked overly similar. Weeded out any \"try me\" products that were essentially duplicate scents from different companies by just keeping whichever one would likely have the better base / is easier to buy in Canada. The list is looking a lot more manageable now... only about a dozen untried soaps survived the cut.",

I have the old AS formula, so I had to add some Lucky Tiger for the skin food. Have a great start of the week, folks!",

I find it makes a lather better than my Captain's Choice bowl and solves the problem of the lather coming up out of the bowl. I generally face lather, but bowl lathering is pretty handy for dialing in a new soap base and for samples. Excellent face feel post shave from the Southern Witchcrafts, will have to pick up more scents.",

It is so familiar, but I can't seem to actually recall where I've smelled the scent before. It definitely brings thoughts of royalty like the name implies, and smelling this stuff is kind of addictive. I only had a sample of it, and sadly I finished it off this shave. I really want to try more new soaps for my next few purchases, but the urge t to buy a full sized tub of this may prove to be to strong.\n\nOther than the soap nothing otherwise remarkable this shave, just the same reliability I've come to expect from my techs and nacets.\n\nI highly recommend Stirling's aftershave balms, especially this scent t to anyone looking for something bright, and relaxing.",

After a \"successful\" first snowboarding adventure yesterday, my present for today is nursing my bruised butt and knees, but at least nothing broken. Speaking of broken, Mrs breakingthings suffered a nasty fall and hurt her tailbone pretty bad. Hopefully just a bruise though, but must be hurting enough for her to google: difference between broken and bruised tailbone.\n\nLife is short, shave with good gear.",

Holy shit. Did three passes with a straight today for the first time. Plenty of irritation, plenty of stubble left. However, I was able to smooth out most of my biggest trouble spot. Using a straight razor regularly suddenly sounds reasonable. F'yeah!\n\n\n2.) I won't kid you that I listened to *one* song while I was shaving. I played the album and picked one of my favorite songs to post.\n\n\n*Amazing shave today. Wish you all the same*\n\n",

I was planning on a different brush and soap, butt Cella caught my eye. I haven't used it in ages. And to make it more strange, Cella tends to dry me out more than a lot of other soaps I have. And the cold dry air of winter just didn't make using it sound good. I used it anyway. Apart from the drying effect it has always performed really well for me. Today was no different. I loaded like crazy and enjoyed every minute of it.\n\nNow...for the odd stuff. It wasn't nearly as drying as it always has been. What changed? I recently added using CL skin salve as part of my daily routine in addition to my usual Oil of Olay. I used L&L liniment on some days too. The best I can guess is that my skin is less dry from the weather as a result. And not by a little. I have been re-applying the skin salve at least once a day sometimes twice for a total of three applications. It seems to be doing wonderful things for my skin. Hey /u/hawns, good job. Ima be buying more of this stuff next visit to Adrian.",

Fenney Tally Ho\n* **Post:** Stirling - Kaboom splash\n* **Frag:** Herod\n\nThe last time I used Kaboom my neck looked real splotchy and dotted red. Wasn't sure if it was just a bad shave with the RR Baby Smooth or a reaction to the soap. I figured I'd give it another go with Kaboom and use a straight this time... well still undecided. Seemed like I still had some redness but not as bad as before. It's a great scent, I'd hate to have to let it go.\n\nSpeaking of letting it go. I put together a huge box last night of stuff that just hasn't been in rotation for awhile. 26+ items, 20+ brands at least. Thought about throwing it on the Bazaar as a mystery box. But I think I'm going to split it into 2 boxes and PIF one. It will definitely be geared toward new wetshavers but be on the lookout for it :)",

King of Bourbon continues to be my favorite scent, and the Bufala base is basically perfection.\n\nToday kinda sucks, as this weekend our refrigerator went out, and I had to buy a new one. The good news is that we're renting, and are being reimbursed for it, but it still sucks having to throw out 200 bucks worth of food. Oh Well, off to a new week\n\nHappy Shaves Y'all!",

I have no doubt in my mind that the stainless is a little milder and smoother. It had that \"oh shit did I forget to put a blade in?\" feeling. Another thing I noticed is there is almost zero audible feedback. Kind of like a BBS-1 in both senses, however a very different shave. I went for 3 passes and and all went smooth as could be!\n\nThis brush is shaped similar to a Polo, but without the bump in the middle, and more vase-like. The colors compliment each other well, and is nice to look at an hold. The elongated shape is similar in use to a barber style handle, with the obvious differences that come with different shaped handles.\n\nSince we have been having Santa Ana winds all week, I wanted a balm I went with the BP1924 simply because it has a mild tobacco scent, let me emphasize **MILD**. Once it's on it loses most of its scent. It's good for using with different scents I suppose. Either way it's a very nice balm. Goes on smooth and easily, no ~~greedy~~ greasy feeling, and the pleasant scent doesn't hurt! However, I wanted a stronger tobacco scent. I don't have the matching aftershave from MLS (I'll have to grab some next time I place an order with them), the real Santa Maria Novella aftershave yet, or the frag, so I have to make do with Santa Maria Del Fiore. Anyone who has used this, knows the scent is nice, but a little lacking in any other departments one might look for in an aftershave product. It's not like 'Fine' where it's just alcohol water and fragrance, but not much more, with castor oil being the only moisturizing ingredient in sight. Oh well, it smells good haha !\n\nAwesome shave today, ending with similar results as with the Ti version. BBS most of my face, and a little longer in my problem areas. Today is a little more in my problem areas simply because I couldn't quite hear where that area starts, which is a nice feature of, we'll say 'vocal' razors, you can hear what your doing. I'll get it better tomorrow!\n\nHope everyone's Monday is as good as a Monday can be!\n\nEdited to fix spelling and add I don't own the matching MLS aftershave",

A very boar like badger, some loved the Envy for its exfoliating feel (i.e. pokiness) while others excoriated it for being a boar in badger's clothing. There was a wave of less expensive two bands that were firm without being porcupine quills that came out about a year or so after the Envy White's appearance and swept it out of the spotlight.\n* I find it's aged pretty well. No horizontal stragglers, still solidly mounted, center still visibly dense. I don't use any boars in the rotation anymore, so getting poked in the face a bit was pleasantly nostalgic. Brush loaded and dispensed lather efficiently, and the aluminum handle helped the water / lather mix stay warmer than would be expected in a resin handle. All in all, pleasant to use, but easy to see why it did not last long as everyone's favorite brush.",

This is an impressive base that deserves way more attention than it gets. It doesn't have the supper fatty feeling of some soaps, but it's very slick and protective. It's really good. The scent on this is nice too. A smooth lavender, with just a touch of mint that doesn't overwhelm it.",

Terrible idea but now I know it's absolutely not due to my technique but just the way my hair grows back. Just did a quick 2 pass shave and left the goatee because my wife has been requesting it over and over. Honestly, any woman that likes a goatee is sus as fuck. Who is this woman I married? Goatee's are certified creeper territory. 100% of all amber alerts take place with a man with a goatee. 100% of all Megan's Law profile pics include a male with a goatee. These are facts people. So again, who have I married? Surely someone who likes creeps. And boy did she ever find one. I'm right up her alley I guess. Anyway, Hyva inspired me to shave with Barrbarr and follow the splash up with chatty salve. He did not do me dirty. Excellent combo. A little greasy at first but my face is soft as shit and I'm going to bed so it'll be absorbed by morning time and I'll have a baby ass cheek face so that will be cool. Cheers to Tuesday and fucking Monday in the ass pipe.",

      "body": "**2019-01-29 SOTD: Stirling Sample #5/10**\n\n**Prep:** Took a shower\n\n**Brush:** AP Shave Co Luxury Badger-Boar Fan, 24mm\n\n**Lather:** Stirling Sharp Dressed Man\n\n**Razor:** 1955 Ball End Tech\n\n**Blade:** Wilkinson Sword, German (shave #6)\n\n**Post:** Nivea Sensitive goop\n\n> Thoughts:\n\n**The Brush...**\n\nI got this Badger/Boar brush a week ago and promptly got to work breaking it in:\n\n1. Washed it with some gentle dish soap and let it sit and soak for about an hour (to fight of animal smells).\n\n2. Lathered up some Stirling Noir and let the brush sit overnight with the soap in the bristles; apparently the lanolin helps to soften up the hair, and the perfume in the soap certainly masked any remaining animal smell.\n\n3. Every day for the rest of the week, soaked the brush for a few hours in cold water and then quickly but gently scrubbed the bristle tips on a terry towel for ~15 minutes [while watching YouTube videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUcyEsEjhPEDf69RRVhRh4A). This helped split the boar hair ends quite effectively and had no visible impact on the badger hairs. Fresh out of the box, this knot felt like a broom. Broken in and soaked for usage, it's lovely and soft.\n\nHowever, it's fuckin' huge compared to my Vie Long horse brush and I've had trouble finding a suitable lather vessel. I tried out my Fendrihan shave mug today and no dice: there wasn't enough room to maneuver the brush and build up a decent lather. I don't know if it's because the lather was built so poorly or if it's just the tendency of this brush, but it felt like I was scrubbing as much lather *off* my face as I was depositing onto it every time I tried to lather up, regardless of whether I was trying to face lather or just paint it on. Very disappointing performance so far. Needs more experimentation I guess.\n\n**The Lather Scent...**\n\nSpeaking of lather, this is actually my second time lathering up this soap to check out the scent, since this one seems pretty divisive. Some people rate it as one of the top Stirling scents - I'd agree, to an extent: it smells great to shave with but it's not a fragrance that I want to *wear.* It took a lot of sniffing to figure out what it smells like, especially because it's the middle of the damned winter and my yard is buried in a thick layer of snow, but I've finally decided this soap is a dead ringer for the way my garden smells when my lilies are in bloom. [Not quite the way it's described on TryThatSoap](https://trythatsoap.com/collection/117/?product_type=soap), but I suppose that all the scent notes add up to smell a lot like my garden. I supposed that if this is what \"real men smell like,\" as Stirling says, then my garden must be hella manly.\n\nFive more Stirling scents to go (well... maybe 6), and then I'll post a summary of my thoughts.\n\n**The Shave...**\n\nAnother shave with my 1955 Tech and the same Wilkinson blade as last time. My last two shaves with this combo were two of the closest shaves I've ever had with any razor ever, but they were also not the most gentle (due to user error). I paid more attention to what I was doing today (especailly because the lather was so pathetic) and was rewarded with another nice close shave in two passes with very little touch-up work: BBS all over the face and DFS on the neck. I'm enjoying this combination of razor and blade. I don't know if it'll end up being *the best combo* out of all my gear, but it's certainly *good enough for a close, gentle shave* and that's what counts, right? \"Perfect is the enemy of good enough.\"",

I was only able to get the splash instead of the set, so I figured I'd pair it with Civet after taking a good sniff of the splash. Civet is the closest thing to a true sweet smell in my collection and I think the sweet and musky scent really blended well with the sugary sweetness of the splash. Speaking of the splash, it smells like candy on my face and I do think I love it! I chose to not use a frag today because I wanted to see just how long the scent will linger on my face because it comes out fairly strong when splashed on. Either way, I'm glad I finally got to get my hands on a Mammoth scent! Hope everyone has a great day!",

In order to find out which one I like better I've decided to pit them against each other over the next 3-4 shaves. Each razor gets a fresh new Astra SP and I'll switch which side each razor shaves each day. I'll come back with an edit to reveal the results each day.\n\nEdit: the \"Canadian\" won this round. With a new blade it was an incredible cutter. Not much blade feel but my hair was almost gone with the first pass and the XTG and ATG were effortless. The British had more blade feel and audible feedback but did not cut as close and caused slight irritation.",

At least the snow looks good!\n\n\nHave a great one, everyone!",

The Lady of the Night is a Philippines variant of jasmine known for its powerful scent and night blooming. This is a great scent from Eufros, and creates a whole little scent world for jasmine, full of smoky / sweet / floral / green notes. The Eufros base is top notch also.\n* Brush: Part of my \"obscure brushes\" theme for the week. Just before they passed into the great corporate afterlife, Shave Revolution had a collaboration with WW and put their knots in a special goblet style resin brush handle from SR.\n* Things did not work out all that well. I actually had a SR Manchurian knot in a more generic handle from the brand and liked it. So I thought getting that same knot in a really nice handle was a no-brainer.\n* Meh. Knot was set too deep in the handle, and so has minimal loft, which makes for poor splay, an extra long load time, and a visually unimpressive \"pinhead\" design where the hulking handle is topped with a knot that looks much smaller than its 24mm size would suggest.\n* Still works out ok, as the handle is great to use, and the knot is serviceable if not stunning, but this was squandered potential. I'll probably get a reknot one day, if I care enough to do so. I have a few other brushes lying around, so having one underperformer in the inventory is not especially troubling.",

I'm shocked at how well this blade is still working after 34 shaves. Back when my technique was more shaky, I'd have never imagined this.

At least the office will likely be closed. Happy Tuesday shaves, all.",

Finally took the plunge with Maggard's 10% coupon and it arrived yesterday. First impression: nice! Close and comfortable shave that I expect to get even better with more mileage. No trouble finding the correct angle, though it did feel a little more handle-down than my vintage injectors.\n\nThe remains of this Tabac puck are hanging on for dear life.

Was a little on the fence about bay rum scents before I bought this, but given how much I enjoy the performance of other CFG soaps/splashes, I was willing to blind buy without sampling. It's really grown on me. One thing I've noticed is that the bay rum splash is more bracing than others I've tried in the CFG line. Not to the point that it's uncomfortable, but more than I'm used to. I do enjoy the menthol addition though. I can even feel it tingle between my fingers 10-15 mins after a shave, if I didn't wash them off thoroughly.",

WooHoo!!!\n\nThis brush is interesting. The handle is made of 'Krion' which is a man made material composed of mostly natural minerals, and some man made resin. It feels like a natural material, or almost like porcelain. It's naturally anti bacterial, and feels cold to touch! Pretty cool material ! =) The knot is borderline false advertising, to my advantage lol. The specs through Vie-Long are 27mmx50mm bulb. Well according to my caliper, it's more like 30mmx49mm, DENSE, and the bulb is perfectly shaped. It looks a little like a golf ball, but a bit bigger. Face feel is awesome, just enough feel of the hairs, and has a solid backbone. The tips don't have an over bleached appearance, so I highly doubt it will ever get a 'gel' feel, but still extremely soft. I much prefer this to over the processed hairs that do have a gel-like feeling. Win win!!!\n\nToday's shave was DFS, exactly what I wanted!\n\nHappy Shaving! See You Next Tuesday!!!\n=P",

The Semogue 1250 is coming up real nicely. It's blooming like no other and is starting to get softer and softer. It is still a bit scritchy compared to my Omega boar but manageable. The Razor and blade combo goes pretty well. No real irritation and smooth yet sharp enough shave. Let's see how long that Astra SS lasts.\n\nAs for the soap, it's starting to grow on me. The performance of Artisan Soap Shoppe (Tallow) are always great but their scents have been hit or miss for me. This soap was one of the miss because it smelled like an old cabin/furniture. But it's a unique scent. An old time station scent and it's one of a kind. Glad I got it. And the post shave of Thayer's + Stirling Balm is amazing. Always works great for my skin. Overall, a great shave!",

It was a 3D design of his and he printed it right up! It was fun to work with him a little bit and make a few tiny tweaks to his excellent design.\n\nIn honor of that, I chose some of my favorite pieces to shave with.\n\n#### Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Karve - Christopher Bradley A Plate ::: Astra - Platinum ‹9 uses›)*\n\nA smooth match made in heaven. Great combo.\n\nNo tugging or irritation. Predictable, efficient cutting.\n\n#### Soap Notes\n*^(Fine Accoutrements - Santal Absolut)*\n\nOne of my favorite scents ever. And this puck gives me such great lather very easily. Great creamy feel and super slick.\n\nTried something new tonight and still got 2-3 times as much lather as I needed. soaked the soap in 2 tsp of water for several minutes, because I then added that to my lather bowl, thereby not wasting any soap. Then a 30 sec load (will try 15 next time) and ended up putting 4-5 tsp of water to make the lather.\n\nLather was amazing. So rich and creamy. Rival any top-tier soap... seriously.\n\nLove this sandalwood scent. Strength was a nice 5-6/10, making it very enjoyable during the shave.\n\n\n#### Brush Notes\n*^(Golden Nib - Silvertip Premium 22mm)*\n\nFlowy, soft, low backbone cloud of a brush. Love it.\n\n#### Shave Quality\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Smooth\n*Neck*: Smooth\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Few hairs are showing some tip length (with most being cut flush)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm)\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

(+ Stirling unscented Glacial balm)\n\n**Frag:** Stirling Soap Co. - Executive Man\n\n**Song:** [Slipknot - The Heretic Anthem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ha4mnVEzv2g)\n\nSlipknot is about as close to metal as I'm willing to get, although /u/shredsofmetal did give me a list of stuff to dip my toes in. In the name of expanding my horizons and shit. Ya dig? I used to bump this track when I was on my way to work, waiting tables in college. Got me so fucking pumped up...to serve mediocre pizza.\n\n*Regarding the lather:* Very impressed on the first run. On the Sniff Test, the first thing I noticed is that there is something animalistic here, and not just beef tallow. Something else. Something wild. Something that could kill you if you pissed it off. I won't venture a guess as to what it might be (and hell, I could be completely off the mark with the animal thing) but I have a set of Shhh! (no TryThatSoap page) which is the SBS unscented soap. It does *not* smell anything like [Kyle's Secret Stuff. ](https://imgur.com/8HsgoiZ)\n\nThe star of the show today was the face feel. Someone mentioned to me in a PM that it's similar to Noble Otter and I agree. It's fatty and thick. It feels like it's *working* when it's sitting on your face. I stood still for a minute and could almost hear it doing its thing, before the unmitigated depression and inward screaming came roaring back. But that's my therapists problem.\n\nGood shit, /u/rocketk455. Back to the v1 base tomorrow for more comparison testing.\n\nHappy Hump Day, everyone. That thing you were gonna dominate but didn't due to whatever contrived reason you came up with? Do that thing today. Make your momma proud, eh?",

I am not a particularly big fan of sandalwood, but it has grown on me a little over the years. This cream performs pretty good, really. I mean it's not like Baum.be, Cade Rich (r.i.p.) or Castle Forbes, but it doesn't have their price tag either. I consider it a good value. The price to performance ratio is pretty good.\n\nDamn it's cold. Wild chill as low as -40F this morning. Good thing I put on the CL skin salve. I'm actually going to take it to work with me too.

The stink is going away but still scratchy and pokey. Reserve Waves smells like what my dad wore when I was a wee lad.\n\nI was woken up this morning at 3:00 by my wife texting me that she got to work safely, and that she almost didn't make it out of the driveway thanks to the snow drift. When I went to bed it was forecasted for 1-3 inches of snow. When I actually hauled my ass out of bed, at 4:30, it was more like 6 inches. Had to make sure the neighbor could get out, so put on the snow gear and went out to snow blow. Got back in to a voicemail saying that there is a 2-hour delay for school.\n\nHave a nice Wednesday everyone!",

Haven't listened to Simple Plan since high school... heard a song that sounded like them over the weekend, and thought \"why not\" and gave them a listen. Took me straight back to freshman year and all the silly emotions of 14 year old scribe. Fun fact: Mark Hoppus of Blink 182 does gust vocals in this song.

The two shaves I've used it for have been great. Even if the head is the same as a 40s superspeed, I seem to notice a slight increase in aggression, maybe because of the increased weight to the handle. Either way it's a beautiful razor, that shaves great.\n\nI love this soap as well. I can't recommend it more highly to those that love a citrus scent. The base is the real star though, it's the only duck fat base I've tried, and it is one of the slickest soaps I've tried to date.\n\nNo. 63 is an amazing scent. It reminds me of spicebomb by Viktor and Rolf. I'm really I happy with the EdT it's actually probably a little nicer than spicebomb, or at least a bit more complex. I could smell this all day, just amazing.",

Oaken is in Indonesia apparently and claims to make their own base and scents. This was the most interesting of the three scents at the store, a blend of exotic woods, tobacco, and vanilla. Uses vanillin, so white badger tips beware!\n* Performance was very good, not quite excellent, somewhere between Noble Otter and Glissant. Lather creation was easy and slickness was fine. Protection and post shave were a bit lacking.\n* Scent is most of the appeal here, creating a blend of earth and wood with a pleasant sweetness from the vanilla. A fine scent, pretty unique in shaving.\n* Of special note was the packaging - same bottom half, the tub that Shaver Heaven and APR also use (a Southern Hemisphere thing?) but lid is lightweight metal, unique and a bit classier than plastic. Excellent graphic design on the label also, but no ingredients given.\n* Value? At $25 for 4 ounces, this is on the hefty side for something that does as well as Noble Otter which is priced at $16 for the same four ounces. Noble Otter has some very good scents also, so paying $9 more to support the costly importation of a soap from the other side of the Earth may not be entirely practical, even given the nice and relatively unique scent.\n* **Brush**: From the back of the shelf --- Interesting design and I love the wood handle. The knot appears to be a Rytmo clone, but apparently not the exact same one as Maggards / BOSS/ GameChanger. Anyway, the knot performed great. Should use this one more often, but I already have an authentic Rytmo and a nice aluminum GameChanger in the rotation, so the Paragon may continue to languish.\n* **Frag**: One of Dior's most polarizing masculines. Depends on how you feel about the scent of orris...",

I like the lightness but I feel like I could break the razor.. Unforgiven is great. The birch tar and the patchouli give it a herbal/medicinal kick.

It's complex but subtle enough to be inoffensive to all. I had no issues obtaining a really great lather.\n\nOn the brush front, one thing that I've noticed is that my preferences have changed over the past few months since transitioning to badger brushes on my face. The Omega 10049 which once felt very large and still does, does not have the density and lather retention that I've grown to like from the badger brushes. I'll continue using the 10049 on my head even though it splays a bit more than I would like but still serves its purpose.",

Good backbone and the tips are the softest I have ever felt. It's like the previous owner just had this baby soaking in conditioner.

And no, I'm not done with the 120 Nacet. It's just good to alternate a bit. I also grabbed one of the samples that has been staring at me for a month or so. My first time with Wickham, and I'm impressed.\n\n#### Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Gillette - Aristocrat 16 - UK ::: Feather ‹10 uses›)*\n\nGreat combo. Excellent result. Virtually no irritation or tugging. This blade for me right now is cutting so close that I have to be careful, and sometimes leaves me a little tender in a few spots. But pretty much not a big deal. Looking forward to when it smooths out a bit more. This razor is a gem.\n\n#### Soap Notes\n*^(Wickham 1912 - Russian Leather)*\n\nThis is a good soap. I got an excellent lather, and most of all, a nice strong scent! So rare with American artisans. I'm guessing I only need 2/3 of my 1/4 tsp measure, which makes it more economical than many of the top-tier soaps. Definitely worth checking out more, especially when you find a CONUS supplier.\n\n1/4 tsp soap + lightly wet small boar brush+ 5.5 tsp water = 6-7 passes of super slick and well-hydrated lather. Held it's water really well and showed off the elasticity.\n\nScent was leathery, with a cologne type element that does feel like old world Russia.\n\nScent strength was a delightful 6-7/10. I was able to enjoy it during the whole shave and it could not be escaped... in a good way.\n\nI intend to get some more Wickham samples, to figure out which one to bring into my den.\n\n\n#### Brush Notes\n*^(Semogue - 1800 Boar)*\n\nSo this is just the second use and already it is a comfortable brush. Another 3 hour soak before use. Held lather well and was a delight to use.\n\n#### Shave Quality\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Cut flush to where I just see the tips (above average for me)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm)\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

Rec'd both of these techs as throw-ins on a recent trade. Decided to bring them along on a short biz trip. First pass was with the fat handle, which has seen better days but cleaned up OK. Very mild and unfortunately not very efficient--more stubble remaining after first pass than I'm used to. Switched to the travel tech for the remainder and it worked better. It was a passable shave--harder on my neck than usual (alum was barking at me), but got the job done. Glad I got a chance to try these out but neither will displace my Game Changer. Off to the races.",

Super thick, super luxurious, and a great postshave. BBS shave except for a DFS on my neck, which is exactly what I shoot for, as there's no irritation. Great shave.\n\nHappy Shaves Y'all!",

Wasn't terrible but I for sure had less comfort than usual.\n\nI'm a sucker for clean, fresh scents and Sapones Lime and Basil hits that mark. It was the first non canned soap I ever bought and I use it about once a week. It's such an easy soap to lather and takes very little time to get the slickness I want even though it may not reach the slickness of other soaps.",

Temperatures bottomed out at 26 below with a wind chill of 55 below. My office is closed, so I'm enjoying the day in my sweatpants beside my dog. I needed a warm shave, and Nocturne soap + Bon Vivant post shave and EdT really did the trick. I haven't used this scent as often as I ought to this winter. It's my only CL salve in the old formula, received from the Bazaar a few months back. I'll be working it into the rotation more often. I smell like a tasty whiskey beverage.\n\nStay warm, and happy Wednesday shaves, all!",

I *think* it came in a small lot, who knows...I do know it's pretty old because it's in a tin rather than a glass jar, which is how they're served up now. I don't even know if they're making it anymore *shrug\nAnyhow, this is a Tallow based soap, butbthe I gradients aren't listed on the labels. I'm sure they're somewhere online, but I can't be bothered.\n\nPerformance was excellent! It loaded very quickly (something I wasn't expecting having been sitting for as long as it has been), to a nice rich, creamy pre-lather. Moving to my face it went just as easily adding a little water a few times. The result was a nice shiny lather with a medium density. First pass was smooth as could be! My razor glided along just as it has been. The second pass the lather was a little thinner, and thinner still for the third pass. None of the thinning affected the shave...still nice and smooth. The post shave is very nice as well, absolutely ZERO complaints!\n\nThe scent on this one is supposed to be Vetiver, Lavender, and Anise. I don't pick up any anise, but the lather itself has a little bit of a musky vibe to me. I recognize the scent, and I cannot put my finger on where I know it from. Sigh.\n\nSeeing as I don't have a matching post shave for this (Is grab one if there was one, I really enjoy this scent!), I had to get creative. So I went with a good bit of the Reserve Classic and a little of the Lavanille Tonique to add a little warmth. The match isn't perfect, but it's close enough for me =)\n\nDamn fine shave today with a new soap, and a new to me scent profile. Hell yeah!!!\n\nHappy shaving all!!!",

I've wracked my brain over and over again and can't think of anything that works right!

Oh and I paid closer attention to my technique with the Autostrop and am still pushing along quite well with my first Feather FHS blade in there.

      "body": "**2019-01-29 Theme Thursday SOTD: Cheapest Shave Evah!**\n\nCheapest shave ever, eh? How about a full-featured luxury shave made entirely out of free samples and a gifted brush?\n\n**Prep:** Took a shower\n\n**Brush:** Vie Long 22mm Horse (a thoughtful gift from my parents when first bought a safety razor)\n\n**Pre-shave:** Art of Shaving unscented pre-shave oil sample (freebie from a Fendrihan order)\n\n**Lather:** Art of Shaving unscented shaving cream (another freebie from a Fendrihan order)\n\n**Razor:** [\"Mach 3 Compatible Razor\" - a freebie that Rocky Mountain Barber shipped with some pomade](https://rockymountainbarber.ca/collections/add-on-samples/products/rocky-mountain-barber-razor-handle)\n\n**Blade:** [\"Mach 3 Compatible Cartridge\" - another freebie, came with the razor](https://rockymountainbarber.ca/collections/add-on-samples/products/rocky-mountain-barber-razor-blades-2-pack) which is [the same as this cartridge that shows up in a lot of store brands here in Canada](https://www.amazon.ca/RightFit-Cartridges-Compatible-Gillette-Sensitive/dp/B072P5VGC2/)\n\n**Post:** Art of Shaving unscented after-shave balm (yet another Fendrihan freebie)\n\n**Total Cost to Me:** $0\n\n**The Goops:** I've never used a pre shave oil before. I used too much. Gross. Seemed to help maintain residual slickness though. Not actually scent free, just un-perfumed; it had a faint peppery scent of cypress or cedar, I'd say. The shave cream was excellent too and whipped up a thick creamy lather faster than almost any other soap I own. Nice. The aftershave balm was acceptable but no better than Nivea. I used too much again by accident.\n\n**The Razor & Shave:** Honestly guys, I kind of love this POS cheap razor. It isn't as precise or nimble as my safety razors (it's hard to use under the nose and accurately tidy up sideburns) but it DOES give me a very close shave with little to no irritation. Today, for example: smoothest BBS shave I've had in a long time in just 2 passes. BBS everywhere and no whisker irritation anywhere. Even my problem patch and neck. I'm sure I'll feel a little burn at the skin surface later and I'm gonna pay hell when the whiskers start piercing out through the skin that grew right over them, but for a few hours today my face shall feel glorious. I'd say this is a good \"special occasions\" razor but I know I can't use it all the time.\n\nThat said, I'd rather spend my shaving funds on [tasty-smelling shave soaps](http://www.cellamilano.it/en/shaving-products/shaving-cream) and [cute little boxes of blades](http://www.tryablade.com/blade/lord-classic-super-stainless) than on ugly, overpriced cartridges. I only have this ugly bugger because it was free.",

In keeping with cheapest shave evah!, I used what I would consider cheap w/o having to be on the verge of poor quality (looking at you williams). Also, given that it was pretty cold here in western new york, I used \"cold products\" just to turn it up to 11. Outside temp during shave was 0degF, windchill made it ~ -20-25degF\n\n**Razor**: Maggard V3 with MR8 handle (cheaper reazor, less than $20)\n\n**Blade**: Wilkinson sword (from a 100pk, so cheap)\n\n**Soap**: Proraso green (tub was $7 and will last forever so pennies of soap)\n\n**Brush**: Le Maison du Barbier (Plisson) synthetic\n\n**A/S**: Proraso green, a good scent for me in that it is fleeting and fixes the issue of proraso being drying to my skin.\n\n**ATG/UTN**: Braun s320 foil - this is the ATG pass under the nose, which is the best method to get BBS for me as my skin will not handle a razor ATG/UTN.\n\nA very nice shave. Proraso is decent enough and low cost. To go cheaper would be arko but I had to go with a \"cold\" shave. Arko is ok but the scent can be a bit much for my nose.\n\nEdit: forgot the brush",

      "body": "Thursday 1/31/19 SOTD\n\nThoroughly forgot about the theme today, due to the frigid temps in and outside my house. (Never live on top of a parking garage! No insulation, no heat. Fine for the cars, bad for those walking around on top of that space...)\n\nBut in any case, my razor today was among my cheapest ones, so I am kind of compliant.\n\n* Razor: RazoRock Hawk 2 AC\n* Blade: Feather Pro AC (6)\n* Soap: Nuavia Blu\n* Brush: 24mm Cashmere in APS faux marble handle\n* Post: Cremo Cooling Post Shave Balm\n* Frag: Lauren Polo (Green) EDT\n\nProduct Notes:\n\n* Razor / Blade: Infamy! The Hawk proved to be the first razor that could not give me a 2 pass BBS since my 2019 exercise began. The blade and soap are reliable, so the razor must be the issue. Got a DFS, not awful, but other combos have worked much nicer.\n* Soap: Nuavia is no longer the dominant force it once was, as bases like Reserve and Eufros outclass it for less cost. The technicals are still great though, far better than pricey senior rival MdC. The Nuavia scent is also among best in class though, a complex, elegant, and powerful design. (So powerful that I always use a synth with Nuavia; the scent lingers on a badger forever!)\n* Brush: The Cashmere is always a pleasure - somehow feels both softer and also less mushy than a Plisson class brush, and the albino white appearance is quite the trompe l'oeil as the French would say, as the eye thinks \"boar\" while the skin says \"softer than badger\". A pleasant combo, lacking the \"shelf presence\" of some other rivals due to the generic handle. And thus relegated to the back of the closet usually. (Does make a fine travel brush though!)\n* Frag: Always amazes me that this was one of America's favorite masculines for many years. It's a dark and powerful scent, sort of a heart of the deep cold woods effect. Makes me think I'm a Druidic executioner, which is a good way to feel on a negative 20 degree morning. Still, hard to believe that a lot of folks liked this, but apparently they did - and in the Pretty In Pink 80s at that! Kind of counter-intuitive.",

The Star razor was a pif and probably when it was out the msrp was a couple bucks. Great shave all around.",

Smooth but efficient. Handled this inexpensive blade well. No tugging or irritation, except maybe a little brush burn.\n\n#### Soap Notes\n*^(Irish Spring - Bar Soap)*\n\nThis is a reasonable shave soap. Not creamy, but slick, cheap, and smells good.\n\n45 sec load in my hand + via a scrubby boar + 2 tsp (can't remember, maybe 4) water = just enough lather to complete the job, and maybe a pass left.\n\n\n#### Brush Notes\n*^(Stirling - Boar 24mm Factory Seconds)*\n\nStill a scrubby little guy, maybe irritating my skin during the second and third passes if I swirl very much. Lack of creaminess from the soap didn't help either. I'm sure it will improve as tips split more. Still a young 'un!\n\n#### Shave Quality\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Few hairs are showing some tip length (with most being cut flush)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm)\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

This was my third shave on this blade; first one wasn't bad, but it was before my father-in-law's wake and I cut my finger changing the blade so I was a bit distracted. Second shave wasn't great either, but I figured maybe I needed to double-down my efforts on technique since I'm new after all. Went back and forth about changing the blade before this shave, but I thought I should be able to get at least 3 shaves out the blade, right? Wrong. Got through the top of my face without an issue, but my neck is always the tricky spot. First pass with the Astra blade was torture and left a ton of uncut hairs as well. Immediately switched the blade out to one of the Derby Extra blades I've been using since I switched to wet shaving and was immediate relief.\n\nI'm new and this Astra was the first blade I've tried other than the Derby's that came with my EJ89. However, I'm only about a dozen shaves in so far. I figured I'd go back to the Derby and let my face calm down before trying a different blade again. Maybe a GSB or Feather this time around, or maybe something a little less common like the PolSilver or Vokshod.\n\nThanks for the new ~~hobby~~ addiction guys!",

Woke up around midnight to a toothache. I laid in bed trying to go back to sleep and ignoring it. Then it kept getting worse and worse and I had to get up and drop 2 naproxen. Then it really started to hurt! I flossed, brushed, and rinsed with mouthwash to try to remove anything that may have been irritating my tooth (see cavity). The pills eventually kicked in and I was able to get some sleep.\n\nNow I'm writing this with this light ache in my tooth, nothing severe, and I'll be able to ignore it once I start doing some real work.\n\nI guess that's what happens when I ignore aches and pains, even though they eventually go away.\n\nTake care of yourselves!",

This is an older version, 4.1, and it's awesome. Loads easily, makes a rich creamy lather that's slick enough to sell me on the brand as a whole. They've since updated their formula twice, and each version is better and better. The newer versions are a little softer and wear faster, but it's absolutely worth the trade off. It's still a hard soap, just a little softer. The end results are a slicker soap, and an even better post shave face feel, which was already at the top tier for me. It seems a little pricey at about $36 bucks a tin, but absolutely worth it. It lasts a long time, so that makes up for it. Some are available as a boxed puck as well at a slightly lower price.\n\nIt's a little chillier here today, overcast, and is supposed to rain again today, and possibly tomorrow and Saturday. Whatevs!!! I had a DFS and am happy to have the rain here!\n\nHave a great day folks!",

This shave is only \"affordable\" because the Reserve Spice set was a Christmas gift and the ATT razor was a generous PIF. My two brushes are this synthetic from Stirling (one of their factory seconds discounted ones) and an Omega boar, so this one is my cheapest by default. Blades are dirt cheap of course, so all in, I think I'm at about $12.05 with the $11.99 brush and an estimated 6 cents for the blade. :) I'll take it!\n\nOur office reopened at noon so it's back to work for a day and a half. Happy Thursday shaves, all!\n\nEdit: The Rose Santal EdT was a late addition... just because the shave needed a little oomph with the cold weather outside. It doesn't fit the theme but... oh well.",

I'm also trying out several new products for me which are the Parker 26C, Derby Extra blades, and Yaqi Silvertip.\n\n**Stirling soaps** usually work really well for me. The Tallow + Lanolin is an amazing combination that gives a very slick and fatty lather. But for Sharp Dressed Man, it turned out a bit lighter than I expected. It might be because it's a older formulation (I got it from Bazaar and I think it's an older one). Or maybe something in the scent that messes with the lather? Not sure but I got a pretty decent lather with it, just not the ideal one.\n\n**The Parker 26C and Derby Extra** combination was okay. The razor felt a bit more aggressive than I would like but no nicks or cuts anywhere. The blade felt dragging on some parts of my neck. It could be that the blade is not sharp enough but I'll have to see on different shaves. It felt close to Shark SS, neither sharp or smooth for me.\n\n**The Yaqi Silvertip.** I felt like I was massaging a small ball against my face, in a good way. Very soft and very dense. I have nothing to complain against the brush other than it takes up whole lotta lather. My 2nd and 3rd pass was skimped compared to my first but still a good bit to work with. Great brush to be honest.\n\n**The Aftershave Portion** is one of my favorite. Lucky Tiger has some great products and the Face Tonic has to be my all time favorite aftershave splash. Tangerine scent with smooth application on my face.\n\nI forgot about the **cheapest shave** portion but it turned out cheaper than the usual. Even the silvertip is one of the best bang for buck out there so that's that. :)",
