But in the end, there were too many hairs left standing with a little length to them, beside my adam's apple. We'll see if the blade bounces back! No pulling at all, and only minuscule irritation found during the alcohol splash application.\n\n## Soap Notes\n*^(MdC - Fougere)*\n\nMy first time trying MdC, and this sample provided by a fellow online shaver made a very nice lather. The scent for this fougere was very nice, and fairly masculine. However, the only problem was that it just wasn't strong enough for me to really enjoy it during the shave. Especially considering the high cost of this soap.\n\nBut...\n\nI thought this was expensive, and it is at first ($60 ordered from maker in Europe). However, it seems that the 200g you get will last one year or more. So that probably puts it at a competitive level with many top-tier artisan croaps out there.\n\n\n## Brush Notes\n*^(Semogue - Badger)*\n\nI think this brush may be better suited, for me at least, for use with a comfortable razor that doesn't rough up my skin as much. On the third pass, these tips start to \"burn\" me just a little. But the first and second passes were very nice.\n\n## Shave Quality\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Very Close Shave\n*Neck*: Many hairs show whisker tips with a little length to them\n\n----\n\n# Ending of Blades Ledger\n\nUse this to document how long our blades last, if you want, and what about them made us pitch 'em. I created a Google Form with just a few questions:\n\n[Ending of Blades Ledger](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform)\n\n[The Ledger Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing) in case you want to just look at the data.\n\nI'll keep this as my footer each SOTD so you have the link. I'll take it down if no one shows interest.",

The WK soap base is top notch and I really like the deceptive complexity in the Cuero Oscuro scent. Cuero Oscuro has a prominent dark leather note that is rather medicinal in the tub. However, this mellows and notes of coffee and smoke make an appearance once the soap is lathered. The Moroccan Leather fragrance blends nicely. As the name suggests, it's very leather forward but the leather note is softened with ylang-ylang and a hint of spice (mainly ginger and pepper to my nose). A perfect shave and a great fragrance to start the week☺",

The lather, of course, was effortless and excellent, it's really good at making a dull blade feel like new again.\n\nGood shaving, guys.\n\n",

But I think it has seen a great deal more use than the Franko.\n\nThe Wolfman still continues to elude me as the \"end-all-be-all\" razor that many make it out to be. Having read that it is one of those razors that pretty much has to be a daily driver for it to click, I am going to hunker down and try and use this until either it clicks or I get frustrated enough to sell it on the Bazaar.\n\nOver all a decent shave, hopefully they will get better as the month progresses.

But it was just sort of random since I had no idea what I would like. There were a couple of things that I regretted not buying and Darkfall was number one on that list. So I ordered a tub of this last week and meant to try it over the weekend but a series of unfortunate events resulted in going about four days between shaves. That made this mornings shave pretty satisfying because I hate having that much growth. But the Darkfall is certainly interesting. I had to look up the notes because it smells fairly similar to Gatlinburg but different enough. It doesn't appear that they actually share a single note, so that is interesting that I find them so similar. The Darkfall does have a sweeter scent to it and a little less of the smokiness. I really have struggled with lathering the Icarus base (previously with Shore and now with this). I put a scoop in a bowl and loaded it up since it was a new tub and I wanted to make sure I liked it before I loaded from the tub. The first two passes the lather was kind of thin and perfectly slick enough and still gave me a good shave, but just seemed off. So for the third pass, I added some more water and loaded for a few more seconds what was left in the bowl and BAM, loads of great lather. It seems that I stopped working it just a few minutes too early. Honestly I was ready to write off Icarus after struggling with it so far, but that third pass was absolutely fabulous. Even with four days of growth, I didn't have any irritation and got a fantastic shave. I paired it with the Gatlinburg balm since I didn't get the Darkfall aftershave-although I will likely add it now that I like the soap. So a great Monday shave to ease the gloom of a pretty dreadful weekend.",

Every single one. It's that good. A truly perfect shave today, and the lavender scent is really nice on a dreary, rainy, windy, 50 degree Monday morning where staying in bed sounded better than going to work.\n\nAlso, the things I would do for a Reserve Unscented soap. Given my early experience with both scent and toner quality, I think you'd see a lot of Reserve Unscented + Chatillon Lux toner shaves from me, if that ever became an option.\n\nAnyway, game 163 on deck for the Brewers today down at Wrigley Field. Will be tough to focus on work with that game in the headphones this afternoon. Happy Monday, all. Go Brewers!",

I have folded it in half (it was like 4\"x4\"x0.75\" to begin with) and intend to continue using it.\n\nWhen I mentioned on IRC last night that I intended to shave with Darkfall Icarus and a B6 brush this morning, the man himself declared that if I didn't have a great shave today, I had no one but myself to blame. I pointed out that I could still blame him for failing to produce a Declarazor. Luckily, I had an excellent shave. It was my first experience with the Icarus base, so I need a couple more shaves before I can really comment on it. However, I am currently BBS and free of irritation, so something must have gone right.",

Avoided overshaving in spots that I normally need touch up in with a DE and things worked well - no stubble nor pain.\n\n* Soap: If evil Jedi forced me to shave with a light saber, my one request would be that I be allowed to use Reserve soap. The most pleasant and trouble free base I own. My one regret about Purple Possum is that its existence means the entire line is not converting to Reserve base!\n\n* Brush: On sale at Maggot's. Beautiful little brush, weighty handle. The initial 45 second lather stupefied the poor teeny thing, and he needed a lot of added water to create usable lather, but once things got started, they ended well. Very efficient distribution. soft face feel, splayed easily, minimal springiness. I do like Rytmo more than Muhle STF (which I think is the idea behind the two lines) but in truth performance is verrry similar to that of the made in China Gamechanger, so all the Muhle hype about uber brushes from der Vaterland seems a bit overwrought. Still, great performance, well made, and cute in a Teutonic sort of way.\n\n* Frag: The Poor Man's Chanel Egoiste. Amazingly similar scent for maybe half the price...",

Conk shaving soaps (amber, lime, almond, and bay rum) and a variety pack of razors, so I had to give something a try tonight.\n\nThe perfecto, is definitely a closer shave than the chieftain, although it doesn't have that nice heavy solid feel when you hold it. I really liked the bay rum scented soap, and plan to use the almond in the morning.\n\nI believe my preshave cleaner and also another after shave I ordered should be arriving tomorrow, so that's going to be nice to have. Wednesday I should be getting my vetelli toiletry bag to keep all my stuff in so it's a big week for my shaving supplies.",

I really enjoyed the non-traditional Barbershop type scent and boy oh boy is the donkey milk the real deal. This was my first time using a Wholly Kaw soap so I did not know what to expect. The sample was softer than any of the other artisan soaps I've tried and would say it's closer to a croap. I was able to whip up a fantastic lather in no time which says something due to my hard water. The lather was dense and creamy with plenty of slickness and cushion. I really enjoyed this one and will add it to the list.\n\nWest Coast Shaving's Oriental was equally impressive as its description of a spiced rose woods scent is spot on. Although to my nose the scent is blended very well and the spice is very subtle. I picked up the canard base as I really enjoyed a sample of a different Oleo soap in the same base. The canard base is rather thirsty with my hard water but the time spent working up the lather is well worth the reward of a slick and cushiony lather and fantastic post shave.\n\nAll in all a fantastic shave for both my head and face.",

This stuff is really fantastic. It's magical how it seems to eliminate irritation on my neck and chin even when I push it agt. I'm really glad I gave it a try. I found it works best when applied to a damp face for easy application. My only criticism of the citrus version is that the scent is extremely light, but that's not a big deal. I'd rather it not clash with any other scents anyway. Really though, this stuff is wonderful.",

I loaded really heavy which I have been doing lately and had an obscene amount of excess lather I had no use for. I even applied more lather than usual and I still had way too much. Maybe it was the unbridled decadence that made this shave so good.",

Really nice shave with the *BB*. The pic has the Triad tree trunk handle installed. First shave with it I would say it is actually smoother than the *Dart*. It is in line with the *Wolfman 0.67 OC* and I would say it may be a bit smoother. Not by much, but this was only one time, so more shaves will determine that. First go with a Paladin brush as well. WOW! This bastard is dense yet soft as a cloud. This is the most dense brush I have ever used.\n\nNo issue with the full-on CSE this morning. Great Tuesday shaves to all.",

Pretentious-sounding title of my SOTD aside, this is my first experience actually using Hallows. Gonna hafta say that it wasn't quite what I expected. I was given a penny sample that I've since passed on and I swear the two don't smell alike. But I mean that in the best possible way! There's something about he way Will's mind and nose wraps itself around a darker and danker smell that I absolutely fuckin love! From FG to Leviathan to Roam to Hallows now, these are honestly some of my all-time favorite scents. With Hallows, I love how it opens with a musty chocolate that soon fades to just an overall swampy dirtiness. If you're on the fence and still haven't pulled the trigger on it, I can't rave enough about it. Fuckin wonderful!",

From the sample I got, the soap is easy to load, builds a good lather and has some great slickness. Residual slickness is present as well. This base can hold up with some that are in my upper tier of soaps but I don't think it can claim an elite spot yet. Lather had some breakdown when used in the shower (similar to soaps that are upper tier - only 1 or 2 soaps I own do not breakdown in the shower) and was not as dense as I like. Completely subjective in the density-feel category but just my personal preference. For a vegan soap, I do not think I have used anything better at this point, if you didn't get a sample of this soap, I highly recommend getting one and trying it for yourself.\n\nHappy Tuesday!",

The AC felt harsher today with Glissant, so I backed off on the ATG passes and so have more like a DFS rather than a BBS.\n\n* Brush: Nostalgic odyssey! My first good badger (Parker and Whipped Dog being first badgers ever, but of much different quality.) The smallish Colonel has been performing flawlessly for more than four years - never lost a hair, not an iota of animal funk when new, loads and distributes lather efficiently and reliably. The Best three band hair was maybe a tad pokey at first, but has softened and mellowed out over time, and face feel is now pleasant, while the Colonel has enough backbone for most tastes. Perhaps most impressively, none of the printed text on the handle has faded even slightly over time - I have a Kent that cost thrice as much where the logo is now barely visible after a shorter period of lighter use. All in all, this little guy could still credibly be a shaver's one and only badger, and at a still very reasonable price point.",

I find the old type to be a very comfortable shave for me. Slightly more aggressive than I usually do but I quite enjoyed that aspect.\n\nThis was my second ever shave with a Voskhod. The first shave was slightly rough and I was unsure of it. But then I read that first shave removes some of the teflon coating and it's a better shave the next time (Don't know if that's true or not). This second shave turned out to be one of the easiest and most relaxing shaves I've ever had. Sliced through my stubble like butter and had zero irritation in the two small areas I usually get under my chin. I really like these blades and am anxious to try the other blade samples I purchased.",

I went in knowing that I needed more water than I would normally use, but it still kept getting better the more and more I added. Very very slick, it was thick on the first pass and a little thinner on the next couple, but comfortable overall. I had a much better time with the new to me blade, but still ended up with a few nicks around my mouth, but closed quickly with a little styptic. I do very much like the green and slightly citrus flavor of this soap, I look forward to trying it more maybe in the depths of winter to lift my spirits.",

It's definitely dark and swampy like the description. Initially i get the pepper & chocolate smells, then something dark and slightly sweet. I don't know what vetiver smells like so I can't pinpoint the smell in hallows. All I know is that Will's description is pretty spot on for this scent. Overall, Hallows was a nice surprise of a scent and I can't wait for the days to get cooler where I live. Have a nice Tuesday everyone!",

Quality of shave was about the same in some spots and worse in others compared to using the straight. Comfort was much higher with the DE however. I expect that to improve with the straight as I go forward.\n\nDarkfall, first time using. Man as soon as I opened that jar I though damn, should not have bought sight unseen. However that is how I felt about Leviathan at first as well. After lathering the scent is much more mild and enjoyable. Performance was fantastic and easy to lather.\n",

This custom hybrid brush from dogwoodhandcrafts came in recently - freshly knotted with B6 from declarationgrooming - my first \"dogclaration\"\n\nIt has instantly become my favorite brush.\n\nToday was my first run with it, and not only does the handle look gorgeous, it's very ergonomic in the hand, a characteristic that sometimes gets under appreciated. I thought the B5 of Declaration knots was the best I had ever tried, but something about the backbone + softness is the tips on B6 just clicks for me. This is the first brush I've had that feels like it has backbone but not so much as to be uncomfortable.\n\nThis was an amazing shave with the old Barrister + Mann base. One I haven't used before which used to come in the white tubs. Wow, not really sure why Will had to make any other bases 🤔\n\nLather: Barrister + Mann Bay Rum (old tallow base - more coming on this)\n\nBrush: Dogclaration B6 Custom Hybrid\n\nRazor: Rockwell 6s R4\n\nBlade: Nacet\n\nPost: Bay Rum Splash",

And my Williams puck is getting pretty slim!\n\n## Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Blackland Dart with Gillette - Nacet ‹60 uses›)*\n\nI haven't shaved with the Dart in a month, since I used it all August. But it didn't skip a beat, being a great tool to wield this aged blade. What a solid razor with wonderful blade control.\n\nEven with the thin lather that I managed to work up, I walked away with no irritation, even after 3.5 passes and an alky splash.\n\n## Soap Notes\n*^(Williams)*\n\nThis time, my puck was smaller (since it doesn't have too many uses left), and moved around a lot in the bottom of the cup. I think I should have loaded longer to compensate for that. I might even try pulling the puck out and loading in my palm. Looks about the right size for that.\n\nI used a mod of the \"Easiest bowl way to creamy\" method below and got a slick lather that, while I over-watered it just a hair, still protected well and gave good glide.\n\nMy usual Williams technique:\n(I'm not going to both documenting today's since it was pretty much a technical difficulty)\n\n1. Soak puck in hot water for 5-10 mins\n2. Dip brush fully in water (I just soak mine)\n3. Shake/jostle brush about 2 times to reduce water.\n4. Load brush: 20 secs\n5. Work up in bowl to an elastic, slick lather!\n\n(This is good for my brush. A larger brush that holds more water would need adjustment, etc.)\n\nScent strength - Day 1-2: 3-4/10; Day 4-5: 2-3/10; Day 6-7: 2/10; Day 8-~: 1/10\n\nBest Lathers So Far:\n\n* Maybe best cut ... *Soak*: 7mins (hot); *Shake brush*: 0, but hold until drained; *Load*: 30 sec; *Addt'nl water in bowl*: 0. With this one, lather is a little thinner than what might be called creamy, but the cut result on my trouble spot was nigh perfect.\n* Easiest bowl way to creamy ... *Soak*: 7mins (hot); *Shake brush*: 3 medium-light ones; *Load*: 30 sec; *Addt'nl water in bowl*: 0.\n* The long way ... Bloomed soap (cool water) for 26 mins (that long probably not necessary), 30 sec load with barely damp brush, then ended up adding to a total of 2 tsp water. Looked more like other soaps this time as it became more elastic and hydrated. Had a little cushion, bubbles were very minimal, and was well-slick.\n* Best Face Lather ... No soap soak; Load: 60 secs; Brush Shakes: 5 med-light. First pass could have been thicker but rest were great.\n\n\n## Brush Notes\n*^(Declaration - B5 Rubr)*\n\nLather was kinda thin, but this brush didn't do it any favors, with all its density and stiffness. Tips still wonderfully soft, though.\n\n## Shave Quality\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Few hairs are showing some tip length (with most being cut flush)\n\n----\n\n# Ending of Blades Ledger\n\nUse this to document how long our blades last, if you want, and what about them made us pitch 'em. I created a Google Form with just a few questions:\n\n[Ending of Blades Ledger](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform)\n\n[The Ledger Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing) in case you want to just look at the data.\n\nI'll keep this as my footer each SOTD so you have the link. I'll take it down if no one shows interest.",

The slickness was great, but it really burned my face. The scent wasn't what I was expecting at all as well. Not the fault of the artisan, just not my preference. (insert shameless plug for my shave bazaar post for this soap here.) I really want to find that perfect fall scent of camp fire, leather, and maybe some musk. Looking at hallows, but can't spend the money right. now. I'm really in a conundrum currently.",

Several razors later, I am coming from a WRH7, which is a great size, and the Maze didn't feel too small. I think I'd like if they made a Maze XL, 3.5 instead of 3\", and sized proportionately.

I used Storybook's Coffee Spoons on my head. This was my first time using a Storybook soap and the lather was great with plenty of cushion and slickness. The soap itself was soft which helped me whip up that great lather in no time. The scent is reminiscent of any local convenience stores brewed coffee and that's absolutely fine. I enjoyed it and will rotate the sample until It's gone.\n\nWest Coast Shaving's Cologne was a treat to use. There's not much else to say about Óleo's Canard base so I'll just touch on the scent. The description of a dark mossy floral scent is spot on although it did not smell overly dark to me. I'm not great at describing the scent notes bit I get a top note of floral with the moss underneath. The scent is blended well and is a great overall scent.",

I received a sample of the V2 soap base yesterday and it is quite terrific. I'm always impressed by how natural and fresh SW scents are, and this sample is no exception. I'm not someone who would buy a lavender soap normally, but this sample has me reconsidering that.\n\nThe sample that I received has a soft, almost fluffy texture. It's quite easy to lather. I would say that it's not particularly thirsty, but it does possess a decent range of water tolerance. The soap provides good slickness, excellent lather stability, and very high efficiency (especially compared to some of the more popular tallow-based soaps).\n\nIt feels like the high efficiency may come as a bit of a trade off with slightly less cushion. Since I shave with mild razors, this is not really an issue for me. That being said, the V2 base is no slouch in terms of cushion, and compares favorably to many other tallow-based soaps.\n\nOne thing that struck me when shaving with this is that the soap reminds me a lot of the lather produced by Castle Forbes creams (which is pretty damn good IMHO). The soap is very user friendly, and the post shave feel is great. If you're looking for a smooth, efficient shave, then this may well be your new favorite soap base.",

      "body": "*Razor*: Fatip **Grande (v1)**\n*Blade*: **Gillette - Nacet** (61)\n*Lather*: **Williams Mug Soap**\n*Brush*: **Frank Shaving - Silvertip 22mm Purple Handle**\n*Post*: Stirling - Executive Man Balm\n\n----\n\n[Video](https://youtu.be/J7U-ST__Swo)\n\n## Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Fatip Grande (v1) with Gillette - Nacet ‹61 uses›)*\n\nThis early version of the Grande did so well. Perfectly suited to give me a great shave with the Ole Nacet.\n\nSmooth shave feel and no irritation.\n\n## Soap Notes\n*^(Williams)*\n\nToday as well, was a bit of trouble with my tiny little Williams sliver. Probably should have loaded for longer. But this is a brush that can hold a ton of water, so it may take some time to figure out how much to shake out. And some extra load time, due to small puck size.\n\nMy usual Williams technique:\n(I'm not going to both documenting today's since it was pretty much a technical difficulty)\n\n1. Soak puck in hot water for 5-10 mins\n2. Dip brush fully in water (I just soak mine)\n3. Shake/jostle brush about 2 times to reduce water.\n4. Load brush: 20 secs\n5. Work up in bowl to an elastic, slick lather!\n\n(This is good for my brush. A larger brush that holds more water would need adjustment, etc.)\n\nScent strength - Day 1-2: 3-4/10; Day 4-5: 2-3/10; Day 6-7: 2/10; Day 8-~: 1/10\n\nBest Lathers So Far:\n\n* Maybe best cut ... *Soak*: 7mins (hot); *Shake brush*: 0, but hold until drained; *Load*: 30 sec; *Addt'nl water in bowl*: 0. With this one, lather is a little thinner than what might be called creamy, but the cut result on my trouble spot was nigh perfect.\n* Easiest bowl way to creamy ... *Soak*: 7mins (hot); *Shake brush*: 3 medium-light ones; *Load*: 30 sec; *Addt'nl water in bowl*: 0.\n* The long way ... Bloomed soap (cool water) for 26 mins (that long probably not necessary), 30 sec load with barely damp brush, then ended up adding to a total of 2 tsp water. Looked more like other soaps this time as it became more elastic and hydrated. Had a little cushion, bubbles were very minimal, and was well-slick.\n* Best Face Lather ... No soap soak; Load: 60 secs; Brush Shakes: 5 med-light. First pass could have been thicker but rest were great.\n\n\n## Brush Notes\n*^(FS - Silvertip 22)*\n\nBrush did great right out of the gate! No prickliness. Fairly low on backbone, but that gave me a light, ultra-comfortable shave!\n\n## Shave Quality\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Smooth\n*Neck*: Smooth\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Few hairs are showing some tip length (with most being cut flush)\n\n----\n\n# Ending of Blades Ledger\n\nUse this to document how long our blades last, if you want, and what about them made us pitch 'em. I created a Google Form with just a few questions:\n\n[Ending of Blades Ledger](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform)\n\n[The Ledger Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing) in case you want to just look at the data.\n\nI'll keep this as my footer each SOTD so you have the link. I'll take it down if no one shows interest.",

I tired the PdP No.63 first and liked the scent, so I never got around to using the original scent. Now that I have used it a few times, I think i'm Starting to like this better than No.63. It smells...fresh in a green kind of way. And it is still one of the best bang for the buck soaps available. It is currently well under $15 on Amazon.\n\nThis brush right here could very easily be my one and only. It is my favorite boar and has been almost from the day I bought it. It broke in much easier than most of my Semogues and has been doing great ever since. And I know firsthand that it is also the favorite boar brush of a particular vendor.",

I bowl lather, do samples are never a big deal for me. I noticed how much softer this new base is compared to the old base as soon as I stuck my finger in it. Very very thirsty soap and as I started adding water it EXPLODED! I literally couldn't drown the stuff and eventually stopped trying when I ended up with a bowl slap damn full of yogurty lather. This base is wonderful stuff. I thought the previous base was great but this blows it outta the water for me. The only problem I had was the lighter scent. One of the reasons I love SW so much is that the scent is normally pretty loud. As a former smoker, my sense of smell isn't quite what some other people's is, so I definitely appreciate when I have the opportunity to really get a nose full of something. I didn't have the matching aftershave, so I raided my wife's Latha Lavanda and then topped it all off with A City On Fire because of that affinity for stouter smells.",

It was a great razor to use and one I believe I will be adding to my collection as a daily driver. The barrbarr performance was amazing as usual, this time I got a really good lather out of it, not the usual thin lather. Really happy with that result. Fragrance to round it all out is LP, a great scent that will be soon available to us all. I know I am very excited to get my hands on the soap and aftershave.\n\nHappy Hump Day!",

I did put a new *Polsilver* in it, so it's not a exact comparison, but I can tell the SB is smoother because of the SB vs. the OC. Awesome shave. Quite a few name the *Blackbird* as their favorite razor. Would I say that after one shave? No. Not that it ranks right up there, but the BBS-1 has ruined it for everyone else. Would I take the *Blackbird* over the *Wolfman OC*? Probably. It's that good.\nAlso a first with the Varlet *Ranger*. I was shocked at how small this brush is. It's a fantastic brush, however. It is not a densely packed brush, but the quality of hair in it is off-the charts. I would say it compares to Thäter hair. Not too dense and very high quality. This brush is a fan shape which I like over the bulb of my Thäter.\nGreat Wednesday shaves to all.",

      "body": "**Oct. 3, 2018 - A very Barrister shave**\n\n**Brush:** Barrister and Mann 22mm Synthetic\n**Razor:** Karve (A)\n**Blade:** Polsilver SI\n**Lather:** [Barrister & Mann - Latha Oceana - Soap](https://trythatsoap.com/collection/16/?product_type=soap)\n**Post Shave:** [Barrister & Mann - Latha Oceana - Aftershave (Alcohol Free)](https://trythatsoap.com/collection/16/?product_type=aftershave_noalc)\n\nGreat shave last night. I absolutely love Oceana and also absolutely love the Latha line. Its a bummer it's discontinued because honestly it's some of my favorite looking and performing soaps and aftershaves. Idk why but the simple clean packaging just gets me going. This stuff was the perfect price to performance ratio. Sure it's no reserve or Icarus, but it's plenty slick and the post shave is nothing to be mad at either. Dials in super easy and produced a thick and slick lather without much effort. Combine it with the aftershave and my face is left feeling soft and smooth.\n\nDon't get me started on this scent either. My all time favorite scent aside from Seville, and it's a tough choice between the two as for what I would use if I had to pick one. It's just so fresh and clean smelling. It burns me a little but it's well worth it. I was lucky enough to have Will make me an Oceana edt and it's for sure my most worn fragrance. I'd love for it to become a regular scent in his line up. It works very well as a scent during the warm months, but idgaf I wear it any time. Wednesday, let's get over this hump and then we are almost to the weekend! Hope everyone's day goes by quickly.",

The brush still competes well today, offering a nice bloom, soft face feel, and very respectable firmness. For a smallish brush, lather distribution is still on the inefficient side, and my other Shavemac fell apart over time, so not a favorite, but still a nice design.\n\n* Frag: An attempt to create a fougere without using any of the traditional fougere ingredients, LAP's Absinthe is an interesting and unique fragrance being spicey, smokey, and woody and lacking any hint of florals. Lots of wormwood though, tempered with anise, but that note may be a deal breaker for many. Certainly Yatagan fans should check this one out! Concentration rating is a tad misleading, as despite EDP claim, longevity and intensity is more on the EDT side (which is perfectly acceptable, of course).",

It was very squishy this morning. I'm gonna need the folks over at Southern Witchcrafts to get the bath bars up for sale ASAP because I fear my tester is not long for this world.\n\nTryThatSoap thought I should be using Ghost Town Barber today... and I considered it, but I already had my heart set on Flying Hide. I absolutely love the scent and the lather was almost slick enough to protect me from overdoing it on my first shave with my birthday razor. I went a little too rough on my jawline and one spot on my neck. I guess I need some time to get used to the longer handle and different balance. I'm not quite ready to declare it a \"display piece\" just yet (partly because I don't want to be someone who hangs on to gear I don't like using). But it's not going to get a shot tomorrow, because I'm planning to drag the loaner Wolfie through the 4 days of growth that will be on my dome.\n\nVery few meetings today, but I do have to write up two job openings that I've got on my team. Also, I need to continue planning the London trip for the end of the month.",

Flying Hide happened to be one of them. This was my first use of Noble Otter V2 and it was very good. The scent was also quite enjoyable. I'm not sure if it's my favorite of the lot that I got but we'll see once I get to use them all. Also, I had a sample of Stag soap a long time ago and don't remember really liking it, but got the AS sample now and wow, I'm loving it. I'm definitely picking up a bottle of this when the sample runs out.\n\n​",

Black Fern\n\nToday's shave was a little smoother than yesterday. I'm pointing the finger at rotating a blade through different razors. It seems whenever I do this, the first couple of shaves aren't as smooth as if I put a new blade in. My logic being the blade gets set in a certain geometry of said razor, and when you move it to another razor, it isn't at the same angle, upsetting the smoothness. I dunno, just a thought. Anyone else experience this?\n\nHump day shave, hell yeah!!!!",

I'd hang onto one of those for months, no matter how nasty it was between the blades, because god knows you can't get the paste consisting of the highly touted shaving-goop-that-turns-to-cream with stubble out of there. I did whatever I could to save money there, like never shaving on consecutive days or downgrading to the 3-blade cartridges. I had no problem with the 3-blade cartridge, and if I recall, it was at least a buck cheaper per cartridge than the 4 or 5 blade. Naturally, at that point I would browse the aisles to see if I could find two-blade cartridges (that weren't Bic disposable shavers, simply because of how much plastic and metal I'd be throwing away), just to see how few blades I could get by on. This went on for some time before my wife actually put the idea of this type of shaving in my head, but I wrote it off because I only knew of the stores like AoS where I didn't want to get ripped off. It was around the time that DSC and Harry's were competing for market share, and I had gone far enough to see if one of these plans were feasible. It wasn't until I stumbled across w_e and eventually, this sub, that I really knew I wanted to get into it. Who knows, without communities like these, I may not have kept at it for as long as I have now.\n\nEnd scene.",

SURPRISE! My dad found it in his closet somewhere new in box and handed it off. I broke it in and tried it out. It's a really short hair so it doesn't hold lather well and bristles are falling out all over the place. It wasn't marked so I didn't know what it was, but the Barrister and Mann account on IG actually called it out and let me know, so thanks to them!\n\nI do like Black Ship Classic though. I might have to look into them some more.\n\nGoal of the day: get my flu shot\n\nHave a good one!",

If I had to describe it in a word...I would say \"balanced.\" There isn't really anything to find fault with. It does everything well, but it's not overly focused in any one area at the expense of another. The soap is medium soft, lathers extremely well, has a very wide tolerance for water, is slick with great glide and cushion, makes a stable lather, and provides a great post shave feel. Sure there might be a handful of other soaps that are better in one or two of these areas, but I would say that this pretty much always means the soap isn't quite as good in another area.\n\nThe scent on the soap is fairly mild, and comes across as a complex blend of lavender, cedar, sandalwood, and musk. There are a few other notes, but these are the major players that stand out to me when I smell the tub. I can totally see where the creators at APR were coming from. The scent is definitely reminds me of places that I've been in Texas and Australia. The scent strengthens a bit when the soap is lathered, but not a lot. The aftershave matches the soap, but adds just a bit more volume to some of the other notes in the scent (especially the top citrus notes). My only (tiny) regret with this soap is that it's more of a summery scent. It would have been nice if this special release had dropped back in May or June rather than right before the start of cool weather.",

Makes a great travel brush and (before innumerable budget Plissonitators) used to be the best value in cheap synths. A bit springy, but still splayable, and as mentioned, does not really look like it's 23mm.\n\n* Frag: Was going to go with Encre Noire, also in honor of Mr. Putin, as it is the closest thing I have to a weaponized neurotoxin. But a tad warm today, so went with the (somewhat) more moderate Amouage Gold. Tons of powder and floral there, with some incense and amber, so this too might strike some as a toxic assault. But it is an elegant well made scent, with obviously costly materials in the brief, so Vladimir and I are of the same mind on it.",

I love lavender and had a scent of DG/CL Pure Lavender but the aftershave scent would last only minutes on me so I was disappointed and after seeing the high praise this scent always gets, I had to try it. The scent is amazing, I don't even know how else to describe it. This soap was much softer than my other Reserve soaps, it almost looked and felt like an entirely different base and loaded so much easier than my others do.

I figured for an October Surprise, it would be fun to reach down into my \"never reach for this stuff\" drawer and pull out the TOBS (since I'm planning to stop by the Jermyn Street shop in a few weeks). The only splash I've got to match with it is the dwindling sample of Captain's Choice Sandalwood. I topped the whole thing off with a surprise fragrance that arrived yesterday in my semi-regular Birchbox delivery.

The soap came together easily and beautifully, I had tons of lather left over after three passes. The splash felt great and I don't usually wear fragrances, but I do like it so I might start branching out a bit more. I still don't really like these blades, I seem to get more knicks but I don't know if I can put it down to that or just lack of attention/rushing.",

First try of Lonestar (luv'd it).\n\n## Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Rockwell 6S with Gillette - Nacet ‹62 uses›)*\n\nI used Rockwell with the 4 baseplate.\n\nThe shave was a little rough. Rougher than when I have younger blades, for sure, since I used to use plate 4 on a regular basis. So I might be interested in bringing it down to a 3 for this blade. Passes 2-3 were just fine, though. I chose 4 specifically because this old blade seems to like more aggressive heads. But it didn't work out this time.\n\nIt may have felt a little rough on the first pass, but I ended up with a good, close shave and no irritation that lasted past the shave.\n\n## Soap Notes\n*^(NO - Lonestar)*\n\nLonestar has a great scent! Manly and well-mixed with good notes. I could easily see wearing this as an EDT (if my wife liked anything other than Aqua Di Gio! and GIT).\n\nI don't know if this is the new base or not, but it performed well.\n\n1/4- tsp of soap + 2.5 tsp water made a great lather, and just the right amount for 3.5 passes, using my Romero Manchurian brush.\n\n\n## Brush Notes\n*^(Romero - Manchurian 26mm)*\n\nThis is probably my favorite brush. Just the right density, medium backbone, and splay for me... and super soft tips!!\n\n## Shave Quality\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: A little irritating\n*Neck*: A little irritating\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Few hairs are showing some tip length (with most being cut flush)\n\n----\n\n# Ending of Blades Ledger\n\nUse this to document how long our blades last, if you want, and what about them made us pitch 'em. I created a Google Form with just a few questions:\n\n[Ending of Blades Ledger](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform)\n\n[The Ledger Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing) in case you want to just look at the data.\n\nI'll keep this as my footer each SOTD so you have the link. I'll take it down if no one shows interest.",

Chose a couple of the first items I acquired when delving into wetshaving and it was still super comfortable and relaxing. Having a good soap and AS scent to enjoy is nice but even using items with little to no scent is still relaxing to me.",

You know how it goes for the last of a sample, a bit thin and a lot of swirling to get every last bit. It was a nice week though, and the sample lasted 5 shaves. I wish it had more staying power, both for the soap and AS. I can barely smell myself and it's only been 15 minutes. My AS samples look like I barely touched them, so they'll probably last 15-20 shaves.\n\nIt's Friday. Don't break anything.",

This is my \"Iron Maiden\" voyage of anything from Noble Otter. It is an easy soap to load and get to a rich, creamy lather that can take water and provides all the attributes you want in a quality soap. The scent from APR is a smooth blend of a multitude of notes. Someone described it in yesterday's SOTD as non-offensive. That is a good description. I can pick out some of the citrus, sandalwood, musk, oakmoss, and vanilla. I know some words aren't a scent description, but \"smooth\" and \"comforting\" come to my mind. The aftershave is really nice. Of course you get a truer scent from the aftershave compared to the soap. Well done to both Noble Otter and APR! Great FRIDAY!! shaves to all. **GO TRIBE!**",

I messed up guys. Pretty badly. I was taking my razor apart to dry it, like I do every mornin, when I dropped the blade. I've been taught multiple times since I was a Boy Scout that a falling knife has no handle and you'd think I'd remember that with something like a DE blade that doesn't have one at all anyway, but not so! I instinctively grabbed the blade and now my left thumb is bleeding pretty profusely lol. Thankfully, I work at a clinic and will probably just glue myself up instead of tryin to get stitched.

The scent is fantastic. Deep musky base notes that just open up into this beautiful spicy/sweet cinnamon and tobacco blend. Absolutely superb scent but not something I probably should be wearing at the office. I would say this is an intimate scent, something you would wear with a beautiful suit, for a wedding or an anniversary. A very special occasion scent.\n",

Love the scent on this one too. Loaded this broosh up real quick added a little water and *voila* -dialed in. Doesn't get much easier. This might sound strange but the performance on this kind of reminds me of Fine soaps. Lathers up really easy and is plenty slick. I'd say latha produces a little bit denser of a lather and has better post shave, so definite improvement there.\n\nB6 still proves to be super soft and such a good batch. Does it get much better?? Get in while you can folks!\n\nFucking hell, finally Friday. Yesterday sucked so bad work was nuts! Pun intended (if you know, you know). Looking forward to get through today and get the fuck outta there. Hope everyone has a good Friday and great weekend!",

I am weird about lavender. I love lavender scented things in the world but have not found a lavender scented shave soap that has really done it for me. I've tried the BM Reserve, Razorock Essential Oil Lavender and a few other ones and just didn't love them. This is much more what I was looking for and I'm not entirely sure the difference. It is very mellow and just has a pleasant scent. The CL aftershave salve is a little too harsh with the lavender scent but fades fairly quickly, so I'm good with that. I really hate this brush. This is the first time using it and it just not have any splay at all. I switched to bowl lathering since I was struggling to get anything going on my face and it fared much better with that. It would probably be a great brush for bowl latherers but I prefer face lathering in general. So I'll weigh in more on the overall performance after I try this again tomorrow with one of my regular brushes, but despite the struggle with the brush, the lather was very slick and felt great on my skin. So I think I'm going to like this. Good job, Southern Witchcraft, on the new base and on nailing the lavender scent. And the new labels look fantastic.",

Made for a great shave - would be hard for me to pick the General or the Calypso as better. Blade is holding up well - aiming for another 4 shaves on it to \"get my money's worth\".\n\n* Soap: I fell away from using Mike's because of the dull scents (mostly 1-2 notes and / or pre-blends), but the performance today was an eye-opener - really good stuff, close to Reserve in quality, definitely a cut above Catie's for me. The scent was, well, simple but pleasant enough.\n\n",

I suppose UJG is very nearly unscented and I could have used any splash I wanted, but I just don't know if I have anything gray enough.

Got it in one of those empty jars that you get from Maggards. Probably not a good idea that I bought that because now I want some more. Got a lot of chocolate scent out of it, and not much tobacco, but it was an awesome scent with great performance. I'm going to go against what many say and say that (at least for this soap) the performance beat B&M. While B&M has a better slickness and smoother shave, I feel there are more face food qualities in this WK as I felt it throughout the day.\n\nHave a great day everyone!",

And Icarus, well... you know.\n\n## Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Rockwell 6S with Gillette - Nacet ‹63 uses›)*\n\nSo the shave with the 4 plate was rough yesterday. However, I threw in the 3 today and it was the utter opposite. Nice and smooth, and I got a great cut. The 3 is a plate that I often choose when I'm not in \"marathon\" mode, using younger blades.\n\nNo irritation at all. Will this blade ever die?\n\n## Soap Notes\n*^(DG - Dirtyver)*\n\n1/4- tsp of soap + 3.3 tsp of water was just the right amount for me and my 4 passes of lather. And it was dialed in very well, for my prefs, at least: bit of cushion to give a luxury feel, but super slick and protective.\n\nScent strength: 4-5 out of 10. I enjoyed it greatly during the shave.\n\nScent: Wow. So good. Timeless, earthy (in a clean way). The vetiver and the earth fit together so well. Understated. Confident.\n\n\n## Brush Notes\n*^(DrivenLegend - Chubby)*\n\nThis was a 30mm synth Tuxedo type knot. Much too backboney for me. I guess guys just apply the lather with the tips on this kind. But I like to splay. I might yank this knot out and go with maybe a Finest or so.\n\nBut the handle is beautiful and I think I enjoyed the chubby-ness of it, even though I'm a bowl latherer.\n\n## Shave Quality\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Smooth\n*Neck*: Smooth\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Few hairs are showing some tip length (with most being cut flush)\n\n----\n\n# Ending of Blades Ledger\n\nUse this to document how long our blades last, if you want, and what about them made us pitch 'em. I created a Google Form with just a few questions:\n\n[Ending of Blades Ledger](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform)\n\n[The Ledger Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing) in case you want to just look at the data.\n\nI'll keep this as my footer each SOTD so you have the link. I'll take it down if no one shows interest.",

I remember about 3 years ago, people were talking about this scent. I think it came in the white label.\n\n\n\n\nI remember I wanted to try it so bad. I imagined it smelling similar to an apple pie. I love pie. Unfortunately by the time I joined the reddit wet shaving family, all the white labels were discontinued. Nocturne, Solarion, Caledonia Rose, etc.\n\n\n\nIm so glad that it came back. This smell is the embodyment if fall. I live in orange county, this whole neighborhood used to be orange fields, I have no idea what an apple orchard smells like. But you know what? With this scent, I can picture the falling leaves, the damp earth, and a hot cup of apple cider on a brisk fall morning. Beautiful.\n\n\n\n\nThe razor was much better this time around. I still got a few weepers but I felt that it was much smoother. I mean, it's a smooth feeling razor. I just haven't quite got a handle on that angle just yet. Few more shaves and I think I should be good. I really want to like this razor.",

Wow, that went fast! Ten years already? Wow. Settle in and listen to the calamity that is my ten year anniversary gift giving attempt:\n\n>The traditional ten year gift is tin/aluminum. I sought out an artist that will take a sound recording of a voice, heartbeat, song, etc, and turn the sound into a wave form and then print it on a media (paper, canvas, wood, etc) along with an inscription.\n\n>So I sent the artist a clip of the song that Wife and I danced to at our wedding, and had it printed on a big sheet of brushed aluminum. It turned out to be a beautiful piece of *big* wall art, complete with a smaller framed QR code to hang next to it, so anyone can scan the code and hear the sound that made the wave.\n\n>I was pretty proud of my gift for Wife. And I was sure she would love it. Unique, personalized, beautiful. Home run, right? Eh...\n\n>I was right. She loved it. She loved the idea so much, she had already gotten me **the exact same thing**.\n\n>[We're so cute...](https://m5.paperblog.com/i/118/1184527/top-ten-tuesday-characters-id-like-to-check-i-L-V7uabn.gif)\n\n>We bought each other the exact same gift, without talking about it, totally independent of one another. Well, it's a good story I guess.\n\nThe rest of today is a nice full day of lunch, massage, dinner reservations, and and a few surprise plans Wife has sprinkled in, and a nice hotel downtown for tonight. Should make for a nice relaxing anniversary.",

I used a mid-setting (4) on my Fat Boy to knock down the day-and-a-half's worth of growth on the first pass. I started with a 5, but it was too rough. Usually I'll keep the setting the same as the first pass or dial it down from there. But with this aging-but-smooth blade, I got an amazing shave by bumping it UP from there (all the way to a 7) for all subsequent passes!\n\n## Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Gillette - Fat Boy with Gillette - Nacet ‹64 uses›)*\n\nGot about as good a shave result as I can get, with no irritation or discomfort. Used setting 4 to knock down the hairs with first pass. Then up to 7 till I was done.\n\nProbably the best shave I've had with this blade, within the last month, with any razor, including Karve, Wolfman, Dart, Fatip, and Rockwell. And that's measured across both spectrums of comfort and efficiency.\n\n## Soap Notes\n*^(N.O. - Texaus)*\n\nTexaus has a great scent! Manly and well-mixed with good notes: woody but mostly musky/cologny. I could easily see wearing this as an EDT.\n\nThis is the new base from N.O.\n\n1/4- tsp of soap + 3 tsp water made the perfect lather for me (luxury feeling, but super slick), and just the right amount for 3.5 passes, using my Declaration Grooming B5.\n\n\n## Brush Notes\n*^(Declaration - B5 Rubr)*\n\nAt this point, this brush seems to kill thinner lathers pretty well. I think it's just because it's new-ish. But maybe it's just so dense that there's less room for the lather. Since soap is more sticky and concentrated than lather, I wonder if these super-dense brushes lend themselves more towards face-lathering.\n\nBut this lather wasn't thin, by any means. But I did have to go back a couple of times for more suds, especially during the first pass.\n\n## Shave Quality\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Smooth\n*Neck*: Smooth\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Cut flush to where I just see the tips (above average for me)\n\n----\n\n# Ending of Blades Ledger\n\nUse this to document how long our blades last, if you want, and what about them made us pitch 'em. I created a Google Form with just a few questions:\n\n[Ending of Blades Ledger](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform)\n\n[The Ledger Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing) in case you want to just look at the data.\n\nI'll keep this as my footer each SOTD so you have the link. I'll take it down if no one shows interest.",

Great head shave this morning. I love the scent on this soap and the performance of the Declaration bison tallow base really is special. There's a pretty good chance I'm just going to wind up smelling like leather all winter.\n\nAlso, I've got a bit of a conundrum... When you've got a scent you really enjoy - let's call it \"Sharkfall\" - and you have it in two top-notch bases - let's call them \"tyson mallow\" and \"flickerus\" - how do you decide which one to use? Do you use up the older one first? Do you alternate back and forth? Do you go straight for the \"flickerus\", saving the \"dison mallow\" because they ain't making any more of that and that makes it almost like a limited edition?\n\nGotta start getting the guest bedroom in order this weekend. Mother-in-law is coming to watch the kids while the wife and I are in London in a few weeks and the guest room is a complete wreck. The biggest project is going to be assembling the Murphy bed, which we've been avoiding doing for nearly 2 months now. Maybe after the pumpkin patch...",

Was curious to see how it held up after sampling a lot of artisan soaps in Sep. I still think this one punches above its weight, price-wise (I got it for about $5 on Amazon), and is a good travel solution. I got quite a bit of lather even though it didn't seem like a lot of the soap was getting on my face when applying it. The Stirling synthetic is not usually one of my favorites but was well-suited to this sort of face lathering--splays easily and holds plenty of water.",

It's a great vetivery and musky scent. It opens with some nice vetiver and cardamom and has a great musky, smoky finish. It paired very well with La Quatrieme Ville, which was a combination I've been waiting to try for a while, but it also goes well with Dirtyver and I think it would be fun to pair with Y/R/P, Darkfall, Leviathan, and any other dark and musky you could think of. Anyways, get yourself a sample! It's become one of my favourite scents",

It's a cologne-type scent (at least to my nose) that reminds me a lot of Mickey Lee Soapworks Pantie Dropper, which I'm also a big fan of. My sample was much softer than my other Reserve samples or full size tubs. It's damn near cream soft, but it still whipped up into an awesome Reserve lather like the rest. I'll likely be picking up a tub when it's released next month. Cheers.",

I've been sticking to the Sharp Edge since they were so good when trying out blades for the new razor, I thought I should at least finish trying all the blades though. The Super Stainless is a rougher shave with no irritation, it's also not as close as the Sharp Edges. After this blade I'll stick to the Sharp Edge.\n\nThe Declaration sample is still going strong, maybe 1 or 2 more shaves out of it. It's a great base, just not a scent for me really which is a shame.",

High tide at 10:36 tonight.\n\nI told the Small One that she could pick out the whole shave today. This is what she picked, minus the Issey Miyake, I added that because it goes well with The Kraken. It's been awhile since I've used this brush. It's quite a different beast compared to the badgers. Didn't have to load for nearly as long, and smashing into my face to build the lather then painting on the lather doesn't really work. I don't know how people that use synths actually make it through tubs of soap, it takes long enough with a monster badger, let alone something that is super efficient like a synth.\n\nHave a nice Sunday everyone!",

Been using the 5/8 Roc sight unseen as my only experience till now. I really enjoyed using the larger blade. It made for a more comfortable shave and post shave. I was worried it would be difficult to get to tight places like under my nose and angles of my chin and neck. To my surprise It was actually easier. The weight of the blade made all spots easier to shave, it more glided through than me having to apply any pressure at all. The near wedge vs the full hollow also made things smoother. Where I would get some snagging with the full hollow I got non with this. One of the best shaves I've had.\n\nI also find using a straight, either one of them, two passes gives me what 3 passes did with a DE.\n\nHope its raining less by u guys, enjoy your Sunday",

Second shave was noticeably harsher. It's amazing to me how quickly these blades deteriorate for me. I can get multiple shaves with a Perma Sharp with no loss of comfort. Not so here. I'm thinking in the future I'm just going to bin it after one use. I really like the performance of it on the first shave but the second and beyond isn't worth it to me to save a few pennies. I'll probably make this a special occasion blade as I really do get a fantastic shave the first use.",

What an absolutely fantastic shave.\n\nI feel like I say this every time I get a chance to do one of these, but I know it's been awhile. Today was the first day in awhile, though, that I've gotten a chance to properly enjoy my shave. Because I knew I wouldn't be on a time crunch for once, I decided to break out one of my favorite soap/splash/scent combinations of all time - Roam. Some tough memories associated with this one, though, hence an unfortunate months long hiatus on using it. Time to get back to Roam-ing, though! This is the first artisan soap I ever used and it remains one of my favorites. This was my first time using an Astra blade and I absolutely love them. They're smooth, sharp, and efficient, all while being a perfect match for my Black Beauty. I usually have issues finding a blade I like in that particular razor, so finding one that worked so well was a real treat.\n\nAnyway, back off to writing essays and studying! Happy Sunday, all!",

Worked so well again! I think it's this old Nacet that makes it work. Maybe it's all smoothed over or something.\n\nVery comfortable shave... smooth, even.\n\n## Soap Notes\n*^(Williams)*\n\nI thought my sliver of Williams was super thin, so I wanted to try breaking some off and pressing it into the bottom of my lather bowl. it turns out that the puck was much thicker than I thought! A lot of life still there, even after a month and a half of shaves.\n\nSome of the pieces stuck to the bottom, and I think those helped the lather the most. I soaked these pieces, to try to help.\n\nI did end up with a great lather that was super slick and enjoyable.\n\nAnd... I was in such a rush that I forgot the post shave. Williams is supposed to be drying, right? Yes, I do have oily skin, but still.... no drying effect at all.\n\nMy usual Williams technique:\n(I'm not going to both documenting today's since it was pretty much a technical difficulty)\n\n1. Soak puck in hot water for 5-10 mins\n2. Dip brush fully in water (I just soak mine)\n3. Shake/jostle brush about 2 times to reduce water.\n4. Load brush: 20 secs\n5. Work up in bowl to an elastic, slick lather!\n\n(This is good for my brush. A larger brush that holds more water would need adjustment, etc.)\n\nScent strength - Day 1-2: 3-4/10; Day 4-5: 2-3/10; Day 6-7: 2/10; Day 8-~: 1/10\n\nBest Lathers So Far:\n\n* Maybe best cut ... *Soak*: 7mins (hot); *Shake brush*: 0, but hold until drained; *Load*: 30 sec; *Addt'nl water in bowl*: 0. With this one, lather is a little thinner than what might be called creamy, but the cut result on my trouble spot was nigh perfect.\n* Easiest bowl way to creamy ... *Soak*: 7mins (hot); *Shake brush*: 3 medium-light ones; *Load*: 30 sec; *Addt'nl water in bowl*: 0.\n* The long way ... Bloomed soap (cool water) for 26 mins (that long probably not necessary), 30 sec load with barely damp brush, then ended up adding to a total of 2 tsp water. Looked more like other soaps this time as it became more elastic and hydrated. Had a little cushion, bubbles were very minimal, and was well-slick.\n* Best Face Lather ... No soap soak; Load: 60 secs; Brush Shakes: 5 med-light. First pass could have been thicker but rest were great.\n\n\n## Brush Notes\n*^(WD - Boar 24)*\n\nLove this boar\n\n## Shave Quality\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Smooth\n*Neck*: Smooth\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Cut flush to where I just see the tips (above average for me)\n\n----\n\n# Ending of Blades Ledger\n\nUse this to document how long our blades last, if you want, and what about them made us pitch 'em. I created a Google Form with just a few questions:\n\n[Ending of Blades Ledger](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform)\n\n[The Ledger Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing) in case you want to just look at the data.\n\nI'll keep this as my footer each SOTD so you have the link. I'll take it down if no one shows interest.",

Also, the Ch2 is an absolute lather hog (absolute unit?). I didn't much care for the Personna blades in any of my other razors, but I figured I shouldn't send the Wolfie home without trying a few different blades in it. I'll see how it goes with Polsilver and Feather this week if I have the time in the mornings.\n\nUsually, I'm the only one awake before 10 on weekends but for some reason, the 6-year old was up when I got up this morning. And she's committed to following through on the plan she made last night, which involves breakfast followed by a trip to the neighborhood park. So she's fully dressed right now and ready to go out in the 47-degree rain to go to the park while I'm still in my pajamas and have barely touched my first cup of coffee. It's going to be an interesting day.",

Hard to get in the zone when there's a guy 10 feet away in the stall pushin' brown. The confused looks you get when they see the soap, brush and razor are amusing as well. It was a much needed shave though since I hadn't since Thursday morning. It was starting to get all itchy and shit. Face is feeling and smelling great now though. Happy Sunday!",

Great match of blade and razor for my type of skin/beard.\n\nNo irritation.\n\n## Soap Notes\n*^(SV - Felce Aromatica)*\n\n30 secs of loading on a presoaked puck + 3 tsp water = about 2 more passes of lather than I needed.\n\nTry 20 sec of loading next time.\n\nScent strength: 1-2 out of 10\n\nScent is a very nice ferny grassy one, with not much else. I really enjoyed it. Low key and fresh.\n\nPerformance was excellent. A sheeny creamy lather whipped up pretty quickly. Gave me great slickness, and enough cushion to work nicely. Luxury feel as I rinsed between passes.\n\nPairs really well, I think, with Clubman Special Reserve\n\n\n## Brush Notes\n*^(Declaration - B5 Rubr)*\n\nEnjoying this knot. It's not shoving my face around.\n\n## Shave Quality\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Smooth\n*Neck*: Smooth\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Few hairs are showing some tip length (with most being cut flush)\n\n----\n\n# Ending of Blades Ledger\n\nUse this to document how long our blades last, if you want, and what about them made us pitch 'em. I created a Google Form with just a few questions:\n\n[Ending of Blades Ledger](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform)\n\n[The Ledger Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing) in case you want to just look at the data.\n\nI'll keep this as my footer each SOTD so you have the link. I'll take it down if no one shows interest.",

Holy shit does that stuff smell just right! It's a strange combination of berry up front with a weird musky backdrop. I dunno how else to describe it this time. It's unusual, like most other scents from Zoologist. The base is pretty nice too, but the scent on this is the kicker IMO. I didn't have anything that even remotely matched it to my nose, so I went with Brut AS and, as suggested by u/MalthusTheShaver, I picked up a bottle of the Brut EdT and used it. The EdT is a somewhat softer and more refined version of the scent to me. Have a great Monday!",

The soap is great if you're just looking for something cheap that smells fresh. The soap has a nice fatty feeling on the face, with good residual slickness for touch ups. For the price, this soap has to be the best on the market. The aftershave is great as well, It is a little more harsh compared to the more premium aftershaves such as CL or B&M but still has plenty of healing properties.\n",

Great lather, great skin, great scent.\n\n\nRegarding the scent, C&CC leaves me quite irritated, but I love it so much that I use it a few times a month. Like, I *really* love it. I had a bottle and ended up giving it to my brother because of the burn it gave me. Ended up buying another bottle of aftershave, and got the cologne too because I missed it so much. No regrets.\n\n\nRegarding the lather, this soap is amazing. I'm surprised it doesn't turn up here more often.\n\n\nRegarding the song, I love this group, but they're admittedly not for everyone. Good times associated with Xiu Xiu.\n\n\n",

It is supposed to be in the high 80s today. WTF? At least it's baseball weather for the Tribe-Astros game today. Let hope the Indians can find their bats. They must have not shipped them to Houston for some reason (looking at you, Jose Ramirez!)\n\nMy youngest is off school (Columbus Day) as well as tomorrow. Something about mid-Fall break. Is that a thing? <rolls eyes>. Anyhow, what better thing to do but go to C-bus on C-bus Day! Should be fun.\n\nWent with the vintage *Hai Karate* aftershave this morning. Did not use Thayers to realize full effect. Has a nice alcohol bite to it at first, but goes away quickly. The biggest scent I get is \"powdery\" with some citrus in the background. A great scent for a hot day.\n\nBest shave yet with the Blackbird Open Comb. I need to be more careful than with the SB version. Kind of like the difference with the Timeless Titanium vs. the stainless steel version. Fantastic shave was had. And there is something about that Triad \"tree trunk\" handle that just works. Great Monday shaves to all.",

Still smooth and comfy shave.\n\n* Soap: After much back and forth with thinking Glissant to be better than WL or vice versa, I have reached the position that both are roughly equal for me in soft water (my usual). Vertyver Santal is one of the finest discontinued B&M scents, with a top notch real sandalwood cultivar in it (none of the more typical simulated synthetic sandalwoods found in most shaving) and a lovely dose of Haitian vetiver. I hope this one comes back one day, but given that maybe 15 shavers in the US like the scent of vetiver, that hope seems unlikely to be realized.\n\n* Post: Bought this on a whim as it is a new formula, claims to be good for relieving razor irritation (one of the three actions) and also claims to be a moisturizer and light duty (SPF 15) sunscreen. Well, two of three ain't bad. Not a very good post shave, but a decent moisturizer and (I presume) an adequate sunscreen. Neutrogena and I have never really gotten along, and this middling product is apparently not going to be the bridge between us.",

I really need a better catalog because it was only after I was done that it occurred to me that perhaps Silk Pyjamas would've made a nicer shave on a cold morning like today. For the first time ever, I wasn't completely satisfied with Rhino as a scent choice. Am not quite sure what to make of that.\n\n2-Pass shave today and I still got a BBS. I have the Standard Gap, the Timeless Bronze and the Rockwell and combined they very nicely cover the range of Aggressive to mild. No more razors for me.

I ended up going with my wife's Witchy Woman soap from Stirling. It's based on a Victoria's Secret scent but it smells more like Hawaiian Punch to me. A nice fun shave especially with temps in the 80's for the next day or so.\n\nI decided to use some HeadSlick for my head which is lightly mentholated and feels great on the scalp. It actually lathers up quite nice with a brush and I even add a little bit of water to get it how I like. It's plenty slick and does not gunk up the razor with this method. I'd recommend it to any head shavers out there.",

I feel like I'm getting the hang of this razor though, I'm not giving up on it just yet.\n\nThe Fine soap was really good. I put it in a mug, and went to work. It's really slick, and easy to hydrate. It's also cold, but not overly cold. I liked that I could see the menthol crystals crystalizing on top of the soap, it gave it a really cool look.\n\nHave a great day guys!",

It shaves great, but that large safety bar does take some getting used to. I am a big fan of the weight and the razor is in that perfect spot for aggressiveness in a shave. I would have never tried it without that PIF so thanks again!\n\nHave a good one!",

It's surprisingly good. It's very easy to lather, and it's quite slick, protective and fatty. It's by far the best RR soap I've tried. The scent on this is actually quite good too for a floid blue dupe. It's a bit sweeter and less bitter than other versions I've smelled.",

First time ever using this stuff and I for sure see what all the hype is about. Super good smells, I just want to be covered in them, I wanna bathe in it, lay me down in a bed of these ferns. I don't care how expensive it is, I want an aftershave and EdT in this scent so bad. Let's make it happen Sir William Barrister III, we gotta get dem pre orders going brother. Even the performance on this stuff left me impressed. It's been awhile since I've used the old wild label formula but a short quick load on the synth brush it still took quite a bit of water. Eventually I got that nice thick shiny lather and it provided a *very* slick shave. This is still a great base, even the post shave on it left my face soft and adequately hydrated. Overall, color me impressed. Until this returns I will do my best to hoard all the tubs I possibly can.",

The blade feels like it has plenty of life in it, and the General SS is a dream to shave with - minimal blade feel, but immense efficiency, and delivers ATG shaving with rock solid stability.\n\n* Soap: A clever blend of vetiver and cedar that simulates the smell of old books / parchment. (Like the Declaration of Independence, the central document of the eponymous revolution...). As always, after a three pass BBS, my face is a tad achey with CB, but then cold water and the post shave makes all the discomfort go away like magic.\n\n* Is this a good shave? I would say so. Some other soaps are utterly painless for me, but the smells and general Good Dude status of the Catie's brand draws me back repeatedly, and really, what's a few minutes of minor discomfort in the scheme of things?\n\n* Frag: Citrus and florals, quite powerful and very 19th Cent. One of my favorites and very distinctive! Kind of a scent for all seasons too.",

I really struggled getting the lather right. Part of the reason I used Stirling is because I've used it a ton and it is pretty easy to lather, but maybe my head is too dry or something. I feel like I put a gallon of water in without getting the normal level of lather. Anyhow, it was a much closer shave than my first outing over the weekend. This time I actually paid attention to hair direction and got a really smooth shave outside of that weird crown area. And even that was better. The Maggard MR7 with the longer handle seemed to make things a little easier. I'm very pleased. And a little surprised at how fast my hair on my head grows considering I have been bald for my entire adult life.",

I wanted to push my Kai blade to the max and see what I could get out of it. I didn't count, but I think I had at least 10 shaves--if not more--on a single Kai blade.\n\nToday, I did half my face with the old blade and half with a brand new Kai. It was like a night-and-day difference. I love those Kai blades but I really don't think they last longer than 5 shaves max, which is kind of a bummer considering they're one of the pricier options.",

I will say that the first time I used it I completely underloaded it, something I always seem to do with creams. I also managed to let it get lost in the pile. However, this time I made sure to load more heavily, and got much more lather, but still just a slight bit too little quantity to finish a 3 pass, so I went back in to the lather still in my sample bowl and got more than enough. I got a great shave from it, no complaints!!!\n\nDFS after a few days. I thought I'd take Sunday off, and I just didn't have time yesterday until evening, so I decided just to hold off until this morning. It was glorious!!!!\n\nHave a great day everyone!",

Working with a tiny remnant of Williams, for this quick shave.\n\n## Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Gillette - NEW de Luxe 17mm with Gillette - Nacet ‹67 uses›)*\n\nLove the NEW de Luxes! Smoother than the standard NEW for me, and this 3 piece looks so classic.\n\nBlade shaved well and shows no sign of stopping any time soon.\n\n## Soap Notes\n*^(Williams)*\n\nI'm trying to wear this Williams soap puck out, but it's putting up some resistance. The puck is getting small, and i decided to load from my palm today, so that I could get more movement on it, than when it pings around inside the mug.\n\nBut I think a 30 sec load was not enough, even though the puck had been soaked in hot for a few mins. So I'll try for longer some other time, due to small puck size. When I'm dealing with a full puck, 20 secs of loading is almost too long!\n\n----\n\nMy usual Williams technique:\n(I'm not going to both documenting today's since it was pretty much a technical difficulty)\n\n1. Soak puck in hot water for 5-10 mins\n2. Dip brush fully in water (I just soak mine)\n3. Shake/jostle brush about 2 times to reduce water.\n4. Load brush: 20 secs\n5. Work up in bowl to an elastic, slick lather!\n\n(This is good for my brush. A larger brush that holds more water would need adjustment, etc.)\n\nScent strength - Day 1-2: 3-4/10; Day 4-5: 2-3/10; Day 6-7: 2/10; Day 8-~: 1/10\n\nBest Lathers So Far:\n\n* Maybe best cut ... *Soak*: 7mins (hot); *Shake brush*: 0, but hold until drained; *Load*: 30 sec; *Addt'nl water in bowl*: 0. With this one, lather is a little thinner than what might be called creamy, but the cut result on my trouble spot was nigh perfect.\n* Easiest bowl way to creamy ... *Soak*: 7mins (hot); *Shake brush*: 3 medium-light ones; *Load*: 30 sec; *Addt'nl water in bowl*: 0.\n* The long way ... Bloomed soap (cool water) for 26 mins (that long probably not necessary), 30 sec load with barely damp brush, then ended up adding to a total of 2 tsp water. Looked more like other soaps this time as it became more elastic and hydrated. Had a little cushion, bubbles were very minimal, and was well-slick.\n* Best Face Lather ... No soap soak; Load: 60 secs; Brush Shakes: 5 med-light. First pass could have been thicker but rest were great.\n\n\n## Shave Quality\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Smooth\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Very Close Shave\n*Neck*: Few hairs are showing some tip length (with most being cut flush)\n\n----\n\n# Ending of Blades Ledger\n\nUse this to document how long our blades last, if you want, and what about them made us pitch 'em. I created a Google Form with just a few questions:\n\n[Ending of Blades Ledger](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform)\n\n[The Ledger Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing) in case you want to just look at the data.\n\nI'll keep this as my footer each SOTD so you have the link. I'll take it down if no one shows interest.",

They work well as a face and body wash. (I'm a bald brother, so I don't need shampoo) Anyways, it's one of those bar soaps that leave a sort of film on your skin when you wash but I didn't think anything of it.\n\n\nI had been having some great shaves lately and I assumed my technique had improved but that was not the reason for my good shaves. For my two shaves previous to today I tried out a different soap bar, Dr. Bronn's, which is an awesome soap and didn't leave that weird film. After prepping with the Dr. Bronn's I had some rough shaves and wondered if it was because of the soap bar change.\n\n\nToday, I switched back to the Pre de Provence and had wonderfully smooth and close shave. Could it be that the film/sticky feeling left over from the PdP is contributing to a great shave? Might be why the PdP shave soap is so good too. Anyone else experience this or use another bar soap with similar or better results?",

Last night was LFP, which is my only WK soap. In the past I can't say I've had the *best* performance out of it and never found it to be all that slick. I've gotta say now though, I dialed it in perfectly last night. Performed super good and left my face wonderfully soft. Definitely my best shave I've had with da ass dairy so far. I think in that past I was under hydrating and not adding nearly enough water. Great scent on this too, it legit smells exactly like brut but that's not a bad thing.\n\nHump day, let's get through this shit brothers. Fuck work forever",

Weird feeling to just have skin but also so nice at the same time. I look much better with a beard but it was time to shed that one off and start fresh. That NO soap is really good, was a good choice for skin that has not felt a razor in months.\n\n\nHad midterm last night that was absolutely killer. Took me 2 hours and 50 minutes to complete when I was hoping to get it done in 2 hours and maybe get a workout in or clean up a little around the house. Was not meant to be, the prof had other ideas for my night.",

I've acquired far too many soaps and splashes that I don't love, merely like. Giving them to my brother in the spirit of brotherly love. Keeping to the few that I absolutely love, which feels amazing.\n\n\nThe Fatboy isn't exactly mine. *Things are about to get heavy*\n\n\n\n\n\nMy dad died this summer. It's been hard. We'd been exploring hobbies together in his later years, including yo-yo-ing. Another was wetshaving. My brother found the Fatboy in his house, and passed it to me Monday. Both of my shaves with it we're good, but I'll be passing it back next time my brother and I get together. We think it was his father's razor.\n\n*End sappy stuff.*\n\n\nI'm also smoking probably for the last time this year. I think I've really nailed my rib recipe, so I'm finishing the year with those. Fuck yeah.\n\n**Edit:** [Well, why not show some ribbies](https://imgur.com/a/0sUuInK)",

I really like the other components of the scent though. Oud is just not my jam unfortunately. Performance was stellar, even from the small sample. Plate 4 on the Rockwell felt about the same as 3 to me, still really smooth. Overall another great shave in the books. Happy hump day wetshavers!",

And..., it was very ordinary in an excellent way. I like the longer handle on the CG head much better than the 75mm Helix the head came with, and the shave was uneventful and excellent. For me at least, there seems to be no real difference between DE and SE shaving, other than the longer SE blade life.\n\n* Soap: Eufros Vegan has grown on me - I like it about as much as the tallow in terms of performance, and this charming dank vetiver is one of my favorite scents in the line.\n\n* Frag: MB makes some reasonably priced stuff, and this EDT is one of my favorite oudhs, complex and balanced rather than a punch in the nose stinker like many oud forward scents. I think the official name is \"Mesmerising Oudh\", the two peoples separated by a common language thing.",

Just 1 nick that shut right up when I waved the styptic pencil at it.\n\nTime to go to work so I can attend all my meetings. I go to meetings, I read, and I write. Hooray for management. At least my team doesn't have to go to all these meetings so they can actually get things done? That's what I tell myself.",

The puck is getting small, and i decided to load from my palm today, so that I could get more movement on it, than when it pings around inside the mug.\n\nEven today's 50 sec load was not enough, even though the puck had been soaked in hot for a few mins. But I just went back and loaded a bit more and the lather turned out great.\n\nI think I may try again with this brush and just keep the puck in the mug. It's so big, splay-wise, that maybe it agitates the soap a little better than my boar (when the puck is small and moving around).\n\n----\n\nMy usual Williams technique:\n(I'm not going to both documenting today's since it was pretty much a technical difficulty)\n\n1. Soak puck in hot water for 5-10 mins\n2. Dip brush fully in water (I just soak mine)\n3. Shake/jostle brush about 2 times to reduce water.\n4. Load brush: 20 secs\n5. Work up in bowl to an elastic, slick lather!\n\n(This is good for my brush. A larger brush that holds more water would need adjustment, etc.)\n\nScent strength - Day 1-2: 3-4/10; Day 4-5: 2-3/10; Day 6-7: 2/10; Day 8-~: 1/10\n\nBest Lathers So Far:\n\n* Maybe best cut ... *Soak*: 7mins (hot); *Shake brush*: 0, but hold until drained; *Load*: 30 sec; *Addt'nl water in bowl*: 0. With this one, lather is a little thinner than what might be called creamy, but the cut result on my trouble spot was nigh perfect.\n* Easiest bowl way to creamy ... *Soak*: 7mins (hot); *Shake brush*: 3 medium-light ones; *Load*: 30 sec; *Addt'nl water in bowl*: 0.\n* The long way ... Bloomed soap (cool water) for 26 mins (that long probably not necessary), 30 sec load with barely damp brush, then ended up adding to a total of 2 tsp water. Looked more like other soaps this time as it became more elastic and hydrated. Had a little cushion, bubbles were very minimal, and was well-slick.\n* Best Face Lather ... No soap soak; Load: 60 secs; Brush Shakes: 5 med-light. First pass could have been thicker but rest were great.\n\n\n## Brush Notes\n*^(FS - Silvertip 22)*\n\nMan this brush has performed really well out of the box. Go with this guy if you want soft poofy clouds of puppy fur dancing on your face. Not much backbone here, folks!\n\n## Shave Quality\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Very Close Shave\n*Neck*: Few hairs are showing some tip length (with most being cut flush)\n\n----\n\n# Ending of Blades Ledger\n\nUse this to document how long our blades last, if you want, and what about them made us pitch 'em. I created a Google Form with just a few questions:\n\n[Ending of Blades Ledger](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform)\n\n[The Ledger Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing) in case you want to just look at the data.\n\nI'll keep this as my footer each SOTD so you have the link. I'll take it down if no one shows interest.",

New to me from the Bazaar is a Declaration Washington B3. This is a fantastic brush and I can't even begin to capture any pictures that reflect how great this handle looks in person.\n\nMy initial impression after first use is that this knot is noticeably dense which contributes to the scritch that the B3 is known for. The only other Declaration knot that I own which I can compare it to is the recent B6. Compared to that one the B3 doesn't have gelled tips. I definitely enjoy the added feel and am looking forward to using it again.",

Some of the storms could produce heavy rainfall. Areas of fog. High near 57. Northeast wind 5 to 10 mph. Chance of precipitation is 90%. New rainfall amounts between a half and three quarters of an inch possible. High tide at 1:25 this afternoon.\n\nNice shave this morning. Cade Riche performs admirably well. Only need 3-4 swirls around the container for enough lather and then some. This seems to be the only soap that I pair with Santal Auster. It's a nice scent, but it's not one that I love.\n\nHave a nice Thursday everyone!",

It is very easy to lather up and the [lather itself was super creamy](https://i.imgur.com/Y72lEkX.jpg). I am not sure how much water it can take though and also the post shave didn't feel as great as my usual soaps...but maybe this will change over time.\n\n\n\n\n**I hope you all have a terrific Thursday**",

I started using this soap when I planted my tomato plants in late May. I was hoping to kill the soap by the first tomato harvest. Well that didn't happen but I did keep using the soap. I took the month of Aug off for the shave challenge but resumed in September.\n\nThings I learned....an empty Parkway container weighs 56 grams.\n\nEdit: Things I learned #2\n\n* [MLS Soap labels self destruct when attempting to remove.](https://imgur.com/a/5o3cTCC)",

The scent on this is also wonderful, it's similar to Tishomingo to my nose but maybe a little sweeter or something. It's tough to describe but I definitely enjoy it. Beaudelaire, Imperial, LFP, and MFP down. Just a few more fougeres left to go in the collection. Thursday boys, we just gotta make it through today and tomorrow.

I like the smoky part of it but the apple scent comes off as too \"fake\" or candle shop-y to me. I got a really nice close shave with it though. The number 5 plate comes with the same smoothness as 3 and 4, but with a little more blade feel. It never felt harsh or aggressive though. I have to say I'm liking this razor. The only thing is about these \"adjustables\" is that I would probably just find which plate I like best and stick with it. The others would sit and collect dust. Happy Thursday shaves everyone! Almost to the weekend.\n\n​\n\n​",

Good timing on this. It was 75 in Milwaukee yesterday and 40 and windy by the time I woke up today. Autumn is back, and here to stay, I think. A great shave with Nocturne, face lathered with the lovely Glissant-base soap and finished with the smoky apple aftershave. To double up on the autumn-ness of it all, moisturized with Stirling's Autumn Glory balm. I do get a bit of burn (probably from the cinnamon) in the Nocturne aftershave splash, but no redness or irritation as it dissipates quickly. Plus, I absolutely love the scent.

      "body": "SOTD Theme Thursday 10/11\n\nLittle / Big Brush month also continues, with today being the first day on the Medium side of things. (24 mm)\n\n* Razor: Charcoal Goods Level II Brass w Torpedo 100mm handle\n* Blade: Bolzano (2)\n* Soap: B&M Nocturne (Glissant)\n* Brush: Yaqi 24mm Moka Mew Brown synth\n* Post: Duke Cannon Ice Cold Balm\n* Frag: Trumpers Sandalwood Cologne\n\nProduct Notes:\n\n* Soap: First time I used Nocturne several weeks back, the mild cinnamon content gave me much warmth and little comfort. I was prepared to sacrifice my shaving comfort for the theme today, as pumpkin and apple notes are not found in my soap collection in general, not fond of gourmand stuff --- and, marvel of marvels, no stinging at all, just a pleasant shave. Theme Thursdays have their upside!\n\n* Brush: Wonderful splay, looks a little bit less dense than other synths, but always loads and distributes enough soap for a three pass, which is all I need. Love the solid weighty and attractive handle!\n\n* Frag: Was trying to find Caron's \"L'Anarchiste\", a great dark and sour apple scent, called by one wise reviewer \"apple cider from Hell\", but could not track it down. Went with the Trumper's instead, no apples or pumpkins there, but a good \"office scent\", some personality without bombast, and well suited for the mixed seasonal weather we've been having.",

And my Sheraton reminded me how awesome it is.\n\n## Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Gillette - Sheraton with Gillette - Nacet ‹69 uses›)*\n\nMan, this blade is still strong! Great result on my shave today, and the Sheraton held it well inspiring an easy shave with no irritation. I forgot how much I enjoy this razor.\n\n## Soap Notes\n*^(CB - Porch Drinks)*\n\nTo me, the coffee scent is more like hot chocolate. I wish it was more bitter. It may be the tobacco and/or cardamom coming in, but I'm just not much of a fan of the scent. The AS had a different focus, though and I enjoyed it.\n\nA little less than 1/4 tsp of soap + 3.5 tsp water = enough soap for about 6 passes and was dialed in nicely the way I like it. So next time I'll use less soap.\n\nScent strength was low for me: 3/10\n\nPerformance was exemplary, as always with Catie's Bubbles.\n\n\n## Brush Notes\n*^(Declaration - B5 Blk)*\n\nStill a little stiff with the backbone. Bending the bristles after the shave to help it bloom more, and be less dense in the core (hopefully, that works).\n\n## Shave Quality\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Few hairs are showing some tip length (with most being cut flush)\n\n----\n\n# Ending of Blades Ledger\n\nUse this to document how long our blades last, if you want, and what about them made us pitch 'em. I created a Google Form with just a few questions:\n\n[Ending of Blades Ledger](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform)\n\n[The Ledger Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing) in case you want to just look at the data.\n\nI'll keep this as my footer each SOTD so you have the link. I'll take it down if no one shows interest.",

Today I couldn't decide if I wanted lavender, or vetiver, so I went with both! I've been told that L'Occitane has stopped making the Cade shaving cream in the tub, which is sad to hear, it's really good stuff. So, if anyone is looking for an alternative, the Simpsons Luxury Shaving Cream is almost identical in consistency and shave, and even more like each other than that! The biggest difference I notice is the scents lololol. Anyhow, anyone looking for an alternative, there you go. DFS from this setup, couldn't ask for more!\n\nIt's a little cooler again today than the day before...am I goin to have to start wearing shoes? =P\n\nHope everyone's day goes well!\n=)",

I did something a little bit different with the balm this time. Instead of just \"wiping\" it on my face and neck, I took the time to actively try to massage it in. Sort of like when you see old timey barbers massaging faces and shit. I liked the result. That is all. Also, big up to /u/youarebreakingthings for the PIF a while back! I end up liking this stuff more and more each time I use it!",

We all know B&M makes a quality product so there's no real need to get into the performance aspect of the line, but the scent, oh the scent is something I never thought I'd enjoy as a shaving product.\n\nMy initial impression on Sunday was that the Hallows line is definitely an \"Autumn in the Northeast\" scent, and my shave this morning confirmed it. It is crisp, mossy, moist and has that somewhat sickly sweet smell of decaying vegetation. Both times I've shaved with Hallows so far I felt like I was deep in the forest of the Adirondack Mountains on a foggy night, with a slight sense of foreboding like something is hiding around the next bend in the trail or behind that really big tree just outside of the campsite beyond where the fire can illuminate. When a scent can carry you into a realm of imagination like that you know that it's a good one.",

In that razor, the Personna Red performed like a dream. In this razor I have now, the Personna Reds are tuggy and bad. Polsilver Super Iridiums are super nice for 4 shaves, so I'll stick with those for now. Blades are the most YMMV aspect of wet shaving, but it's a bit extreme to have such a difference in two of the same model of razor (I know Rockwell tweaks the production every now and again, but still).\n\nI'm always glad to use the Sinfonia, and I'm surprised I don't see more talk about that release on here.",

With the three inch handle, my shaves were OK, but are phenomenal with the four inch torpedo. I do change finger position a lot on the longer handle, so maybe the more flexible grip helps.\n\n* Brush: one of RR's myriad legions of brushes. this one a \"homage\" to the skinny vintage American shave brush design the Rubberset. This one has a three band \"premium\" badger type since discontinued by the maker (or maybe renamed as \"Extra\"? I have no idea...\n\n* In any case, the brush is a Kentish type mushroom knot with a 24mm knot at the base and a bloom the size of a squirrel's head. Lot more backbone than a Kent, and excellent efficiency, but the area effect weapon that is the bloom leads to wildly inaccurate application of lather on eyebrows, earlobes, etc. Still a nice shave, and it certainly looks impressive!\n\n* Frag: Fall weather finally in effect. Let the dark dragon boat sail! Actually Drakkar is kind of like a Viking; wreaks random olfactory violence on innocent villagers. Great scent for Juniper and ISO E fans, a bit hellish for most others.",

Thanks UbaldJr. First time with CB's cream base. I read that it's easy to over load so I went lightly with a synth. Whipped up a great lather. It's superior to to the regular base imo. I dig rose and this scent is great. I see what CB was trying to do with a different jammy/fruity rose. The vetiver really brings it all together.",

The Afternoon of a Faun did not pair well with Darkfall, but it's a very good fragrance. (I think it will go better with a Fougere or Chypre soap/aftershave). It's one of those sexy fragrances, if you know what I mean. The poem that it's based on is basically about a satyr waking up and talking about his romp with the nymphs the night before so that might give an idea of what it smells like. Kind of old school, seductive, forbidden and other similar adjectives.",

SBS can hang with the big boys in lather quality. Really nice stuff. I haven't used it in a while because I am *one of those guys* that just can't use a leather, gunpowder and woody scent in hot weather. I usually prefer an alcohol based aftershave, but this aftershave provides a great face feel without feeling \"heavy\" or \"oily\". I apply it to a damp face and have no issues of it sinking into my skin. Good stuff. Great Saturday shaves to all.",

Their soap base is top notch. My favs are Aviator and Submariner.\n\n## Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Karve Bradley with Gillette - Nacet ‹70 uses›)*\n\nThe Bradley with the E plate did really well as usual. A great match with the aging Nacet. And the result was crazy good: no tips seen, cut flush (a rarity for me).\n\nAnd no irritation, even with the Alc-splash.\n\n## Soap Notes\n*^(RPS - Peerless)*\n\nPretty much a straight fir tree scent to me.. with maybe 15-20% going towards bergamot. I might combo this one with some other balancing scents, like almond or lime or pipe tobacco.\n\n1/4- tsp soap + 3.25 tsp water was a great ratio for a slick, but cushiony lather.\n\nPerformed really well! Silky sheen throughout, and great protection.\n\nNext time, I will lower the soap amount, because I had at least 2 passes left over.\n\n\n## Brush Notes\n*^(Declaration - B5 Blk)*\n\nThe post-shave splaying that I did last time seems to be paying off. It was much more comfortable this time. So glad, because these tips are just nuts.\n\n## Shave Quality\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n\n----\n\n# Ending of Blades Ledger\n\nUse this to document how long our blades last, if you want, and what about them made us pitch 'em. I created a Google Form with just a few questions:\n\n[Ending of Blades Ledger](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform)\n\n[The Ledger Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing) in case you want to just look at the data.\n\nI'll keep this as my footer each SOTD so you have the link. I'll take it down if no one shows interest.",

Gotta preserve what I have left! Haha, quite the opposite of many here, who see the last bit as a challenge to finish as fast as they can. Different strokes and all that =)\n\nI did, however, stop in the L'Occitane store recently to see with my own eyes that they in fact did not have Cade Rich in stock. Sadly, it was true (not that I was going to buy any lol), but I did notice they had the Cade frag in again, which I thought was discontinued a few years ago.that was nice to see.\n\nHappy shaving!\n=)",

May have over-loaded slightly, but I can't complain about having lots of lather through all 3 passes. Also, I would just like to say how wonderful it is to have warm lather. Maybe when I go out on my shave shopping extravaganza at the end of the month I'll run across a nice scuttle. Until then, I'm perfectly happy to keep my lather warm with my hot/cold dip set.",

It really made me want some coffee this morning. Plate 2 is way too mild for me. It was nice to be able to shave quickly without worry of being cut, but it's just not efficient enough to handle my trouble spots without 4 or 5 passes. And I'm not doing that. I think plate 4 would be the sweet spot for me if I ever purchased this razor. Have a great weekend dudes!",

Soap seems to be slicker than Ass, both in residual and overall. It's still thirsty af but seems to hold optimal slickness a bit better. It's not a giant leap in performance but man the extra residual is amazing when using a SR. Keep an eye on this stuff folks.\n\nOzymandias is probably my all time favorite APR offering. Truly some excellent smelling stuff. It's probaly the Oud that makes me love it so damn much.",

This one goes very well with LQV but they're very different. Une Amourette features a fractionated dry Patchouli which comes through wonderfully on the dry down, along with vanilla and incense. The initial burst seems citrusy, ambery, and floral, reminiscent of Vide Poche which I will pair it with the next time around. If you can get a decent priced bottle, this might be a fragrance worth checking out!\n\nEdit: revisited the initial blast and now I'm not so into it. I'd rather just wear Fourth and Pine cologne or Seville EdT but it's still worth checking out",

Loaded for longer and was rewarded from the tiny puck remnant.\n\n## Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Gillette - Flat-bottom Tech with Gillette - Nacet ‹71 uses›)*\n\nWhat a great shaver this little guy is. He's a UK Tech, so he's more efficient than the US ones. But still very smooth. He works well with new blades, and apparently old ones, too.\n\n## Soap Notes\n*^(Williams)*\n\nLoaded for 60 seconds this time, on a puck remnant that had been soaked in hot water. Had a medium amt of water left in brush and it was just right. Lather resulting was so good. slick and protective. Little bit of cushion and luxury. Plus I had extra!\n\nWhat I plan on next time is a little science-y. I'm going to repeat the whole thing again, but only change the soak water temp to cold instead of hot. And we'll see if I end up with less lather left over at the end!\n\n----\n\nMy usual Williams technique:\n(I'm not going to both documenting today's since it was pretty much a technical difficulty)\n\n1. Soak puck in hot water for 5-10 mins\n2. Dip brush fully in water (I just soak mine)\n3. Shake/jostle brush about 2 times to reduce water.\n4. Load brush: 20 secs\n5. Work up in bowl to an elastic, slick lather!\n\n(This is good for my brush. A larger brush that holds more water would need adjustment, etc.)\n\nScent strength - Day 1-2: 3-4/10; Day 4-5: 2-3/10; Day 6-7: 2/10; Day 8-~: 1/10\n\nBest Lathers So Far:\n\n* Maybe best cut ... *Soak*: 7mins (hot); *Shake brush*: 0, but hold until drained; *Load*: 30 sec; *Addt'nl water in bowl*: 0. With this one, lather is a little thinner than what might be called creamy, but the cut result on my trouble spot was nigh perfect.\n* Easiest bowl way to creamy ... *Soak*: 7mins (hot); *Shake brush*: 3 medium-light ones; *Load*: 30 sec; *Addt'nl water in bowl*: 0.\n* The long way ... Bloomed soap (cool water) for 26 mins (that long probably not necessary), 30 sec load with barely damp brush, then ended up adding to a total of 2 tsp water. Looked more like other soaps this time as it became more elastic and hydrated. Had a little cushion, bubbles were very minimal, and was well-slick.\n* Best Face Lather ... No soap soak; Load: 60 secs; Brush Shakes: 5 med-light. First pass could have been thicker but rest were great.\n\n\n## Brush Notes\n*^(TGN - ST Premium 22mm)*\n\nThese days, I'm comparing this Golden Nib ST Premium with my Frank Shaving Silvertip. Both are great, soft knots. Tomorrow, I'll try the Frank.\n\n## Shave Quality\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Few hairs are showing some tip length (with most being cut flush)\n\n----\n\n# Ending of Blades Ledger\n\nUse this to document how long our blades last, if you want, and what about them made us pitch 'em. I created a Google Form with just a few questions:\n\n[Ending of Blades Ledger](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform)\n\n[The Ledger Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing) in case you want to just look at the data.\n\nI'll keep this as my footer each SOTD so you have the link. I'll take it down if no one shows interest.",

Great shave, ran a little low on lather at the end, but it was slick enough to get by on a thin coat without returning to the puck.\n\nLooking forward to the PNW Wetshavers meetup today. It'll be nice to meet a few more of the tribe and maybe find a new home for a few of these soaps that aren't getting any love.",

I dunno, I'm not hurt, it wasn't devastating, but something was wrong, and it's bumming me out. I love Declaration, but I dunno wtf happened. My gut instinct tells me the lather was too dry...and maybe my blade is outliving it's usefulness. I don't know. I guess we all have bad shaves. Good thing I still have some drank.",

But it did pretty well, with such a paltry soapy mess.\n\n## Soap Notes\n*^(Williams)*\n\nLoaded for 60 seconds this time, on a puck remnant that had been soaked in cold water. Had a medium amt of water left in brush and it was way too thin. What a difference the hot soak makes, compared to the cold one. Maybe next time I'll try no soak.\n\n----\n\nMy usual Williams technique:\n(I'm not going to both documenting today's since it was pretty much a technical difficulty)\n\n1. Soak puck in hot water for 5-10 mins\n2. Dip brush fully in water (I just soak mine)\n3. Shake/jostle brush about 2 times to reduce water.\n4. Load brush: 20 secs\n5. Work up in bowl to an elastic, slick lather!\n\n(This is good for my brush. A larger brush that holds more water would need adjustment, etc.)\n\nScent strength - Day 1-2: 3-4/10; Day 4-5: 2-3/10; Day 6-7: 2/10; Day 8-~: 1/10\n\nBest Lathers So Far:\n\n* Maybe best cut ... *Soak*: 7mins (hot); *Shake brush*: 0, but hold until drained; *Load*: 30 sec; *Addt'nl water in bowl*: 0. With this one, lather is a little thinner than what might be called creamy, but the cut result on my trouble spot was nigh perfect.\n* Easiest bowl way to creamy ... *Soak*: 7mins (hot); *Shake brush*: 3 medium-light ones; *Load*: 30 sec; *Addt'nl water in bowl*: 0.\n* The long way ... Bloomed soap (cool water) for 26 mins (that long probably not necessary), 30 sec load with barely damp brush, then ended up adding to a total of 2 tsp water. Looked more like other soaps this time as it became more elastic and hydrated. Had a little cushion, bubbles were very minimal, and was well-slick.\n* Best Face Lather ... No soap soak; Load: 60 secs; Brush Shakes: 5 med-light. First pass could have been thicker but rest were great.\n\n\n## Shave Quality\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Very Close Shave\n*Neck*: Few hairs are showing some tip length (with most being cut flush)\n\n----\n\n# Ending of Blades Ledger\n\nUse this to document how long our blades last, if you want, and what about them made us pitch 'em. I created a Google Form with just a few questions:\n\n[Ending of Blades Ledger](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform)\n\n[The Ledger Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing) in case you want to just look at the data.\n\nI'll keep this as my footer each SOTD so you have the link. I'll take it down if no one shows interest.",

The Gold Dollar came out the best, more so because it was the one that has been professionally done so it just needed a touch up. I'll keep trying though, one thing for sure the facial hair keeps growing so i have plenty to \"test\".\n\nMy wife told me this weekend she's not a fan of B&M Roam so broke out Storybook's Hook today.",

I even used Yardley lavender bath soap lol\nWhen choosing a brush for today, I saw the Duke 3 best, and knew I haven't been giving it much attention, so today was the day! It reminded me why I keep it, it's a great brush! Anyone looking to try a badger brush, this is a great one to step into. It's a great size, not too big, not too small. It has great density, not too dense, not too sparse. It has decent backbone, not too much backbone, not too floppy. Finally, it can be found at a great price (~$75 on the second hand market). It's mufuggin Goldilocks =P that said I generally prefer 2 band, but I also like variety.\nDFS today, and lavender'd out, so good!!!\n\nHave a good'n everyone!\n=)",

However, this one is definitely growing on me, and I'd highly recommend people go grab a set before they're all sold out. It's a smooth, comforting scent with lots of complexity, and the soap itself is a top tier base from a great artisan. What more could you really ask for?",

Got down to the last three to be cut, damn chain slipped off the bar and I just couldn't get it back on. So, as it was quite warm today, came inside for a shower. To my lament, my Orange Menthol sample from Maggard's died two shaves ago.(Mental note, Black Ice from Stirling is next on my \"Try That Menthol\" list). Showered, felt a little cooler, but still wasn't satisfied. Went about my shave, didn't even have any irritation for shave #5 with this blade, it may yet surpass that Astra Superior as my favorite. Suddenly, I remembered! Lavender Mint? That's nice and cool! So, got the excess lather from my face and splashed some on. I smell like Yankee Candle or some other fancy shit, but it smells nice and I feel fifteen degrees cooler.\n\nEdit: For a Monday, and for how my morning started, today feels like a good one. It feels nice.",

I really like the clean and masculine scent of Conquest, as does my wife. Off the can the scent seems pretty mild. After lathering, the scent fully blooms and you get a bold richness. It is a very thirsty soap, I felt like the amount of water I was adding would overhydrate, but that was not the case. The tonic offered a strong burn, the menthol kicked in to cool my face down nicely.\n\nFirst shave with the Merkur 34c was fantastic. Closest shave I've had yet paired with an Israeli Red. Absolutely no irritation or knicks. Really wish I had made this my first razor.",

Love Leviathan. I was gifted a sample of a Talbot soap with the purchase of my Declaration Washington B3 off the Bazaar. I had never tried a Talbot soap before and wasn't told which sample it was but from the scent profile and Try That Soap I believe it is Lantern Hill since I get similar notes to Hallows. The lather was slick, had plenty of cushion and residual slickness. I really enjoyed it but sadly it's discontinued.",

Vide Poche happens to go with a lot of what I'm going to try and also doesn't get in the way so I'll be using it more than normal for a bit. For some reason all of the perfumes I've been trying these last couple of weeks don't seem very strong but it might be because of using bar soap in the shower? I'll have to do some research as I may not be giving these frags a fair shake. Even my Lamplight Penance sample didn't seem as strong. Anyways, just a thought. Had a great shave at least!

Lavender Sublime is amazing, WK base is amazing as always the scent however if phenomenal. Lavender and Lime are two of my favourite scents separately and didn't expect them to go well together but they do.\n\nCheshire is a nice enough scent, little heavy on the patchouli maybe for my taste, the quality of the splash though is great.\n\nPSA: When traveling don't assume hotel tumblers make good lathering bowls, shaving brushes crack them very easily.",

You can mix the aftershave and EdT to create your own concoction of scents, which while gimmicky, is actually pretty fun. Just wish it came with a separate bottle for each. Ah well, gotta go buy some bottles now.",

I really like Stirling's sheep soap base and wish they offered more of their scents in it. Finished up with Chatillon Lux's LFdL toner and unscented salve. My face is nice and moisturized on a chilly fall day, and I am really loving LFdL - my very first CL scent.

      "body": "*Razor*: **Fatip Grande**\n*Blade*: **Gillette - Nacet** (73)\n*Lather*: **Williams Mug Soap**\n*Brush*: Golden Nib - **Silvertip Premium 22mm**\n*Post*: Barrister & Mann - Reserve Cool\n\n----\n\n[Video](https://youtu.be/XsReNsbVpKE)\n\n## General Notes / Exec Summary / TL;DR\nFor Williams today, I tried a new, wet brush, no-soak, face-lathering method mentioned by /u/needsmorementhol. I used too much water I think, but it was fast and reasonable lather.\n\n## Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Fatip Grande with Gillette - Nacet ‹73 uses›)*\n\nBlade still kicking! Good combo for this average lather. result was good, and comfort was pretty high.\n\nNo irritation.\n\n## Soap Notes\n*^(Williams)*\n\nLoaded for 60 seconds this time, on a puck remnant that had not been soaked at all. I did shake water from the brush a little, but I think it had too much. There were sud blobs flying around the bathroom like biplanes around King Kong. I'll reduce that for next time.\n\nI did have to re-apply between passes, and dip back into the mug for more soap. That was a bit of a bother, having to rebuild the lather to some extent, with each pass. I hope less water allows more density to form and remain in the brush between passes.\n\n----\n\nMy usual Williams technique:\n(I'm not going to both documenting today's since it was pretty much a technical difficulty)\n\n1. Soak puck in hot water for 5-10 mins\n2. Dip brush fully in water (I just soak mine)\n3. Shake/jostle brush about 2 times to reduce water.\n4. Load brush: 20 secs\n5. Work up in bowl to an elastic, slick lather!\n\n(This is good for my brush. A larger brush that holds more water would need adjustment, etc.)\n\nScent strength - Day 1-2: 3-4/10; Day 4-5: 2-3/10; Day 6-7: 2/10; Day 8-~: 1/10\n\nBest Lathers So Far:\n\n* Maybe best cut ... *Soak*: 7mins (hot); *Shake brush*: 0, but hold until drained; *Load*: 30 sec; *Addt'nl water in bowl*: 0. With this one, lather is a little thinner than what might be called creamy, but the cut result on my trouble spot was nigh perfect.\n* Easiest bowl way to creamy ... *Soak*: 7mins (hot); *Shake brush*: 3 medium-light ones; *Load*: 30 sec; *Addt'nl water in bowl*: 0.\n* The long way ... Bloomed soap (cool water) for 26 mins (that long probably not necessary), 30 sec load with barely damp brush, then ended up adding to a total of 2 tsp water. Looked more like other soaps this time as it became more elastic and hydrated. Had a little cushion, bubbles were very minimal, and was well-slick.\n* Best Face Lather ... No soap soak; Load: 60 secs; Brush Shakes: 5 med-light. First pass could have been thicker but rest were great.\n\n\n## Shave Quality\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Few hairs are showing some tip length (with most being cut flush)\n\n----\n\n# Ending of Blades Ledger\n\nUse this to document how long our blades last, if you want, and what about them made us pitch 'em. I created a Google Form with just a few questions:\n\n[Ending of Blades Ledger](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform)\n\n[The Ledger Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing) in case you want to just look at the data.\n\nI'll keep this as my footer each SOTD so you have the link. I'll take it down if no one shows interest.",

The previous owner had pressed a sample of Stirling Glacial Lemon Chill into the tub. This morning, I had my first head shave with said tub and I was quite pleased. The soap loaded fairly easily (despite the somewhat small Latha tub size) and I was able to quickly work it up into a nice thick lather. It's a nice, simple scent that suits me quite well.\n\nAlso, I'm pleased to report that the Alchemist bath bar from Southern Witchcrafts is every bit as awesome as the Nekromantik bath bar, just in a different scent. The Alchemist bar doesn't project scent the way the Nekro bar did. However, once I got it wet and sudsy, it really opened up and had the whole shower smelling pleasantly dark, smooth and fungal (in the best possible way).\n\nToday is a great big long string of meetings as well as the last day for one of my team members. The good news is, I got the req open yesterday to backfill him. So if you know any good SDEs, I'm hiring.",

This old-school BarrBarr needs some use.\n\nMy daughter had been sick all weekend and I ended up staying home yesterday because I was up late with her Sunday night. She seemed to be doing better yesterday because though she sounded like a congested mess, she was bouncing off the walls whereas the last couple of days she was pretty lethargic and just wanted to be in bed which is not her personality at all. Last night, after she'd been asleep for awhile, she woke up crying, coughing and dry heaving. She kept grabbing her stomach saying she can't take it. After about ten minutes of that (we wanted to make sure she didn't have a big poop or something) we took her to urgent care. Of course on the way she stopped having stomach pain but we kept going anyway. We got her looked at and they had her give them a urine sample (that was fun). At the end of it they said she has an early stage UTI and she needs to drink lots of water and Pedialyte or the like and gave her a prescription for antibiotics. So far she did wake up during the night but that's fairly normal for her. As of this writing she's been coughing a little, sounds like crap and is just hanging out in her bed watching her tablet. As for me, I had planned on going to work but I slept through my alarm, which I never do. So I called in sick one more day.\n\nEdit: On the job front, I used yesterday as an opportunity to go get my drug screen done. Last night as well I got an email to sign and send my permission for a background check. I should find out more this week",

You get that slightly additional freedom from cutting yourself with the same cutting efficiency. And I must say that the R1 requires a light touch and almost a buffing action (short and quick strokes at very low pressure).\n\nThe T+S must be lauded for providing excellent slickness and residual slickness to facilitate this result. And the nice spicy cola with cocoa scent is awesome as it continues to get colder in the mornings.\n\nLather: Tallow + Steel Maya\n\nBrush: Dogwood Kamino 24mm Tuxedo\n\nRazor: Above The Tie Atlas R1\n\nBlade: Astra SP (several shaves in)\n\nPost: Maya Splash",

It has been since the start of LG games, so far too long to be without it. I loaded too much of this soft soap on this huge synthetic, but I didn't care I kept adding water and scrubbing the face lather and enjoying every minute. Post shave I just collected all the left over soap and let that sit on my face as I cleaned up, and then even forgot to add the AS or EdT, but I feel great which goes to show how much good stuff is in this bison base. I may have to repeat tomorrow to correct that misstep.",

Not a bad thing at all, just an observation. It'll be interesting to see how it does throughout the day.",

While I'm into something I haven't used in a while, I figured it's time to get back to the Brass General. Great shave as expected, and a VERY different experience. It's been quite some time since I've used any SE razor...I should use this one more often, such a great shaver for me! Artist Club style blades are so stiff, they go through anything you throw at them with eeeeaaaassseee, and that's what I need.\n\nI call this brush 'The Self Evident Truth of an Intuitive Mind' because it looks like an album of the same name that I really like, one of my favorites in fact! With that much said, I thought I'd share a pic of [today's shave](https://m.imgur.com/a/Syleylh) =)\nI don't have the light to really capture the colors, but they are intense!\n\nFor my post, I don't have anything that is a super close match on its own, so I mixed and matched to get somewhere in the ballpark. Rossa is woody with good dose of amber as the base. I could have Cade, but I wanted some of that Amber goodness too, so what better to bring that than the amber bomb that is known as MLS JURATE! This stuff is POWERFUL! Just a little dab'll do ya!!!\n\nDFS and a nice change of pace both with hardware and scents! WINNING!!!\n=)\n\nHappy shaving!\n\n\n\n",

It's soft and has little to no backbone which is super frustrating, but it also doesn't hog lather like my Bristle Brushwerks silvertip does so it's a little bit of tradeoff. I was on mobile yesterday and for whatever reason my post didn't post but I used the new Oz Shaving Foxville and it was dope! Great lather, definitely exceeded my pre-conceived notions of it and the scent was awesome, perhaps a little heavy on the clove but I'm still loving it. [Tuesday SOTD](https://imgur.com/a/6wdTcLX)",

BBS in three passes, no fuss nor muss. Only cloud in the sky is that the bronze Timeless shows little to no patina after roughly a year of use.\n\n* I own a bronze pen, a few bronze watches - patina started a few days after purchase. But the Timeless? Still looks new. I guess I can't complain. The razor is great to use, as I like the head much more than the Timeless 0.68 I own, and the handle, though a bit dull, has grown on me.\n\n",

I might revisit it in the future, but for today I wanted something that I was used to.\n\nAbsolutely stellar shave. I decided not to \"chase the dragon\" today. There are usually spots under my neck that I miss when I do a ATG, and even a clean up. Today I ignored those and got them \"close enough\". Didn't even make a difference in how my face feels normally.\n\nI finally got news about my REX Ambassador, after almost 4 whole months.\n\nWork blows, they changed our work schedule. While I am still a part time employee, we are allowed to work over 40 hours a week. Anything over 40 hours in a work week will be paid as time and a half.\n\nWhat pisses me off is that they extended our hours. So we come in earlier and get out later. So this Saturday I have an 18 hour shift to look forward to. With no over time. Because I'm not working over 40 hours.\n\nNo one else in the city has to work a fucking 18 hour day. So why do I? We get no pay raise, and no additional benefits. Just a big \"Fuck you, that's why\" from my employers.\n\nSee that bottle over there? It says it's hand sanitizer. But it's really a bottle of KY jelly, for when the city decides they want to bend us over.",

It's a very good product especially for the price. It's dense and fatty, and the slickness is impressive. I think this blade is shot though as it seemed tuggy, which I rarely get from a Perma Sharp.

I really like the scent, it's definitely nag champa forward but with the resins of the dragons blood coming through nicely. This is a much more complex scent than Stirling Nag Champa. I'm not sure I'd wear an aftershave of this, but it made for an excellent soap experience. The Timbuktu edp definitely matches well with Harmony. If anyone is looking for a good incense type fragrance, this is definitely a good pick.",

Work's been crazy go nuts but it's starting to mellow out as the week goes on. Finally got a chance to use the WR2 last night. Unfortunately, I used a crappy blade in the BBS-1 all of August, then just one use with a PSI too long ago to remember how it compares to the WR2. I will say I was very happy with my first use and how it shaved and felt. The blade feel of the WR1 is absent or at least toned down, but it remains efficient. I didn't notice any immediate irritation in my trouble areas so that's always a great sign. Gonna need a lot more time with it before reaching a conclusive opinion but I think I'll be very happy.",

I might add I use this soap any season, so that statement isn't really applicable. That said, we don't get much variation on seasons, so there's that =P\n\nThe Brass General brought another damn fine shave. This razor with any of the SV offerings is *almost* guaranteed DFS. I say *almost* because it doesn't account for user error, which could include carelessness or failure to change the blade when it's due. =P\n\nI don't usually mention frags I'm wearing, but this one is different. The evolution this one displays is out of control! It starts out as a coffee scent, then after about 30-45 minutes or so it evolves to a nice calming incense scent. It's so distinct! I don't think I've experienced any frag with this drastic of a change, but I really like it! That said, it's absolutely something for cooler weather. So, today is the day, although it will be warming up later. I'm cool with it! I'm not even a coffee drinker lol\n\nHave a good'n folks!\n=)",

I did a combo of a bit of aftershave splash and a bit of salve, which my face greatly agreed with. These blades are always at the best for me on shave number two.

Have to admit, upon first sniff, the Oilcan soap was one of my least favorite. So, I didn't even bother to sniff the splash until now. BUT, WOW. The scent in the splash is easily my favorite of the bunch -- interesting. If only this stuff had more skin goodies (like B&M Reserve splashes), it would be tough to resist even at a higher price point.\n\nAnyway, the soap provides great cushion, better than compared to Stirling.\n\nThinking I should pick up a proper shave bowl soon as I'm liking the variety by having more samples than full tubs.",

I got to smell the others I ordered (YRP & GLS) when I visited Pasteur Pharmacy last week.\nI wasn't sure I was going to like the Darkfall but it is definitely a keeper, no surprise to anyone here!! I just hope the wife likes it just as much when she gets home soon. Going to shave with it a few more times and move onto Lamplight next week which also smells amazing off the puck.\n\nThe stirling razor that came with the starter set I picked up a few weeks ago has some mixed reviews from what I've seen on here and other places, probably not the best to learn on is the main gripe, but it gets the job done for me and I am still very happy with my purchase. I'll continue using it for a few more months as I learn the art of DE shaving before looking to add a new razor to the rotation.",

I think I like JRfaT more than Tindrer though but I'll have to test it tomorrow to be sure. Over my last week of sampling fancy fragrances I've grown an appreciation for how fantastic (and reasonably priced) the offerings from the artisans on this sub are. I've tried some samples of pretty expensive perfumes that are roughly twice the price of fragrances from my favourite artisans yet not twice as good. I have found some real gems though which I might do a mini review of if I have the guts haha.",

The soap is dead easy to lather - just very soft for my technique. I assume, I would go through a tub in no time. The scent is also very pleasing, probably the nicest Barbershop type scent I have encountered so far, mainly because it is not as powdery as the usual offerings. I guess now I need to get my hands on some of the Icarus base...\n\n\n\nAll in all a fantastic shave today with the BBS-1/Ladas combination - smooth and yet so close.\n\n\n\n\n**I hope you all have a terrific Thursday**",

Don't know if I started because I was rushed that shave or not, but I haven't looked back since. Only doing the two passed gives me the same results with less irritation than three passes.\n\nWhat is everyone's preferred number of passes?\n\nFinally, I think I've been historically not putting enough water in my Declaration soaps. I get them to the point where they have a nice sheen on them, but they seem to dry out a bit by the time I'm finishing with my shave. Today I added much more water than I normally would, and was blessed with a great shave. Perhaps one of these days I'll give the Icarus base a shot.\n\nHappy almost weekend everyone.\n\nCheers!",

Decided I'd go with this soap. It was my first time using the B&M vegan base since I got this as a PIF from a fellow IRC'er. I typically don't use vegan soaps, idk why, but I just don't ever buy them really. I'm prejudice against plants I guess. This was surprising though, gave me a fairly dense lather and had good slickness. The post shave wasn't anything to write home about but it wasn't drying at all. I'm not a big rose fan but this was nice to use to see how the old vegan base stacks up to today's offerings. Shout out to the guy who has nothing to lose for letting me have this, much appreciated. Thank god it's Thursday. That much closer to the weekend.",

That thing just mows down whiskers. Changed up a few things about my post shave routine because I found I was getting some dry skin spots around my nose and cheeks. Face lathered with Nocturne, put on Stirling's post shave balm (unscented) immediately upon finishing the shave, before cleaning up. Then finished with Cetaphil Moisturizing Cream (borrowed from my wife) with a few shakes of B&M's Nocturne splash to essentially create my own moisturizing balm with the Nocturne scent. I had recently encountered a bit of burning with that aftershave due to the cinnamon content and didn't find that with this diluted mixture. The post shave scent is a bit more muted but my face feels great, a few hours later now.\n\n\nHappy Thursday all - we're almost there.",

I got my LP soap in the mail and was so excited to use it, but then as I smelled it I left myself wondering why I bought the matching aftershave when I have the frag. In my mind, I could experience the smell in the shave via the lather, and then use any unscented post shave product, and then just go straight to the frag without missing anything. That's how it *should* be, reasonably, so I thought. WRONG. The toner is a different, yet similar, and magical scent. The first few moments were really weird (different weird, not bad weird) to my nose and opened up a whole bunch of smells I never got out of the frag or soap. After a little bit, a much more familiar smell came out and just stuck with me for the couple hours before bed. As someone who often shaves at night, I was reminded that buying matching scents is a very good decision. YMMV and all that, but for me, skipping the matching post shave would be a mistake, and I was reminded of this by one of the best olfactory experiences of my shave life. Thank you so much for this scent /u/hawns, it's a true masterpiece and I have no idea why I connect with it so much.",

This one, however, is a perfect shape for the hair. This is the softest of any of the 'Finest' hair M&F I've experienced, and I can't imagine it being nice at all in a fan shape. This is already set VERY short...50mm loft, for a bulb!!!! It would have to be 46 or 48 max to keep the backbone remotely close to the perfection it's at as it stands. It's always such a crapshoot ordering custom brushes! You never *really* know what the hair will be like, boxes of chocolate and all that =P\nToday was another White Label experience, and I couldn't be happier with it! Well maybe if the White Label formula was still in production. Sigh...\n\nDamn fine shave on the third use of this blade, I'm gonna run with it until the wheels fall off, which isn't usually to many more shaves than 6 or so before I hit a rut. There will be a crumby shave, then back to good for another 6 or so shaves.\n\nHave a good one everyone!",

The Williams puck fragment is big enough to give me maybe a week's more of shaves, but small enough to make it a real headache!\n\n## Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Charcoal Goods - Lvl 2 with Gillette - Nacet ‹74 uses›)*\n\nThis razor did really well for a long time wth this aging blade, but I think maybe now it's time to switch to one of my others. It was a bit of work to get those neck hairs mowed down today.\n\n## Soap Notes\n*^(Williams)*\n\nLoaded for 90 seconds this time!, on a puck remnant that had not been soaked at all. I did shake the brush enough not to have too much water run down my face when I went to face lather.\n\nStill, I did have to re apply between passes, and dip back into the mug for more soap.\n\nI want to wear this puck out and see how far it goes. I went back and counted and have roughly 51 shaves on this puck. Pretty cool, since I was told that a puck was a 1 month amount. And I'm not trying to be stingy.\n\nBut it is taking a lot of loading to get enough soap. I think I'll have to start hot soaking it just to make loading less time consuming. I'm guessing I have a week left on this puck.\n\n----\n\nMy usual Williams technique:\n(I'm not going to both documenting today's since it was pretty much a technical difficulty)\n\n1. Soak puck in hot water for 5-10 mins\n2. Dip brush fully in water (I just soak mine)\n3. Shake/jostle brush about 2 times to reduce water.\n4. Load brush: 20 secs\n5. Work up in bowl to an elastic, slick lather!\n\n(This is good for my brush. A larger brush that holds more water would need adjustment, etc.)\n\nScent strength - Day 1-2: 3-4/10; Day 4-5: 2-3/10; Day 6-7: 2/10; Day 8-~: 1/10\n\nBest Lathers So Far:\n\n* Maybe best cut ... *Soak*: 7mins (hot); *Shake brush*: 0, but hold until drained; *Load*: 30 sec; *Addt'nl water in bowl*: 0. With this one, lather is a little thinner than what might be called creamy, but the cut result on my trouble spot was nigh perfect.\n* Easiest bowl way to creamy ... *Soak*: 7mins (hot); *Shake brush*: 3 medium-light ones; *Load*: 30 sec; *Addt'nl water in bowl*: 0.\n* The long way ... Bloomed soap (cool water) for 26 mins (that long probably not necessary), 30 sec load with barely damp brush, then ended up adding to a total of 2 tsp water. Looked more like other soaps this time as it became more elastic and hydrated. Had a little cushion, bubbles were very minimal, and was well-slick.\n* Best Face Lather ... No soap soak; Load: 60 secs; Brush Shakes: 5 med-light. First pass could have been thicker but rest were great.\n\n\n## Brush Notes\n*^(FS - Silvertip 22)*\n\nI think I got a little brush burn from this guy today. I don't think he's a good match for when I face lather and have to build up the lather a few times on my face. Especially when it's a bit thin. My Williams puck is small these days, and being troublesome.\n\n## Shave Quality\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Very Close Shave\n*Neck*: Few hairs are showing some tip length (with most being cut flush)\n\n----\n\n# Ending of Blades Ledger\n\nUse this to document how long our blades last, if you want, and what about them made us pitch 'em. I created a Google Form with just a few questions:\n\n[Ending of Blades Ledger](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform)\n\n[The Ledger Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing) in case you want to just look at the data.\n\nI'll keep this as my footer each SOTD so you have the link. I'll take it down if no one shows interest.",

Yes, it's a stupid waste of my time and money. But the worst part is, I had to drive two hours away after work and get a hotel room just so I could make sure I was here in time. Ugh. Thankfully, I asked my kids yesterday when I was packing up which soap and aftershave to pack. They grudgingly agreed on Seville, so I grabbed the matching EdT and am now just wasting time before I drive to the testing center. So, even though I missed a day of work and will be bored out of my skull, at least the shave was good and I smell great today. Happy Friday folks!",

Shawn and Scott knocked it out of the park with this one.\n\nNow back to changing diapers and helping my wife feed this little monster. He had his first doctor's appointment yesterday and apparently, he's a hoss already. He's gained a half a pound since birth!",

The fruit notes are ripe to the point of almost over ripe in a good way. The woods, oil, leather and musk nicely round out the fragrance into something warm and refined, while also being complex and somewhat challenging (in the best way possible). This is a true masterpiece of perfumery.",

      "body": "*Razor*: **Timeless .95**\n*Blade*: **Gillette - Nacet** (75)\n*Lather*: **Williams Mug Soap**\n*Brush*: Declaration Grooming - **B5** Badger 24mm Blk Tall\n*Post*: Old Spice (Original); Nivea Post Shave Balm Sensitive\n\n----\n\n[Video](https://youtu.be/ulVyQIdD9OQ)\n\n## General Notes / Exec Summary / TL;DR\nBack to getting tons of lathers from Williams. And the Timeless 95 did much better than the Charcoal Goods from yesterday. This was a shave after a long day on the road.\n\n## Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Timeless .95 with Gillette - Nacet ‹75 uses›)*\n\nWas a great comfortable shave! No pulling. It did take another touch-up pass to get the problem neck area cut properly, but this 75-use blade did it!\n\nSo, for this blade right now, it looks like the .95 from Timeless has much better geometry for my shave. I'll be putting down the CG until i'm on my next blade.\n\nTiny bit of irritation, but that was probably due to me buffing too much in a fringe neck area without enough suds on there.\n\n## Soap Notes\n*^(Williams)*\n\nLoaded for 90 seconds again, on a puck remnant that had not been soaked at all. The good news is that I was able to press the puck down into the corner of the bottom of a new container... and it stuck there. That was key to me finally back to getting a great lather from Williams again.\n\nI want to wear this puck out and see how far it goes. I went back and counted and have roughly 52 shaves on this puck. Pretty cool, since I was told that a puck would give about a month of shaves. And I'm not trying to be super stingy.\n\nI have mostly soaked this puck, so i think this is proof that you don't *have* to waste soap if you soak. Of course, for a complete comparison, I'd have to load up another Williams puck and use it for another few months, without soaking, to see if there is a conclusive difference.\n\nToday, I didn't soak, and the lather was great. I loaded for 90 seconds though. Ended up with maybe 2-3 passes extra, so maybe a 45 second load (given this small puck chunk) is more economical.\n\n----\n\nMy usual Williams technique:\n(I'm not going to both documenting today's since it was pretty much a technical difficulty)\n\n1. Soak puck in hot water for 5-10 mins\n2. Dip brush fully in water (I just soak mine)\n3. Shake/jostle brush about 2 times to reduce water.\n4. Load brush: 20 secs\n5. Work up in bowl to an elastic, slick lather!\n\n(This is good for my brush. A larger brush that holds more water would need adjustment, etc.)\n\nScent strength - Day 1-2: 3-4/10; Day 4-5: 2-3/10; Day 6-7: 2/10; Day 8-~: 1/10\n\nBest Lathers So Far:\n\n* Maybe best cut ... *Soak*: 7mins (hot); *Shake brush*: 0, but hold until drained; *Load*: 30 sec; *Addt'nl water in bowl*: 0. With this one, lather is a little thinner than what might be called creamy, but the cut result on my trouble spot was nigh perfect.\n* Easiest bowl way to creamy ... *Soak*: 7mins (hot); *Shake brush*: 3 medium-light ones; *Load*: 30 sec; *Addt'nl water in bowl*: 0.\n* The long way ... Bloomed soap (cool water) for 26 mins (that long probably not necessary), 30 sec load with barely damp brush, then ended up adding to a total of 2 tsp water. Looked more like other soaps this time as it became more elastic and hydrated. Had a little cushion, bubbles were very minimal, and was well-slick.\n* Best Face Lather ... No soap soak; Load: 60 secs; Brush Shakes: 5 med-light. First pass could have been thicker but rest were great.\n\n\n## Brush Notes\n*^(Declaration - B5 Blk)*\n\nBrush was a little firm this time. But that was perhaps because it had been closed up in a travel tube for several hours. After use, I bent back the hairs and split it open more and will see how it acts tomorrow.\n\n## Shave Quality\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Very Close Shave\n*Neck*: Few hairs are showing some tip length (with most being cut flush)\n\n----\n\n# Ending of Blades Ledger\n\nUse this to document how long our blades last, if you want, and what about them made us pitch 'em. I created a Google Form with just a few questions:\n\n[Ending of Blades Ledger](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform)\n\n[The Ledger Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing) in case you want to just look at the data.\n\nI'll keep this as my footer each SOTD so you have the link. I'll take it down if no one shows interest.",

When I got it I bought it in reviews that it had great backbone with soft tips. I got a dud...this is FAR from soft tips. I gave it a little over a month of I think every other day use, and it was still broom-esque, so I shelved it. I recently acquired a C&R handle, but the knot in it was too tall for my liking, and a bulb, so I pulled it. It pulled right out without any effort whatsoever, I think whoever set it used gorilla glue or something...shrug. I sanded the elite plug to give some texture for the silicone to adhere to, and set it. The socket is about 18mm deep, so the loft is pretty short, and I don't think it's doing this hand broom of a knot any favors. I'll probably pull it, but I'll give it some time to see if it fixes up. I do that.\n\nAside from the uncomfortable brush, I had a pretty good shave, I did get a couple of weepers, but these were in places that if I use a little too much pressure I get them, so it isn't a big deal. This may have been the garbage hump shave that leads to smoother shaves again. Tomorrow will tell.\n\nHappy Friday fellow wet shavers!!!\n=)",

      "body": "SOTD Firday 8/19\n\n* Razor: Timeless Bronze SB\n* Blade: Polisilver (5)\n* Brush: Stirling 24mm Fan Badger\n* Soap: Wholly Kaw Tallow Padre Leone\n* Post: Aqua Velva 5 in 1 Sensitive Balm\n* Frag: Van Cleef & Arpels Tsar EDT\n\n* Product Notes:\n\n* Razor / Blade: An effective though unexciting combo. BBS in three passes, minimal blade feel, no irritation, blade feels like it could last for another 20 shaves. Ho Hum, it's like owning a Toyota - nothing but boring predictable reliable efficiency and effective function day in and out. Thank goodness I don't have to shave with this stuff every day! Where'd that Blackbird and Gillette Silver Blue pack go...\n\n* Brush: Speaking of dull, the 24mm middle bracket in the \"Three Bears of Brushes\" month has been equally mellow. The Stirling is an amazing bargain and does exactly what it's supposed to. Full stop. Perhaps the most amazing thing about this brush is that for $40, the Stirling branding on the handle is still fully legible, something that Kents and Shavemacs costing more than thrice the price could not manage.\n\n* The Small brush tier had some fun ones in it, and I suspect the Big brush tier (pending) will have some fun as well, but all the \"just right\" brushes seems to offer great shaves and no drama. Probably a good thing I guess.\n\n* Frag: If I were President, every American male would receive a bottle of Tsar. It is an amazing scent, complex and interesting with each and every wearing, great in all seasons, and all settings. And cheap too! Great stuff - hard to believe this and VCA Pour Homme are made by the same company,,,",

Southwest wind 10 to 15 mph. High tide at 9:08 tonight.\n\nVery nice shave this morning. While I don't have anything that is a match for Passiflora, there is enough versatility in the soap to use a lot of different scents. Was going to go with Catalan's Prairie, but called an audible at the last minute to go with Fern; so it's a nice, fruity scent that strays to the greener side.\n\nHave a nice Saturday all!",

I jumped on Amazon and ordered some blades and decided I'd give it a go on the weekend just in case I mutilated myself. As others have mentioned, it does provide a lot of audible feedback. It also required an angle that was very different from what I'm used to with DE razors. I took it slow and wound up with a great shave.\n\nThis was also my first go with Visions and Revisions. I've been wanting to try it for a while. The soap was a lot more tea than citrus and the splash was a lot more citrus than tea. All in all a nice set. Though I did miss the alcohol hit when I applied the splash.",

I'm doing a little den clearing, and trying to kill tubs as a supplement to that. I'm about halfway through the aftershave, and maybe a little less than that through the soap. But, I've been wetshaving for over a year now and never actually finished a soap. With Beaudelaire coming back and (hopefully) Flowers in the Dark coming back as a permanent offering, I need some stuff gone before I can justify buying more sets.\n\nDay before yesterday, I tried YSL L'Homme, and it was fine, but very generic and short lived on my skin.\n\nToday, it's Tam Dao. The opening is a bit harsh before settling down fairly quickly into a creamy sandalwood. There is very little projection, which I think is appropriate for a scent like this, so not many people around will be catching whiffs. So far, so good.",

I finally got a absolute *killer* lather with Icarus base. Honestly it finally clicked once I used a Synthetic with it. With the dense badgers I always had a hard time getting a thick and protective lather. Using a synthetic I was able to load plenty of soap and get that dense shiny lather we all love. Can't say I love the scent on this stuff but I understand why people love it. I just don't love the florals. After shaving I rinsed my face off and then put the excess lather back on my face and let it dry while I brushed my teeth. Carefully wiped it off and my face was so soft. I for sure could have gone without an aftershave but why the fuck would I do that? My wife hates 4&P but IDGAF and splashed that all over my face because I love the scent and I love that menthol. Now my face is even softer. Great shave. It took me awhile but I understand the hype behind Icarus. I'm pretty sure I still prefer the bison base for its density but this is for sure the best post shave on the market with incredible slickness.",

Great shave!\n\n## Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Karve Bradley with Gillette - Nacet ‹76 uses›)*\n\nThis may be the best razor for this blade at it's current age. Was able to do a normal amount of passes and get a very good shave, on par with those that I get with young blades. No irritation. Very enjoyable.\n\n## Soap Notes\n*^(Arko)*\n\nMy first time with Arko! I had shredded it and put the shreds on two paper plates to air out for 2 weeks. Man, it stunk up my room for about 5 days at first! The scent greatly reduced and is mild now, with the lemon part of the scent now hard to detect at all. Then I pressed the shreds into a container.\n\nPerformed very well. Superbly slick, with an almost silk-like feel, despite not all that much cushion. Easy to whip up. I can see why people love this soap.\n\n30 sec (20 dry/10 wet) load time with a dense badger brush + 3 tsp of water = plenty of lather. Maybe reduce that by 10 sec next time.\n\nThis may be one of the most economical of soaps out there. I've heard one stick lasts for a very long time. I did not feel my skin drying after using it, but I hear that's a problem with some dry skin folks. But for everyone else, I think this is a great low-cost soap in general, especially if you shred it and let the scent dissipate.\n\n\n## Brush Notes\n*^(Declaration - B5 Blk)*\n\nBrush handled and felt really good today. I'm happy with bending it around after each shave to promote splay. I think that's reducing the center density to where I like it.\n\n## Shave Quality\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Few hairs are showing some tip length (with most being cut flush)\n\n----\n\n# Ending of Blades Ledger\n\nUse this to document how long our blades last, if you want, and what about them made us pitch 'em. I created a Google Form with just a few questions:\n\n[Ending of Blades Ledger](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform)\n\n[The Ledger Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing) in case you want to just look at the data.\n\nI'll keep this as my footer each SOTD so you have the link. I'll take it down if no one shows interest.",

The scent gets a lot of love but has a reputation for being polarizing. When I received the sample, off the puck it smelled to me like an old man with a big Thermos of stale coffee working out in the garage. I wasn't sure I would like it. Now that I've smelled it lathered and used the aftershave splash... I think I'm actually really fond of it. More like a morning cup of coffee on a chilly day under a flannel blanket. The coffee, leather, and sandalwood play really well together. I want to get through the samples but there may be a soap/splash/EdT order in my future, and I would have never thought I would say that after my first smell of the unlathered soap.\n\nAs for this Saturday, I went [full Wisconsin](https://photos.app.goo.gl/2P3YuUgoL3qP616M8) today when a stray snow shower, the first of the season, hit right during my late fall mow.

But landed in a good place.\n\n## Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Karve - Christopher Bradley with Gillette - Nacet ‹77 uses›)*\n\nBlade and razor did well. Comfy shave. i did have to do one extra touch-up on my trouble spot, though. No irritation.\n\n## Soap Notes\n*^(Williams Mug Soap)*\n\nLoaded for 60 seconds on a puck remnant that had not been soaked at all. It did fragment, since it's near death, which made loading a little less efficient, but I still ended up with enough lather, still with one pass to spare.\n\nI want to wear this puck out and see how far it goes. that's why I'm bothering continuing to use these small fragments, and chase them around the tub. I went back and counted and have roughly 53 shaves on this puck. Pretty cool.\n\nI have mostly soaked this puck, so i think this is proof that you don't *have* to waste soap if you soak. Of course, for a complete comparison, I'd have to load up another Williams puck and use it for another few months, without soaking, to see if there is a conclusive difference.\n\n----\n\nMy usual Williams technique:\n(I'm not going to both documenting today's since it was pretty much a technical difficulty)\n\n1. Soak puck in hot water for 5-10 mins\n2. Dip brush fully in water (I just soak mine)\n3. Shake/jostle brush about 2 times to reduce water.\n4. Load brush: 20 secs\n5. Work up in bowl to an elastic, slick lather!\n\n(This is good for my brush. A larger brush that holds more water would need adjustment, etc.)\n\nScent strength - Day 1-2: 3-4/10; Day 4-5: 2-3/10; Day 6-7: 2/10; Day 8-~: 1/10\n\nBest Lathers So Far:\n\n* Maybe best cut ... *Soak*: 7mins (hot); *Shake brush*: 0, but hold until drained; *Load*: 30 sec; *Addt'nl water in bowl*: 0. With this one, lather is a little thinner than what might be called creamy, but the cut result on my trouble spot was nigh perfect.\n* Easiest bowl way to creamy ... *Soak*: 7mins (hot); *Shake brush*: 3 medium-light ones; *Load*: 30 sec; *Addt'nl water in bowl*: 0.\n* The long way ... Bloomed soap (cool water) for 26 mins (that long probably not necessary), 30 sec load with barely damp brush, then ended up adding to a total of 2 tsp water. Looked more like other soaps this time as it became more elastic and hydrated. Had a little cushion, bubbles were very minimal, and was well-slick.\n* Best Face Lather ... No soap soak; Load: 60 secs; Brush Shakes: 5 med-light. First pass could have been thicker but rest were great.\n\n\n## Brush Notes\n*^(Declaration Grooming - B5 24mm Badger Blk Tall)*\n\nReally like how this brush is splaying. Angelically comfy and smooth. You could smear glass chunks on your face with this and love it.\n\n## Shave Quality\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Few hairs are showing some tip length (with most being cut flush)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm)\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

I got this set of Darkfall from him earlier this week, and I've been itching to try it out ever since. This really is an amazing fall scent paired with a top tier soap. Not much else you can say other than that it's perfect for the weather today. I would say that Darkfall , Nocturne, and Porch Drinks are probably going to be my entire rotation for the next 2-3 months.",

Guess I'm mentally prepping for the London trip in a week. Second shave with the shovelhead and I'm quite pleased with this little razor. Getting the angle right on the back of my head (where I couldn't really see the razor) was a challenge on my east-west pass, but worked out just fine on my south-north pass. My dome is BBS with no nicks, cuts, or weepers. Maybe one of the shave shops I'm intending to visit in London will have the PTFE coated blades. If not, I can always get them online. There's a seller on Amazon (something like Electron Microscope Supply or something) that sells them by the 1000. Even at that volume, the damn things are more expensive than Feathers. I just can't imagine buying literally hundreds of dollars of blades all at one go.\n\nOn an unrelated note, anybody who's used computers for a significant length of time has probably used the asterisk (*) as a wildcard character. It's pretty universal in computing that if you need a stand-in or catch-all for anything and everything that matches whatever you need, you just drop in an asterisk. A lot of people never stop to think about it, but computers don't actually know anything about letters, symbols, words, and stuff. All computers know about are 1s and 0s and how to line them up to make numbers and how to do math on those numbers. When you type in your shave of the day, ever letter, comma, and period has to be converted to numbers in order for the computer to handle it. In order to do the conversion back and forth, somebody had to make a map between the letters and symbols humans care about and the numbers that computers care about. One of the earlier (and more widely used) of these maps was the American Standard Code for Information Interchange, or ASCII. And if you go to the ASCII character map and hunt down the wild asterisk, you'll find it sitting at position 42. So when the computer tells you that the answer to life, the universe, and everything is 42, what it's telling you is that the answer is anything, everything, and whatever you need it to be. Douglas Adams was a gorram genius.",

      "body": "**Oct. 21, 2018 - Fall Penance**\n\n**Prep:** Usual\n**Brush:** Semogue Brush-Butt\n**Razor:** Schick \"New Improved\" Injector\n**Blade:** Vintage Schick (1)\n**Lather:** [Chatillon Lux/Declaration Grooming - Lamplight Penance - Soap](https://trythatsoap.com/collection/864/?product_type=soap)\n**Post Shave:** [Chatillon Lux - Lamplight Penance - Aftershave](https://trythatsoap.com/collection/864/?product_type=aftershave)\n\n\nFinally have a day off today. I was able to get in a much needed, and relaxing shave. I decided to pull out the Schick \" NEW Improved\", I meant to use one of those Chinese Schicks but I put in a vintage one instead. The shave started off Tuggy, but the blade smoothed out a lot! I got one of the smoothest shaves out of this vintage blade than I ever could off of those Chinese Schick blades.\n\n\nLet me talk about Lamp Light Penance real quick. Off of the top of the tub, I'm not a huge fan of the scent. I can smell candle wax, I can smell something that similar to kerosene.\n\nThe scent honestly reminded me a bit of the old churches in Mexico. The old wooden benches, the burning candles at the altars to the saints. It's not very pleasant.\n\nBut once the lathering began the scent transformed. I always read some of the reviews here, and people always seem to mention that a scent completely took on a new smell. I never thought I would experience something that dramatic. Automatically I was hit with a fruity, and sweet scent. I detect the berries right away, with something darker, and almost honey, or caramel like. I instantly fell in love. Good shit right here.\n\n\n\nAlso, I forget who was the one that started the Brush-Butt from Semogue. But, thank you. This brush has been my favorite boar brush to use, and I always seem to reach for it, incredibly soft, holds water well, and creates a really thick, and dense lather.",

Just got in from a long drive home. I grabbed one I've been wanting to try from [DrivenLegend's](/u/drivenlegend) Mystery Box a while back: The Trail by NO.\n\nAnd I brought in my Fat Boy to play with the aggression settings on this old blade.\n\n## Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Gillette - Fat Boy with Gillette - Nacet ‹78 uses›)*\n\nStarted with the Fatty on 4 for the first pass. Very comfortable, with no pulling or even blade feel. Smooth even.\n\nThe switched the razor up to 8 (I had tried 7 before, with good experience) for pass 2 and 3. Worked really well. That pass is normally intolerable for me, but with this smooth blade, it was not a problem. I did have to worry about direction, though. An ATG stroke on my neck would still produce some rash if I miscalculated.\n\nI did my usual 3.5 passes, but had to do another touchup in my trouble spot, getting it to an above average state. Happy about that. Blade is still strong.\n\n## Soap Notes\n*^(Noble Otter - The Trail (v1))*\n\nI used 1/4 tsp of soap, and that gave me enough lather. Next time, I might add less water and get it to have a bit more density. I think with lighter lathers, this DG Brush doesn't get it to stay within the core bristles, and the lather kinda gets killed. Even if the lather is slick enough. Maybe a downside to so much density.\n\nBut if I forced my brush down into the lather to try to shove the lather between the bristles, it seemed to do better.\n\nVery slick base, for sure.\n\nBut here's the kicker for me. I was getting some note that resembled mint the whole time. And that's just not my taste. Maybe it was the combination of Juniper and water/ozone? I could tell there were some wood scents in there, but they bowed to the mint, at least to my sniffer. I was very glad to try it, but I think I'll have to pass this one on to someone who will love it.\n\n\n## Shave Quality\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Smooth\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Few hairs are showing some tip length (with most being cut flush)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm)\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

This stuff has a long journey to evolve through, changing it's scent profile along the way, enjoyable every step of the way. Despite the nature of the scent notes, I would absolutely describe this scent as *sophisticated*. Not to mention how good CL aftershave is in general.\n\n\nI heard the song as the back drop to a certain American politician shaking hands with some Saudi government officials. Thought I'd share.

West wind 5 to 10 mph. High tide at 10;38 tonight.\n\nOkay, I know I'm late to the party on this one but I think I have found a new favorite floral. /u/phteven_j was kind enough to send me this sample awhile ago and I've put off using it under the pretext of having to clean out the remnants of my last sample out of my bowl (my laziness). This base is great, /u/kenzykat did a great job. This is V1, and it's hard to see how the base has been improved. Performance is right up there with Bison, NO, and Reserve in my opinion.\n\nThe scent is great. I was hesitant to try their soaps when they were first released as almost all of them had \"Red Wine\" as a note, and I do not like that smell. This is a great scent, it's earthy, but not overly so, floral. I am a big floral and citrus fan. And I think that this may have knocked Catalan's Prairie out of the top spot.\n\nThe aftershave is great. Leaves the skin feeling nice and moisturized. Scents on the stronger side for a splash which is nice.\n\nNote on the packaging: I prefer this sample A/S bottle a great deal more than the Maggard's spray bottle just for ease of use.\n\nHave a nice Monday everyone!",

I overloaded a good bit, which is easy to do with this cream, but I managed to get things under control. This is at least as good a se Cade Rich if not a tad better. The only thing that would hold it back from being better than Cade Rich is that it takes more product than Cade Rich. Having said that though, Baume.be cream produces a very nice lather. And tha post shave feel is quite good.\n\nMondays suck.",

It has been gone a week or so and I have a sneaking suspicion that my kid may have flushed it down the toilet. So I opted to go for this slant head instead. I have had it for a few months but have never used it. I also have had this tub of XXX for a few weeks and got this in a trade. I have been running through a bunch of AdP clones lately and figured I would give this a try. The soap was better than I expected and I do love the scent. The slant was really nice. I enjoyed the shave and it was nice and smooth. I worried that it might be too aggressive but it really wasn't. Good shave.",

Love the scent and the performance is great. unfortunately, being the introvert that I am, I didn't stay long at all. Spoke with Rod and his wife for a little bit, walked around a little bit, then left. Kind of wish I would have stayed to see what else was going to happen. Have a great day everyone!\n\nEdit to add: Man, I'm loving this A/S more and more. Getting a whiff of vanilla, then a slight hint of tobacco every now and then is great. Obviously they're mixed together, but I usually find it hard to distinguish between scents. Too bad this isn't something that will be a regularly sold item. I'd buy more of it.",

After all, when you're using Declaration soap and a Declaration brush, you've nobody but yourself to blame if the shave doesn't go well. (So sayeth the Scoot, lather be unto him)\n\nWe spent the weekend getting the house in order since my MiL will be here next weekend to watch the kids while the wife and I are in London. Curtains went up in the guest room. A new cabinet went up in the upstairs bathroom. Much cleaning was done. Now we just have to hope the kids and dogs don't ruin the house in the next 6 days.\n\nFinally, I discovered that our neighborhood bakery here in \"Little Norway\", which is spelled Sluy's, is actually pronounced \"Sly's\" (as if it belonged to someone cunning or deceitful). Apparently we're just ignoring the U in the middle there. Ok, whatever you folks say. I've got a loaf of \"Sly's\" cinnamon apple bread to take to my team today.",

I love me some heavy grinds, but this big FH throws a really solid shave, every time, without any fuss. That's hard to beat.\n\nIn other news, I'm in Ethcis class all week. That should wiggle /u/ItchyPooter's libertarian boner a little bit.\n\nNo police work this week. Just 5 days of street clothes and table top exercises with a class room full of other cops I mostly don't know. So I've been lining up my scent choices for the week, I think I'll slowly ramp up from \"huh...\" to \"what. the. actual. fuck?\" all week and see if anyone notices.\n\nMonday: Flying Hide\nTuesday: Sherlock\nWednesday: Midnight Stag\nThursday: Aether\nFriday: Shit Faced\n\nHappy Monday errbody\n\n**Edit: holy fuck this got out of hand. Thank you /u/ItchyPooter for getting me noticed in class. I was giggling like a psychopath at the back and forth.**",

      "body": "Monday 10/22 SOTD\n\nLittle / Medium / Big Brush enters it's final stage - Mammoth Brushes!\n\n* Razor: Blackland Blackbird SB, machined finish.\n* Blade: Gillette Silver Blue (3)\n* Brush: 28mm Elite Manchurian fan in Amboyna Burl handle\n* Soap: Crown King Sun Down\n* Post: Duke Cannon Ice Cold Balm\n* Frag: Lagerfeld Classic EDT\n\nProduct Notes:\n\n* Razor / Blade: After last week's boringly efficient and trouble free pairing of the Timeless Bronze SB with a Polisilver, I I thought I would live dangerously and try a razor and blade that have each given me problems in the past.\n\n* Well - the experience is equally dull -- in a good way! The Blackbird has a more ominous rep in memory than in reality. It has massive blade feel -- think The SB for OC Fans -- and the machined finish and that blade feel combine to create a draggy feeling.\n\n* The draggy feeling is pure misperception, as the razor cuts smoothly enough, and the end result is completely knick free and even less red and irritated than usual, so the design paradoxically feels harsh but finishes gently.\n* The GSB is also the perfect blade for the BB - it feels gentler in this handle than in any other I've tried it in, probably due to the relatively low blade gap. All in all, this combo is utterly painless and highly efficient - think 12 hrs + BBS.\n\n* I would call my Paradigm Ti 2 a somewhat better shaver as the perceptual context is more pleasant - but at more than twice the price. The BB is a very unusual shave, and it really does grow on one, especially with a very sharp blade --- which is what I would classify the GSB as --- which also tends to feel harsher in heads with a larger blade gap.\n\n* Soap: In the interim between B&M's Classic after shave and Reserve base soap, The Dark One leapt in with his soap version of the same inspiration of the B&M scent, Gillette's \"Sun Up\", a vintage 60s/70s AS. (Note the clever name! All that venom and a sense of humor too, albeit a mighty basic one...)\n\n* One can smell the shared common source, but the PAA / CK version is cruder and more bombastic, ironically more or less as I would have expected a cheap American AS from the Vietnam War era to smell. I have never smelled the original and cannot comment on olfactory verisimilitude, but I prefer the more subtle and elegant take from the B&M version, especially as the CK soap had a weird coppery note on first use that has only gradually faded over time.\n\n* But performance? Like the TIE Fighter or Panther Tank, this soap base is a fine invention in the hands of evil men. This is perhaps the second finest vegan base I have used, and easily outperforms Catie's vegan, Noble Otter's tallow, and more or less matches B&M Glissant. This is damn impressive work for a $15 soap, making Lord Sauron's soap a mighty compelling buy.\n\n* I feel a bit guilty using PAA / CK, but then I look over at my Iphone and then out the window at my Ford and think \"Capitalism = Bad People Doing Bad Things For Bad Reasons So I Can Have Good Products\" and I feel better for a while.\n\n* Frag: Lagerfeld Classic = The Very Poor Man's Amouage Gold. My finest buy at Marshall's ever - a complex, powdery scent that lasts forever, dries down like Heaven, and has excellent projection, all for $17.",

So instead, I palm-lathered, and made the best lather to date with no change to the soak process or load process. The blade though is showing its age. Cheeks aren't quite as smooth as they could be, and the initial pass isn't comfortable.\n\nGood shaving, guys.\n\n",

It was pretty decent. I started out way too aggressive and had to dial it back just a little bit. When I did, it wasn't the best shave ever but yielded good results. Need to practice a little more with this one but I do like it already.\n\nHappy Tuesday to all.\n\nCheers!",

I have the work equivalent of jury duty today, which will take up most of my day and not be any fun at all. Just one of the perks of being a manager, I suppose. But at least I'll smell nice.\n\nAlso, today's shave combo is brought to you by TryThatSoap's semi-random SOTD suggester. Nicely done, TryThatSoap!",

I tried Klar for the first time and was quite happy with it.\n\n## Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Blackland - Dart (Machined) with Gillette - Nacet ‹79 uses›)*\n\nToday was the 79th shave and the blade bounced back into it's middle aged form of being able to deliver a flush cut in 3.5 passes.\n\nI love the Dart. It just performs so well for me, and this blade, right now.\n\n## Soap Notes\n*^(Klar Seifen - Klassic)*\n\nThis hard puck soap is from Germany and has been around for a very long time. Lathered up great, and gave a slick lather that smelled great.\n\n50 sec of loading with my boar gave me plenty of lather. Maybe reduce it to 40 sec next time. And that was with just a minute or two of blooming, since this guy is a truly hard puck.\n\nThe scent was maybe 3-4/10 in strength, and was a classic, masculine scent. Maybe a little of: spicy, soapy, musky, and woody. Well balanced, IMO.\n\nDefinitely going to keep this one around.\n\nYou get 3.9 oz in this narrow, but tallish tin (which is easily dented), and so I could see many people grating this into a wider container. But it worked fine for me, and the smaller footprint would travel well.\n\n\n## Shave Quality\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Cut flush to where I just see the tips (above average for me)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm)\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

It's a really really great scent. Stirling Rose is a surprise scent for me - there's the rose but also a very earthy undertone is the best way I can describe it. Reminds me of India - like a vague memory rustling around in my head that I can't actually pin down. Sadly i only managed to get my hands on a 80% 2oz bottle so if somebody is looking to let go, hit me up bud.",

I used Stirling's Pumpkin Spice, which I love. I hate to say it, but I'm a huge pumpkin spice fan, so whenever fall comes around I'm always diving head first into it. Offered a great shave today with plenty loaded up in the brush. Followed it up with Ghost Town Barber which gave a great menthol kick and nice, warming smell. Paired the soap with a pumpkin delight desert which was a solid way to end off the shave today.\n\nHave a great Tuesday everyone!\n",

The first note really is like wet, rotting leaves to me. My wife thinks the soap smells like a bag of lawn clippings that got wet on Tuesday and you have to wait all week for garbage day... lol.\n\nHowever, a deeper inhale revealed some spices and a complexity that compelled me to power through. I actually really like the scent when it's lathered. It's sweet, spicy, and smells like a forest. The performance was solid, but I think I'll get it better dialed in over the next few days.\n\nRazor was definitely more aggressive than I'm used to (only ever used a Merkur 34C).

This was my first real artisan soap that I acquired, and it's gone through some...uh...learning issues in it's past. I didn't know wtf I was doing when I started. I feel like I may have ruined this soap...hear me out. The first couple times I used it, i'm pretty sure I flooded the hell out of it. Like it took weeks to dry out. Also, since it was my only soap, I took it with me when I was away for a day or two, and it had sat in the back of my hot ass car and turned to goo once or twice. The scent has greatly diminished, and when I use it now, I just can't get a nice shiny thick lather. I'm definitely planning on snagging another Black Ship set in the near future, and will know how to treat this stuff as not to jack it all up.\n\nAs a wise man once said, after grabbing his man bag and walking tall out of a conference room...\"be better tomorrow.\"\n\n​",

This Lamplight Penance is one of the strangest scents to me - the off the puck scent is misleading as the lamp oil/burning wick is the most prominent scent. Lathering this soap really brings out the sweeter notes, and while I can't pick out a lot of the florals, the orange and bourbon round things out. It absolutely nails what I'd imagine a colonial man cave to smell like, and if I had to lump it into a category, I'd say it falls under a barbershop type scent. Might have to get the EdT to see what it's all about.",

I had emailed the rep at the end of last week but she hadn't gotten back to me. I called yesterday after work and she said they were having trouble verifying with one of my old jobs. She said it would help if I had a pay stub. Well, it's been over 5 years so I don't have that, but I did find a W-2. So I scanned it and sent it to the rep. Hopefully, I'll hear about a start date soon because it's getting so slow at my current job that it's day to day whether I'll be going home.\n\nEdit: fixed the wording in the last sentence\n\nEdit 2: I just heard from the rep and I got the job.",

      "body": "Wednesday 10/24 SOTD\n\nLittle / Medium / Big Brush enters it's final stage - Mammoth Brushes!\n\n* Razor: Blackland Blackbird SB, machined finish.\n* Blade: Gillette Silver Blue (5)\n* Brush: 31 mm Kent BK12\n* Soap: Planet 9 Neroli\n* Post: Duke Cannon Ice Cold Balm\n* Frag: Guerlain Habit Rouge EDT\n\nProduct Notes:\n\n* Brush: Back when I was first getting into WS, my wife got me this as a Christmas gift. I've used it intermittently, and still much appreciate the sentiment, but this thing is kind of like a Rolls Royce of brushes - lots of alleged \"luxury\" that at best is utterly non-beneficial to proper function and at worst, detracts from same function.\n\n* Main appeal is slapping a wall of badger into your face -- and slap you will, as the Kent favors paint brush strokes far above any attempt at splaying. The slightest pressure and, woomp, the bristles are all now parallel to your face and it feels like you are shaving with a wet towel. (Wasn't that the concept behind Method Shaving?)\n\n* Anyhoo, the Kent takes one of the main fun parts of badger use away. To me, the Big Badger Thrill is when you compress the core of the knot a bit (such as when splaying) and you get a little pulse of hot water / foam come oozing out. On a cold morning, in the midpoint of a shave, this is heavenly. The BK12 though is so utterly undense at core that there is no \"hot pocket\" of water in the middle, so you just get a bit more lukewarm lather oozing out, as you would with most $20 synths. Ho hum.\n\n* The BK12 is also inefficient and tends to hog lather. In this, it is quite similar to smaller stablemate the BK8, though at least the BK12 has a bit more backbone to it due to the added (though still mediocre) density.\n\n* All in all, a sloppy shave (soap up the nostrils and in the ears), acceptable enough as I got a three pass from my usual load, and the painting motion was reasonably luxurious, but then when splay was induced, all concept of luxury faded and I was rubbing a Swiffer with foam on it over my face. This is like the really pricey mattresses they used to sell in the 80s where the owners would sink down into them as if in quicksand - shows how the definition of \"luxury\" can change dramatically over time even at the so called high end of the market. (These things currently sell for close to the price of two Declarations!)\n\n* Soap: This mainly Neroli scented soap is a bitter and sweet orange with a hint of powder and dust. A more complex and interesting neroli scent than RR's Don Marco, and the base is a far better performer, due to SmytHodges deal with the Lord Of The Pit...\n\n* Frag: HR goes perfectly with the Neroli soap, adding some flowers and more powder to the orange note, and offering a complex and long lasting dry down. Great combo!",

It's now a much richer, more resinous scent. To my nose, I get mostly lamp oil and bourbon, maybe some leather. I really enjoy it!",

It went very well and they hired me on the spot! This was the shave I needed. Love this soap and razor that I got on the bazaar from u/smallbag\n\n​\n\nThis was probably the closest shave that I have gotten yet. Now that I am comfortable with WTG and XTG, I'm starting to experiment with ATG. Going well so far. Not so sure about Voshkods, I will have to experiment with different blades. I'm also testing aquaphor as a post to help with the dry skin.",

I love this razor, I picked this up at a local shave shape while I am waiting for my replacement Rockwell 6C to arrive, its slightly more aggressive then my favorite R4 plate which is great for my thick stubble. I picked up the Whisky Bar aftershave while visiting my in-laws earlier this summer at a local barber shop and it was a hidden gem I love the scent and the fact that its mentholated.

      "body": "**Brush**: Stirling 22mm 2-band Tuxedo\n\n**Razor:** 1954 Gillette SuperSpeed\n\n**Blade:** Gillette 7 O'clock (Yellow)\n\n**Preshave:** None. NOT EVEN A HOT SHOWER.\n\n**Lather**: Arko\n\n**Aftershave:** Alum. That's it. Yeah.\n\n**Song:** [Sublime - Santeria](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0EXzv3CfKE)\n\nI set out to make this the most unpleasant, scariest shave that I could, within reason. A shave that I would never want to replicate or wish upon the innocent. I'm ready for a little suffering. A little sacrifice. [I deserve it.](https://i1.wp.com/everyinchoftarmac.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/1.gif)\n\nThis shave was awful. Easily the worst one since I started wetshaving back in February. I have never shaved without a hot shower beforehand. In my cartridge/canned goo days, I used to shave *in* the shower but this morning? None of that shit. My preshave routine was a splash of room temp water and a cold, hard stare in the mirror. The question *WHY?* bubbled up in my mind. I crammed it back down. There are way too many interpretations and answers to that question. I grabbed my Arko stick that I've used twice, ever, because I don't really like it but one of you assholes told me once that every den needs an Arko stick and also it was like $4 on Amazon. Mmmm. That industrial cleaner lemon scent. But it's actually not that bad. I've possessed worse smelling soaps. Hold on.\n\nI used this little Stirling synth brush. This was probably the least scary part of the shave. The number of brushes I own can be counted on one hand but I tend to gravitate toward slightly bigger knots. I usually use this one for my head shaves. It's fine but I suppose it's my least favorite. I used a new yellow 7 O'clock blade. I've only tried about a half-dozen different blade brands so far and my limited notes tell me these were my least favorite. I used the '54 SuperSpeed because it's the most mild shaver I own and it's small and really light and the minor germaphobe in me timidly points out that I have no idea where it's been and I just don't like it. I'm sending it free to the first person that PM's me for it.\n\nAnd but so there I am in my bathroom with my Arko. I realize how ridiculous I feel with a tee-shirt on. I've never shaved with a shirt on. I put a towel around my waist and shave that way because my shaves are wet events. Water all over the goddamn place, I need mad towels, yo. I'm in pajama pants and a tee-shirt and I'm cold and my face is cold and I just start grinding that stick on my face. I've found that it's best to go with the grain when using this stick. I get a good layer on and soak my brush in room temp water and start lathering. The lather is fine, nothing great but not as bad as Conk, which I repurposed to bath soap. The lime puck really made my jibblies smell good. The SuperSpeed is mild enough that I can hardly feel the blade at all and I found that I was already buffing spots on the first pass, which I don't normally do. I finish the first pass and sigh because the worst part of this whole fucking enterprise is about to begin: The Lining Up of The Goatee.\n\nI've actually stopped doing this part over the last couple weeks out of sheer frustration. See, when I first started wetshaving, I was also working on a goatee for the first time. And I was having a hard time getting it lined up cleanly *but only on one side!* That is fucked up to me. That I have no problem at all lining up the left side of my goat but I fuck up the right side on a consistent basis. And I did despair.\n\nBut I read on here about a thing called a shavette! Which is actually a brand name, I think. Someone smarter than I am educated me on the nuances but I cannot recall. My memory isn't that great due to all the weed I smoked in my early twenties, among other things. But I got [this shavette.](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0118BJ0PA/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&th=1) It was mostly pretty miserable. I cut myself on the right side of my goat pretty regularly. Don't get me wrong, it was lined up beautifully but the scars and wounds didn't help the look. I used that shavette for several weeks before the lightbulb over my head finally sparkled and sputtered to life. *This is not my fault* I thought. *It must be the tool! My technique is certainly not to blame.* My next purchase was [this little asshole shavette.](https://www.westcoastshaving.com/collections/all/products/wcs-replaceable-blade-straight-razor-black) After using that a dozen or fifteen times, I can confidently report to you that my technique is shitty and that I will almost definitely cut myself almost every time with any shavette. Those things sit on my shelf now. The *other* shelf. The one that doesn't get any light.\n\nI used the Equinox shavette this morning and I cut myself. It sucked. I had to hit it with a styptic pen after I was done with the whole mess because that bitch done kept bleedin'. And I will tell you that it is beyond me. It is fucking be*yond* me how some of you people do entire, multi-pass shaves with these things. I bet you do it on purpose, too. I bet you even *like* it, you sickos.\n\nI didn't even do three passes this morning. I was on 24 hours growth so I only did two. The shavette was bad but the solo-alum aftershave was pretty bad too, for its own reasons. I've actually been laying off the alum and using Thayers instead, letting it dry before I apply an alcohol aftershave or balm and I'm really liking it. I wasn't missing the alum that much. But this morning, I rubbed it on and slapped my cheeks and cleaned up. My face has felt lightly sticky and tight and dry all morning. I will put on lotion when I get to work.\n\nAlso, this song sucks and this band sucks. Fight me.\n\n> I set out to make this the most unpleasant, scariest shave that I could, within reason. A shave that I would never want to replicate.\n\nMission accomplished. This was terrible. But I will be goddamed if I don't show up to my own theme thread.\n\n",

Really impressive. I used the splash for the first time today, and it's heavier on cedar than the soap. Still, it was a nice addition. Almost Friday.....",

This time up, it's Barrister and Mann Lavanille in his Glissant base. I had this soap for just over a year as I bought it with a sample of Fougere Gothique in August of 2017. I find this soap not needing a lot of water at all. It is a quick to lather soap and one that easily shines in slickness and post shave. The base is great but not the best out there.\n\nOnto the scent. Hard to describe as I do have Lavanille much more alluring sister, Beaudelaire. Lavanille is just too sweet for my taste. The vanilla pops over the Mousse de Saxe and turns into a gourmand scent which is not for my liking. I pick up a slight Coca-Cola smell in the aftershave on the dry down of the aftershave, pretty weird.\n\n**Recommendation:** I would certainly recommend this base to anyone. The scent, not for me. If your thing is a lot of [funk](https://giphy.com/gifs/GV3aYiEP8qbao/html5) then certainly go for it. I will go after Beaudelaire sitting in the corner over there.\n\nIf you like this mini-review don't forget to like and subscribe to the channel. Bye for now!\n\n[*Cue exit music nad shill an ad, the bills aren't going to pay themselves*]",

I needed sleep yesterday more than I needed to shave.\n\n## Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Blackland - Dart, Polished with Gillette - Nacet ‹80 uses›)*\n\nSo, I love the matte/machined version of the Dart. It's right at the top of my aggression limit (I'd say a 7 maybe), so it's great for mowing down hairs and giving me a super close shave.\n\nThis new Polished Dart looks glorious, but it seems like it shaves a hair more aggressively (maybe at an 8). It seemed to leave my face with just a bit of irritation, something my Machined Dart never has (once I learned the right angle to use). I'll need more shaves to be sure, because this was just one. And the extra aggression felt could be because I had more of a beard today than usual. But that's my first impression.\n\nI did get a very close shave, though not quite as close as my machined Dart yesterday.\n\nI'll also mention that the handle on the Polished version is much more slippery, as you might expect. It is fairly easy to control the pivoting aspect, but it's a bit easy for it to slide down in your grip. Of course, this may be so evident because I have the Machined Dart in the other hand, and the micro-grooves created by that process make this razor seems so nimble and glued to your hand.\n\n## Soap Notes\n*^(Proraso - Wheat Germ & Lanolin)*\n\nSo this is a discontinued soap from Proraso that I got in a great Mystery Box from /u/drivenlegend a bit ago. He said it was good, and I agree. Had a very nice lather.\n\nI measured out 1/4 tsp of soap as usual, but that was maybe twice as much as I needed. And this one was pretty soft and a little wet. Maybe I'll let it dry out, or maybe I'll just load right from the tub next time.\n\nWas very slick, and I don't really know how to describe the scent. Kinda like MWF, so that may be the lanolin.\n\n\n## Brush Notes\n*^(Golden Nib - Silvertip Premium 22mm)*\n\nA very nice, pillowy cloud of poof is this one. Feels luxurious.\n\n## Shave Quality\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: A little irritating\n*Neck*: A little irritating\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Few hairs are showing some tip length (with most being cut flush)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm)\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

(That is, the tendency of a DE blade to move around on the posts in some DE head designs with less than meticulous tolerance settings.) He also sent me a really detailed note for use also explaining the tendency of Fatips to need extra care in centering the blade.\n\nThe Piccolo of course already comes with a dangerous reputation, widely held to be at the same level of the Muhle R41 in terms of potential cuts and irritation. Plus it's an open comb, so lots of blade feel.\n\nI had just logged in five shaves with the Blackbird SB, a relatively aggressive head with lots of blade feel, using a Polisilver blade, known for sharpness. and had no issues with that combo at all. I thought I was ready for the Piccolo. I was wrong!\n\nPass One: Piccolo and a Bolzano, a blade I find mild and efficient in every razor I've tried it in. Right cheek, no issues, lots of stubble gone. Nice! Left cheek --- hm, stubble gone, but feel kind of raw. Haven't had raw cheeks since 2015 or so - it's a fairly easy part of my face to shave...\n\nOver to above the lip. WTG, N/S, goes well enough. Then XTG, E/W and then W/E, has problems. I can feel the blade flex upwards as I shave and it's not getting much stubble off. I ease off on the pressure, leaving the area pretty stubbly. Then the chin, another trouble spot, gets a single WTG pass, and hurts a bit at the end even though I gentled up even more.\n\nThe throat goes well. I rinse off, and contemplate status. Left cheek, upper lip, and jaw are all throbbing. Continue? Or do a wave-off? I know from past experience that finishing a shave with hardware after significant first pass issues is not a wise decision. Scrap the mission, I decide.\n\nFortunately my relief bullpen is somewhat better than that of the Dodgers. I pull the Bolzano out, put it in my Paradigm Ti and finish the next two passes. the Paradigm, not exactly a mellow razor itself, feels like a Jagger by comparison to the Piccolo, and the shave resolved nicely. Tad sore at the end of it, but Cremo Cooling Balm played its usual SWAT team role and neutralized all irritation well.\n\nThanks to /u/Old_Hiker for making my shave pretty interesting! That fine chap also loaned me a wonderful 1912 GEM, which is a wonderful and mild shaver, so the yin and the yang were well balanced in his generous bequest.\n\nThe Piccolo is probably not for me. As a daily shaver with pretty ordinary stubble, the Fatip is probably overkill. The blade alignment was perfectly fine with a bit of care, and if you have a tough beard and / or shave infrequently, this might be just your cup of tea.\n\n* Razor: Fatip Piccolo / Paradigm Titanium II\n* Blade: Bolzano (1)\n* Soap: B&M Leviathan (Glissant)\n* Brush: 28mm Elite HMW three band fan in pecan wood handle\n* Post: Cremo Cooling Balm\n* Frag: Bvlgari Black EDT",

First of all, Arko. Like u/MadDingersYo, I have this stick of Arko that I've used maybe 3 times and I've had it since early on in my wetshaving journey. They all said it was a must have for every den. Boy, I really don't see why. Sure it can make a serviceable lather, but it smells like a piss biscuit and dries the ever living hell out of my face. That and I HATE the shave stick format. I much prefer face lathering with an already loaded brush and I can never seem to rub enough soap on my face to make more than 1 pass worth of lather.\n\nSame thing happened this morning. Doing a second pass with a paper thin layer of lather and an R41 is not advisable. The R41 does provide a close shave, but usually feels a little harsh, especially with a butter knife blade like Voskhod. I guess I could've went all w_e and used a Feather (soooo scary!), but I don't have any of those because I don't like 'em. The shave went okay, but I did manage to draw blood on my neck for the first time since I can't even remember, requiring the ol' styptic pencil. Again, haven't had to use that thing in ages.\n\nI used the Nivea to try and counteract any drying (cuz Arko) and the Clubman still stung like a bitch even with a layer of the balm underneath. All in all, my face doesn't feel too horrible considering the products I used and it was actually kind of fun to switch it up a bit. That being said, I think the Arko is going to the trash anyway. I don't see myself ever using it again.",

This shave wasn't so much thematically scary (oooh, the Telltale Heart continued to beat beneath the floorboards...scary) as it was practically scary. I don't think I've touched the Proraso since I bought my first tub of B&M roughly 8 months ago. I used Proraso for years. Proraso was just fine and dandy. But I can tell you that Proraso just does not compare. And when you add in a razor I'm still getting the hang of, well... there was blood this morning (that's scary, right?). Also, there was pain because that's just how it is when you apply the styptic pencil to stop the blood. So I think both of my tubs of Proraso (green & red, Merry Xmas) will be going into the \"goodbye\" pile so I can make some space in my den for all the wonderful, less scary tubs that will be coming my way.",

The soap smells like a pumpkin spice potpourri and is about mid-strong. As for performance, being a tallow and lanolin soap, I easily made a creamy and slick lather. It's not at the level of B&M Reserve or Declaration but not far from it either. The aftershave opens with a powerful vanilla and brown sugar, and rounds out with a nice pumpkin spice potpourri. It's a nice scent and the cinnamon in there didn't burn my face so that's good.",

It didn't seem right not shedding a little blood, but alas, the shave was top notch, TOP NOTCH! (Caddyshack reference.) If any of you have heard the OST, \"***Michael Kills Again***\" really ramps up the intensity and is pretty unnerving. I love it.",

Plenty slick and doing my new favorite trick of using the leftover lather on my face after the final rinse, and just wiping it off left my face nice and soft. Love the scent on this stuff too. Very nice and goes well any time of the year. It's finally Friday! Fuck am I excited about that. Halloween party tomorrow night and I'm throwing on the mullet wig and getting my white trash on whilst doing some serious binge drinking. Also got a pork butt seasoned in in the fridge awaiting the smoker for tomorrow's lunch. Gonna be a good weekend, happy Friday folks.",

Can't wait to try it out.\n\nI was hoping to get some of the stupid leaves in my yard cleaned up this weekend but of course it's supposed to rain. Other than that we'll be carving some pumpkins and setting up some Halloween decorations as well as going to a Halloween themed event at [Greenfield Village](https://www.thehenryford.org/current-events/calendar/halloween-in-greenfield-village/?gclid=CjwKCAjw9sreBRBAEiwARroYmzZpD__Bp1jOMOemIwDRakEnw1nNAuT1emK7Br2ARPZvcK2YXWGKrhoCahkQAvD_BwE).

That was fun to try.\n\n## Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Blackland - Dart - Polished with Gillette - Nacet ‹81 uses›)*\n\nWasn't a great combo for me. The risk of giving myself razor burn was ever present and I think that impacted the quality of the shave in my trouble spots. Everywhere else was great.\n\nMaybe irritation level 3/10 after the shave, though it did die down after about maybe 20 mins. Now, during the shave, the irritation felt more like a 4.\n\nSo, did this shave differ from yesterday's which had two days of growth? Not really at all. It was still pretty much just as harsh, so it looks like the Polished version is one or more levels more aggressive than the Machined version.\n\nAnd the trick I use on the Machined Dart, to bring the handle in a little to make it less harsh... doesn't work for this one. What it does is make the razor blade feel more scrapey and thin.\n\nI did experiment with angles, both more open and more closed, but wasn't able to find a happy place.\n\nThis is a hot-looking razor, but unless I find a secret on how to use it comfortably, I may have to send it back to Shane.\n\nWhat I plan to try in future shaves with it:\n\n* a younger blade\n* more tries with different angles\n\n## Soap Notes\n*^(L&L Grooming - Champs de Lavande)*\n\nThis scent has been around for a while, and I've seen other people using it. But since Lavender is in the name, I have stayed away. But I got the chance to try it today because it came in the Mystery Box I bought a while back.\n\nI'm glad I did. I can see why people like it. Though I got very little lavender (which I'm happy about) and mostly citrus, specifically, lime, I think. There were some other scents that helped form the base and ground the citrus, and I liked that. Would not be sad to shave with this for a while on a desert island. However, today's market offers just too many scents that I like better. But I'm going to keep it around because I don't really have too many L&L products.\n\n\n## Brush Notes\n*^(Declaration Grooming - B5 24mm Badger Blk Tall)*\n\nBrush was back to being a bit dense and hard in the center (not the tips, but the backbone), unfortunately.\n\n## Shave Quality\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: A little irritating\n*Neck*: A little irritating\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Many hairs show whisker tips with a little length to them\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm)\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

Coattails is a soap that always surprises me with how little I need to load to produce so much (similar to B&M Reserve and Catie's Bubbles Luxury Cream). This base was a very limited experimental run that I'm always impressed with, and excited that it's gonna be made into a more permanent offering for others to enjoy!\n\nWife had a really rough week at work so gonna take her out for a fun day and hit up a mall or two (she's dying to go to a Disney Store).

I rarely use this soap because I get a slight burning sensation. It's not real bad, but it's there. I have no idea what it is being called since the rebranding. This one goes back to when the artisan wrapped the pucks in paper and packed them in metal tins. It is one of the densest artisan soap I have. In spite of all the improvements soaps have gone through the past few years, I still like the way this one performs.",

I was eager to try Alchemist and the scent did not disappoint. Very lovely. But it was a challenging shave today I must admit. I am not sure if it was the brush, the new blade, or the soap, but I got quite a bit of irritation today. This was the first time using the Lab-Prep Personas and I am sure it will be the last. The brush is new, and only its second shave but it would not lather Alchemist well at all. I added more and more water, and I just could not get the soap to bloom. I finally settled on a thick yogurt-like consistency and stopped once I saw a bit of sheen. After 2 passes I had to give up. Too much irritation.\n\nI'll revisit the soap again in a couple of days once the irritation and redness subsides but with a synthetic Yaqi and an Israeli Red, from which I have had greater success.",

I used a Fat Boy and a Slim, set at 4. It did actually save 4-5 minutes, but the shave quality wasn't quite as good as usual on my tricky neck spot.\n\n## Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Gillette - Fat Boy with Wilkinson Sword - India ‹3 uses›)*\n\n[Someone](/u/MadDingersYo) online joked that you might be able to save time shaving by using two razors at once. I considered that worth a try, even if just for funzies. Fortunately, with forethought, there are some strokes that can work, in mirror-like fashion, for both sides of my face at once.\n\nNo irritation. And the quality of the shave was good, with my face being done about as good as I do it with one razor. My neck was done well, but not quite as good asI can do with one. I have a trouble spot next to my Adam's apple that usually needs special and strategic care.\n\n## Soap Notes\n*^(Paladin - Crossroads)*\n\nThis Soap performs well, but the sandalwood and tobacco scent is tragically overwhelmed by the menthol.\n\nAnd combine that menthol with the cold water that I shave with and.... Woof, it was a bracing shave!\n\n\n## Brush Notes\n*^(Romero - Manchurian 26mm w Love Your Shave Handle)*\n\nDid great as usual.\n\n## Shave Quality\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Smooth\n*Neck*: Smooth\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Very Close Shave\n*Neck*: Many hairs show whisker tips with a little length to them\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm)\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

This was the scent I picked for my winnings and it's pure unadulterated wood. If you like the scent of cedar, this is obviously a winner. This was also my first use of an SW soap in a full tub and it was a massively different experience than the samples. I waaaaaay overloaded it and couldn't add enough water to thin down the lather. It would've taken me 20 minutes, lol. Based on the first use, this is the thirstiest soap I've ever used, tallow or vegan. Next time I'm going to start with a wetter brush for sure. Even though the lather was thick and a little pasty, I still had a great shave. The slickness and protection were still very good so I can only imagine it gets better when properly hydrated. I would say if you've only used samples of the new SW base, don't judge it purely based on that experience. A full tub really makes a difference here. The splash is equally good. Very soothing and no tacky or greasy feeling left behind. Happy Sunday shaves all!",

Man this Snakebite burns in a great way. First time using WK, and I've got to say the ass milk base is fantastic. Super slick and protective lather. Thirstier than I expected, and I think I'll be able to dial it in much more. I enjoyed the scent and my wife loved it.\n\nI may have spent too much time chasing that BBS dragon today because I had some irritation and a nick on my jawline. I don't usually do a full ATG pass here because my skin is sensitive, but this soap's protection had me feeling confident (cocky?). Had to bust out the styptic pen and everything.\n\nI'm starting to think I won't be able to get a close enough shave with this mild of a razor and my sensitive skin. I either have to apply too much pressure or do too many passes. It's served me well, but I'll be looking for an upgrade soon.",

The lather performed well, even though I mixed it a little thick. First impression is very good.\n\nI rode the top cap on the Polished Dart in an attempt to find a less harsh shave.\n\nAnd to test the post shave characteristics of the soap, I did use any balm or AS. Face feels fine.\n\n## Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Blackland - Dart - Polished with Gillette - Nacet ‹83 uses›)*\n\nThis razor has been quite harsh with me so far, often leaving me not really wanting to be careful on my 3rd pass, rather to just do something quickly to have it be done. So my quality has suffered a bit.\n\nThis time did generate a little irritation, but it was better than before, because I opened up the handle angle and \"rode the top cap\" a bit more. This was better, but not quite better enough. We'll try something else tomorrow.\n\n## Soap Notes\n*^(Siliski Soaps - V3 Herbal Medley)*\n\nI sent my notes for this soap in to the maker. But the short of it is that I think this recipe is very good. I probably need to thin down the mix the next time I use it (by loading for less time), but it reminds me a lot of Icarus from Declaration Grooming in appearance and texture.\n\nI had a little drag, and wonder if thinning it down will address that. There wasn't all that much residual slickness.\n\nThis particular scent isn't really my bag, baby, but I could see how many might like it.\n\n\n## Brush Notes\n*^(Declaration Grooming - B5 24mm Badger Blue Handle)*\n\nThis is the first time I've used my Declaration knot in the new handle, and I love the new loft! And I was right, this handle is more ergonomic for deep bowl lathering. Loving it.\n\n## Shave Quality\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: A little irritating\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Very Close Shave\n*Neck*: Many hairs show whisker tips with a little length to them\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm)\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

I've noticed this to be true all weekend, my cheeks still feel a little course even immediately after shaving. That said, from a comfort level, it posed no obstacle. By re-including the WTG pass, I felt no tugging/pulling, and I haven't cut myself since September.\n\nGood shaving, guys.",

It is definitely in the top 2 or 3 slickest soaps I own. It really surprised me again when I used it this morning. Other aspects are probably slightly below my other favorites but man, this stuff is incredibly slick. Wonderful shave this morning especially paired with the splash. Great start to Monday.",

I haven't been active here the last few weeks, buying a house, trying to unpack, taking care of a 6 month old baby, and honestly adjusting to life without the help and support of my wife's in-laws while we lived with them, has been hard. We've both felt incredibly overwhelmed and stressed, This morning has felt a lot better though. We managed to unpack quite a bit last night, decorate a little, and it's finally starting to feel like home. It's starting to feel like we're finding ourselves and our relationship again after a little over a year of living with other people.",

It is definitely the mildest GEM style razor I've ever used, even more so than the Featherweight. I think this one will be going back to its owner sooner than expected because I just don't enjoy super mild razors. The bison performed admirably well as usual and I'm smelling blatantly manly thanks to Midnight Stag. Happy Monday!\n\n​",

I am impressed! I'm not sure if my lathers are getting better or if this soap is just good, but this was one of the slckest lathers I have ever used. Also one of the manliest smelling soaps, almost exclusively vetiver to my nose. Shaves just keep getting better with my technique.\n\n​\n\nA great shave after a great WS win by my Sox!\n\n​",

The scent on Barrbarr is great too, and my favorite barbershop scent.",

I wanted to use this huge brush with this tiny tub of soap and see how comical it would get. It wasn't what I was expecting it to be. The Omega has a lot of splay, but not much bloom at all. It was actually relatively easy to (over)load the brush.\n\nCella isn't one of my favorite soaps, but it is certainly underrated. It is inexpensive, readily available and it has been working well for people for about 120 years. It's a no frills, no nonsense soap designed to get the job done. I don't use it often, but when I do I do not hesitate to over load and make a mess.",

So that is the highlight of my day. So I decided to give it a go for my head shave. I nicked myself once and the difference in aggressiveness is much more noticeable on my head than when I'm using it on my face (versus the V3). But it was much more smooth, so a bit of a trade off. The Oleo soaps are really good for head shaving. I've tried several different soaps in the last month or so on my head and Oleo is easy to lather and rather good on the skin, so that is just what I'm looking for. I'm still using the Stirling Piacenza sample. It is a fairly light scent so it isn't likely to bother those around you, but it sure smells good. I will probably buy a full size one when this runs out.",

But this time I started with more water and ended up dialing it in to a much slicker consistency. This soap is definitely the best vegan base out there that I've tried, no joke. I think with a little more experience fine tuning the lather it will be in the conversation for one of my favorite bases over all.",

It was my first time using an A&E soap and was looking forward to trying out the tallow, goats milk and lanolin base. I'm a fan of Stirling's Executive Man so I knew this scent would be right up my alley given that they are both Aventus type scents. I admittedly have never smelled the Aventus cologne but have really enjoy the clones.\n\nThe soap base itself was fine. I got a nice cushiony and slick lather which also had a nice post shave feel. I didn't experience too much residual slickness but that's okay as I don't really try to shave without applying lather.\n\nI found the scent strength to be mid off the puck. It has less of a cologne smell than Executive Man but I still enjoyed it. I did experience a mild irritation after I face lathered the soap and also when I re-applied for a second pass which is a shame since I don't have sensitive skin and have had relatively no issues with any soaps I've tried to date. I didn't experience any irritation with the aftershave but may still have to put this up on the Bazaar if I get the same results with the soap again.\n\nThe post shave serum was fantastic. I got the light Aventus scent which matched the soap scent. It's in between a balm and aftershave and one pump was more than enough. I ended up using two, one for my face and one for my head. It absorbed quickly and instantly felt nourishing without feeling greasy.",

      "body": "Tuesday 10/30 SOTD\n\nGoldilocks Brush Month draws to its close, in the Very Big Brush phase...\n\n* Razor: Feather AS D2\n* Blade: Feather (1)\n* Brush: Dogwood Aurora 30mm Tuxedo\n* Soap: MLS Reunion\n* Post: Cremo Cooling Balm\n* Frag: Acqua Di Parma EDC\n\n* Product Notes:\n\n* Razor / Blade: I worried this new razor was going to be like the ATT M1, which for me is a four pass for sorta DFS kind of razor - i.e. inefficient, overly mild. To my pleasure, the AS D2 was quite efficient and achieved BBS in my usual three passes. I used my usual shave angle and did not have to ride the cap, and the blade feel was very mild and indeed even pleasant, phrases not normally used by me to refer to Feathers. The ATG passes in particular felt very controlled and mild.\n\n* I also see little design features on the AS D2, which came out in roughly 2014, that were emulated in some later designs. For instance, the rectangular tabs used to pin the blade in place, as opposed to the sloppier circular posts seen on most razors, even to this day.\n\n* Another interesting design feature; the very thick safety bar, which is seen in the very recent Fine Marvel design (though with a much bigger blade gap there).\n\n* Fit and finish of the AS D2 are marvelous, and the razor as a whole is both attractive and ergonomic to use. A pleasure to find this \"golden oldie\" can still bring the heat!\n\n* Brush: Because the 30mm synth did not bloom like an H Bomb test, it is still a relatively precise and manageable knot, unlike say the Kent BK12 which has become an area effect weapon over time. The big Tux loads and dispenses lather efficiently with little drama, and the Dogwood hybrid handle still looks and feels great after more than a year of frequent use.\n\n* Soap: Love the scent, but the MLS V2 base is no longer the equal of stuff like Reserve or Icarus, especially in terms of cushion and post shave.\n\n* Mike's Natural is an older base that has aged well and still competes with recent bases - but Mike's scents are bland and unimaginative. MLS on the other hand has clever and dramatic scents (Reunion's green, fresh vetiver being a good example of same). Maybe a fusion of the two brands might be the thing? Mike's base with MLS scents... I can dream, anyway!\n\n\n",

Previously I had a Stirling Badger 24mm and Maggard 2-Band 22mm and didn't like how either of them hogged lather. The Thater is the closest thing to a synthetic I've experienced. It is exceptionally efficient on soap with fantastic flow through. Despite being 24mm, it feels smaller than the Maggard 22mm. I'm wondering if the 26mm or even the 4670 will have the same efficiency and flow through, but maybe has more room to hold lather... I feel if the knot gets too big I'll run into the same lather hogging issues as the others.",

      "body": "*Razor*: **Blackland - Dart (Polished)**\n*Blade*: **Gillette - Silver Blue** (5)\n*Lather*: **Dr Jon's - Sunday Funday Extravaganza - Cold Fall Morning**\n*Brush*: **Romero - Manchurian 26mm w Love Your Shave Handle**\n*Post*: Nivea Post Shave Balm Sensitive\n\n----\n\n[Video](https://youtu.be/-IKMelsI-7Y)\n\n## General Notes / Exec Summary / TL;DR\nToday was a do or die shave for the Polished Dart from Blackland. It turns out it is probably just too aggressive for me.\n\nOn the other hand, using a young blade is an unusual occurrence for me lately. It was nice to smoothly cut through those first-pass hairs without much of a thought.\n\nAnd today was my first time with Dr Jon's Experimental monthly offerings: Cold Fall Morning.\n\n## Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Blackland - Dart - Polished with Gillette - Silver Blue ‹5 uses›)*\n\nSo the Machined Dart is a superb shaver for me, giving me some of the closest i've had with no irritation. However, his evil twin, the Polished Dart, while glorious in all its shiny beauty, is just over the line for me.\n\nI took a short break from my venerable Nacet today, as I wanted to give the PolDart a try with a young blade.\n\nChanging the handle angle to be closer to the face works great with my Machined Dart, but hasn't worked on the Polished one when I've used my old edge. Tried it on the younger blade and it was better, but still left a little irritation by the end of the shave. Face was fine, but neck felt a little raw as it came time to maybe do a touch-up... causing me to just skip it and settle for an average shave.\n\n## Soap Notes\n*^(Dr Jon's - Sunday Funday Extravaganza - Cold Fall Morning)*\n\nLoading: A medium wet badger brush swirling in the dry tub for 30 sec gave me plenty of lather. Maybe 2-3 passes more than I needed. So a shorter load time next time I think.\n\nEnjoyed the coffee and pancakes scent. Didn't pick up any pine, which I'm totally fine with. The scent doesn't exactly nail the pancakes and syrup, so that if you came at it blind, that you'd be able to pick it out. But I imagine that's a hard task anyway. But once you know, this became a comforting scent to me.\n\nI'm not a fan of menthol in either soaps or post-shave products, because it usually feels more like a burning sensation for me. However, the amount of cooling product, whatever it is, is minimal in this soap, and doesn't bother me physiologically. Dr Jon mentioned that a cool chill was a part of the scent description, and I did pick up, or I thought I picked up, a hint of menthol or something like it. .... But the thing is that for me, this soap's value is on a cool/cold morning when you want the experience of these comforting and warming items of coffee and pancakes to counteract the cold. To have the cooling effect in the soap itself may actually be a deal-breaker for me. We'll give it another try, since this shave was a bit rough.\n\nScent strength: Low. Maybe a 1/10 when just standing there with the lather on your face. But gets stronger when you're moving your brush around applying it. Maybe to a 3 then. It is just strong enough for me to like it, if I can get past the cooling effect.\n\nPerformance, as always, with Dr Jon's, was top notch. Creamy, shiny, and slick lather.\n\n\n## Brush Notes\n*^(Romero - Manchurian 26mm w Love Your Shave Handle)*\n\nDecent backbone, but I don't think too much for me. Nice soft tips.\n\n## Shave Quality\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: A little irritating\n*Neck*: A little irritating\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Many hairs show whisker tips with a little length to them\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm)\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

It's good weather for it (let's face it, ALL weather is good for Beaudelaire =P), so hell yeah! This is where the shave takes a turn. The first pass seemed a little harsher than normal, but not enough to make a big difference. The second pass is different. It was enough to make a difference. I got a couple of weepers halfway through, so I had a look at the razor. I mentally rewound to yesterday's shave and at the end I dialed the Rex up to the max. I didn't check this morning and that is what I had been shaving with lololol\nOoooooooops =P\nI finished the shave at that setting, it wasn't too bad! I did however have a little bit of a blood offering, but it isn't too bad, I'll live =)\n\nHave a good day everyone!",

Traditionally this is the first day of the year I use Hallows, and since I generally go light scent or scent free it's all the more entertaining for me! It's finally cooling off, the leaves are in full color swing, and special candies abound. Seriously, go find dark chocolate Reese's cups. Happy Halloween everyone!",

Henckels 401 11/16 FH\n**Post:** Lucky Tiger - Oil of Olay Complete\n\nSo I can home Monday ro find another unexpected package fro Will. When I opened it I found an unmarked tub of soap. I tested the PP8 batch and I assumed this new tub was the final result of all the development. I wasn't able to message Will before yesterday morning, so I didn't want to use it for my SOTD yesterday without speaking with him first.\n\nIt is indeed the final Excelsior base. This is a serious base. It is a bit firmer than PP8 which will make it less likely to be overloaded, but it still takes very little soap to make a brushfull of lather. Contrary to rumblings I have heard, it seems to have the same lather quality and characteristics of PP8 which I really liked very much. In my mind, this is an easy to use base. The post shave feel is quite good. It is up there with the best of them in that respect.",

After using the Karve exclusively for a couple weeks, it shaves so much different. It's weird, the Rex has a bit of a drag to it, it doesn't glide quite as smoothly but it cuts very well. The blade is locked down like Alcatraz which results makes it effective at cutting hairs efficiently even at the lower settings while still being mild. I do really like this razor. It's just not quite as mindless as the Karve.\n\nSeville, you guys know how I feel about this stuff. Love it. Also, Kyovu is the shit. Just picked up a few more bottles of this stuff and I'm glad I found it. It's very very good.\n\nWednesday today but tomorrow is my Friday this week since I'm taking Friday off to go Monterey tomorrow evening with my wife. Gonna have a nice relaxing trip because I have a wedding to shoot on Saturday and a family session on Sunday. Should be a good time!",

      "body": "SOTD Wed 10/31\n\nFinal day of Goldilocks brush size variation month, on the \"Big\" side of things...\n\n* Razor: Feather AS D2\n* Blade: Feather (2)\n* Brush: Dogwood Seascape 28mm Maggard badger\n* Soap: B&M Fougere Aromatique (tallow, White Label)\n* Post: Duke Cannon Ice Cold Balm\n* Frag: B&M Fougere Gothique EDP\n\nProduct Notes\n\n* Razor / Blade: Another great one from the Unexpectedly Successful Duo (kind of like seeing Taylor Swift and Mariah Carey sing a beautiful opera duet, say the [Flower Duet from Delibes' Lakme] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vf42IP__ipw).) Smooth, pleasant, efficient shave with minimal blade feel and no weird ass angle needed. The first shave yesterday gave me a six hour BBS, kind of on the low side versus what a CG or BB can offer, but 6 hours is plenty good really.\n\n* Brush: Love the Seascape! Maggard badger though is just OK, certainly nowhere near a Paladin or Declaration badger (as might be expected) but also not as dense or tightly shaped as Stirling's cheap badger. The Maggard 28mm here now looks like an A bomb test, so the actual face coverage is more like 30mm +, meaning the big guy lays down lather all over the place. It's still far superior to, say, a Kent knot, but it makes me sad that many new shavers experiencing badger for the first time will probably try a Maggard's knot and think \"what's all the fuss about\"? The value is still impressive, but hair for hair Stirling offers better cheap badger, but only in Stirling brushes, at least as far as I know.\n\n* Soap: About 2/3rds of the way through this brilliant scent. Trying my B&M voodoo doll to compel the artisan into reissuing this complex and difficult scent. The WL performance today was phenomenal, proving that old bases do not necessarily become invalid once supplanted by newer versions.\n\n* Frag: Perfect Halloween scent! Ominous, mysterious, dark, yet elegant.",

Was a bit weak in scent strength, but strong in performance.\n\n## Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Karve - Christopher Bradley with Gillette - Nacet ‹84 uses›)*\n\nUsed E plate on the razor. Old blade is still cranking.\n\nBradley gives me a great shave.\n\nNo irritation.\n\n## Soap Notes\n*^(Dr Jon's - Sunday Funday Extravaganza - Cold Fall Morning)*\n\nLoading: A medium wet badger brush swirling in the dry tub for 20 sec gave me plenty of lather. Maybe 2 passes more than I needed. 20 seconds is such a short time. I wonder if I should just let that be. Maybe try 15 next time.\n\nCoffee and pancakes scent was much more muted on the second use of the soap. And was actually hard to pick up till the end of the shave.\n\nAny cooling agent that might be in this soap, was too faint to pick up this time. Maybe the cold water I used masked it.\n\nScent strength: Low. Maybe a 1/10. Maybe a 2 when lathering. A bit low for me. And I don't know why this was lower than yesterday's shave.\n\nPerformance, as always, with Dr Jon's, was top notch. Creamy, shiny, and slick lather.\n\n\n## Brush Notes\n*^(Frank Shaving - Silvertip 22mm Purple Handle)*\n\nNot as soft as the Golden Nib Premium Silvertip, but let's give it some more uses.\n\n## Shave Quality\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Many hairs show whisker tips with a little length to them\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm)\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",
