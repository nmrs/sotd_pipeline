The roads were an ice rink. Finished shoveling my sidewalks and jumped in the shower. Today starts a very rare two days off from work. After I shave right now I am going to get some sleep. This Brian Brown razor is honestly one of the best straight razors I have owned. Simply fantastic. I have a lot to do today. I plan on going down to my part time job to grab my paycheck. On my way back I plan on hitting up a very good butcher to grab a steak for tomorrow. Once I get done with that I plan on getting some grocery shopping done. Some new blinds I ordered for my dining room are supposed to arrive today and I plan on installing them. Hopefully they will help trap some of the heat I am losing through the single pane 97 year old windows. I hope everyone enjoys their day!",

First time in over a week that my mouth isn't all swollen and in pain. I've killed off a bunch of soaps before but the same thing always happens. I get close to the bottom and then it just stops. The soap won't budge and seems to last forever. That's where I'm at with the VHCS. I think another 3 shaves might be the end but probably not.\n\nEdit: Changed the Frag at the last second. I've had a bottle of Stetson for ages and never used it. Not bad for what it is.",

I only have a couple of the Latha line, but they're both fantastic. Today is the Sandalwood. I love the scent on this. The bright fruity sweetness of the current really comes out strong, and the amber adds another layer of sweetness and a creamy feel. It's a very sweet rich scent. Perfect for autumn and winter, but might be a little cloying in the heat. Performance isn't in the best of the best category, but it's still damn good. For me its about on par with the B & M white label. Probably the tallow and butters, but its plenty slick and has a good post-shave. My only small complaint for the line, is the narrow opening on the tubs. I didn't plan it this way, but I got lucky on my brush rotation and my two smallest brushes are lined up for my two Latha soaps. It would be pretty difficult if not impossible loading up The Franklin in these. I think the bloom area is larger than the opening.\n\nI don't have a huge amber or sandalwood selection in the fragrance department. Before I've paired it with CK Obsession, which isn't that great but has a high nostalgia factor for me. Today though I went with the one amber bomb I have which is Potion. The scent reminds me a lot of Jurate, but with a slight herbal edge that runs through it. I love the scent, but doesn't have the best longevity or development. Paired very well with the Latha Sandalwood though.\n\n\n\nHave a good one!\n\n\n\n**Soaps**\n\n[<< Barrister & Mann - Hallows](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5r74bu/tuesday_sotd_thread_jan_31_2017/dd52wdy/)\n\n[Barrister & Mann - Latha Taiga >>](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5rlrbl/thursday_sotd_thread_feb_02_2017/dd8dmz2/)\n****\n\n**Tours**\n\n[Razor Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5lefc9/happy_new_year_sotd_thread_jan_01_2017/dbv6f4p/)\n\n[Brush Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5o322q/sunday_sotd_thread_jan_15_2017/dcgf5ud/)\n\n[Soap Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5q99m5/thursday_sotd_thread_jan_26_2017/dcxird1/)",

Some say that Arko dries out their skin but it was only drying on my upper lip, possibly because I did only one pass there and left it to dry while doing two other passes elsewhere. It had a lot of residual left on my face that might have given that drying feeling if I hadn't thoroughly rinsed it off.\n\nThe Clubman was a disappointment; apparently 20 largish crystals were nowhere near enough.\n",

The Barbasol felt a tiny bit smoother, less blade feel, but it felt like it was cutting better (i.e. more efficient).\n\nThe wheels fell off the bus during the second and third pass. The Barbasol was way smoother, and felt like it was slicing through cleaner. Again, like yesterday, this is no slight against the Old Type, which is tied for #1 as my favorite Gillette.\n\nQuestion: What's the smoothest moderate to aggressive Gillette razor?\n\nAnswer: NEW Raised Flat Bottom (RFB). Guess which razor is going against the Barbasol tomorrow?\n\nStay tuned for even more Grudge Matches. Ima gonna do the Old Type vs the NEW SC simply because I never use the NEW SC - I will always pick the NEW Deluxe, NEW RFB or Old Type before the NEW SC when I'm in the mood for that type of shave because they're better shavers all-around for me.",

      "body": "###SOTD: 01 February 2017\n#####Wow, I'm actually still alive edition.\n\n***Pre-Shave:*** *Hot water splashes, proto-lather.*\n***Lather:*** *Dapper Dragon* Ouroboros.\n***Brush:*** *24mm /u/andrewpalombo* Cashmere *knot in a /u/G_huck stonewood burl beehinve handle.*\n***Razor:*** *Gillette NEW Short Comb w/Astra Superior Platinum blade (17).*\n***Post-Shave:*** *Extra lather, cold water splashes, Clubman Special Reserve.*\n***Soundtrack:*** *The thudding in my head.*\n\n\n\nThe week before last, my kiddo came down sick with some type of cold or maybe a light touch of flu. He was running a fever, etc. He got over it in about two days, and then last week he gave it to his mother (good boy). I was thrilled that I'd escaped it, because normally he gives me every disease he encounters.\n\nThen I woke up Monday morning with a fever of 101.5°F. I took him to day care, came home, and went back to bed, where I remained until this morning. I still have a wicked bad headache, and feel like I fell while water skiing and let the boat drag me instead of letting go of the tether, but on the bright side, I was actually able to leave my bed and come to work this morning. Also, I'm almost done with *The Sopranos* now, although I don't know how much of it I retained given the state I've been in for the past two days.\n\nBut anyway, on to the shave: Dapper Dragon ain't nothing to mess with. I have a tub of *Ouroboros* from /u/songwind's initial \"accident\" run, and it's a great scent. The orange note gives just the right amount of sweetness to balance the sandalwood, and those two in turn combine to balance out the musk. If you've been sleeping on Dapper Dragon, stop right now and pick up some of his stuff. It's seriously top o' the line.\n\nI don't have much that pairs well with it, so I'm going to need to pick up a scale polish at some point, but in the meantime, Clubman Special Reserve does a great job. I think that leather is perhaps just a natural pairing for sandalwood and musk notes. Either way, the balance it strikes is superb. Special Reserve is easily one of my favorite drug store aftershaves besides.\n\nI've written quite a bit about the NEW SC. Suffice it to say that, at this point, it's definitely my favorite DE razor. I was shaving 4 days' growth, today, and I still got a beautiful BBS in two passes plus touch-ups, with absolutely zero irritation or discomfort. Similarly, the brush I used today is rapidly becoming my favorite brush. Both the handle and the knot are ridiculously comfortable to use, and it's incredibly efficient in terms of soap use and lather build/release.\n\nHappy Wednesday, everyone. Time to pack 6 days worth of work into 3 while working at 60% capacity. Yuck.\n",

It was still smoother and more efficient than any DE razor I've tried, but it was a little harsher than the other GEMs I've been using. For the first time in weeks, I've got a little irritation on my neck, and I'm not a fan of that. I'll probably spend a little more time with this razor to make up my mind, but it will most likely end up on the bazaar.\n\nHave a great day!",

I got Tishomingo and knew I had to use Catalan's Prairie with it. CP is still my favorite Chatillon Lux scent and I'm sad it wasn't popular enough to stay, but I have a bottle of toner and a jar of salve that'll last me a good while. The brush is breaking in real nicely and the tips are starting to hook. I swear the Washington is stupid easy to lather compared to the other two sizes, at least for me because I seem to always underload with the Franklin and \"Jefferson.\" The Calypso is also giving really nice shaves. I'm going to have to get myself one down the line if my current razors aren't cutting it (hah).",

I don't think I added enough water yesterday - today's lather seemed much more cushiony and a bit slicker.\n\nThis Astra blade is starting to feel just a tiny bit tuggy, so I'm thinking I might go one or two more shaves on it. Did a nice 3-pass on my face, totally avoiding my neck again.\n\nI think I have been getting a bit cocky with my angle, as today I \"rode the safety bar\" of the razor and had a much more comfortable shave.\n\nThis Fine L'orange Noir aftershave smells great. I'm interested to see how long it will last. It doesn't have all the crazy good-for-your-skin ingredients as some of the other splashes I've been using, but my skin feels pretty nice after using it still. I also have a bottle of the American Blend coming as well (thanks for putting my 3 items into 3 different shipments, Amazon). Maybe I'll also pick up a bottle of Snake Bite for when I want an unscented splash.",

Except for the beginning. My first two strokes cut no hair. After the first, I thought my angle was off - I was playing around with angles, so I figured the angle was too steep. No problem, right? Second stroke: used a less steep angle that I know would cut - still didn't cut, wtf gives? My dumb ass forgot to load a blade in the razor -__- I've been taking SOTD pictures without blades for the past couple days, so I guess I forgot about putting one in since the razor was already assembled. As /u/MrAdamLerner put it.. I think this is worse than shaving with the base plate upside-down. At least the shave *after* I put in the blade was good.",

Always surprised how much I like the shave. Got the Graphite yesterday so wanted to really test it out today and figured just a straight Sandalwood shave scent would be best. Really like the way this juice smells. A little spicy at first from pepper then dry woods. Reviews said pencil shavings and I'll agree. But they are the nicest pencil shavings I have ever smelled. This is going to get a lot of use in the next few months.",

After yesterday's revelation that the Barbasol Floating head is both smoother and more efficient than my Old Type, I went with an ultra-smooth razor today to see how it compares.\n\nUp for the challenge was the smooth-as-glass NEW RFB - the best compromise between smoothness and efficiency of any DE razor I own. Finally, the predicted results match the actual results. The Barbasol is more efficient and the NEW RFB is smoother. That was 7am.\n\nAs I write this, here we are 3 hours later and something does not compute. The Barbasol side growth is coming in faster than the RFB side, indicating that the RFB actually shaved closer despite the fact that the Barbasol felt like it was shaving more efficiently. It's either magic, or the fact that I'm right-handed and the Barbasol was used on the left side of my face.\n\nFinished off another soap sample - woohoo! I got this sample last September from /u/luemasify when I bought his RR Disruptor.",

I feel a ton better than I have so far this week, but jeez, I feel like I could sleep for a month. My back is killing me.\n\nI needed to order a sample of Wholly Kaw's *Lav Sublime* for March Madness, so I figured that I may as well check out a few more scents while I was there. When he announced the release of *Cuero Oscuro* last year, my interest was immediately piqued, but then life got in the way and I never got around to ordering it. Regardless, it was definitely on my list. This morning, I broke my Wholly Kaw cherry with it.\n\nBut beforehand, when I opened the mail last night, I did give it the patented /u/bald_and_beardless sniff test. Out of the tub, it's actually somewhat overwhelming. Most of what I got was a very strong, very bitter, very smoky coffee scent. So bitter and smoky, it borders on acrid. The leather note comes through a bit, but it's very much in the background.\n\nBut hey, the real test is in the lather, yes? The scent smooths out tremendously when lathered, and the leather comes straight to the front. This note is more like a leather boot than a leather couch. The coffee becomes much more muted, from a note of cowboy coffee over a campfire to a sultry dark roast. The cedarwood, vetiver and tobacco notes float into the middle of everything and lend the whole thing a hint of something that isn't quite sweetness, but it does take the bite out of it nicely. Overall it's a nice, warm leathery scent that sort of reminds me of *Green Dragon's* older, unrefined, trail-worn, street-educated cousin. Is it my favorite leather scent? Not sure, though I do really like it. Maybe March Madness next year will be leather scents so I can decide. Its performance, though, is unimpeachable. Username checks out: /u/whollykaw's tallow base is among the best I've used, and it was really easy to dial in. I'm looking forward to checking out the vegan base as well, but I think I'll hold off on that until March when I use *Lav Sublime* for the first time. Part of the fun of that competition is figuring out how to dial in soaps that I've never used on the fly to see how easy they are.\n\nIt pairs nicely with *Hallows.* The vetiver notes seem to mesh up, and the cocoa note sweetens the coffee note ever so slightly. When I first splashed it on, I'd thought that the soap scent had dissipated, which was fine because it's soap, but now, 4-ish hours after my shave, I'm still getting those leather notes coming through. Delicious.\n\nHappy Thursday, everyone. Enjoy your shaves.\n\n\n\n-----\n\n**EDIT:** *Copy/paste error: incorrect date.*",

I'm very familiar with the great performance of /u/ryan_tallowandsteel 's soap, but this was my first go with Rainforest. I have no idea if it actually smells like a rain forest, but this is an absolute knock out woods scent. Lots going on it, but it smells fantastic. T+S is very close to being, if not already, on my \"buy whatever they make\" list.\n\nAs far as the Wolfman goes, this is probably my 10-15th shave with it, and I'm still blown away by it. It's absolutely effortless. No adjusting the blade, super efficient, and looks beautiful. I assumed there would be a performance upgrade over the entry level products I have, but it has surpassed my expectations. If you have the opportunity to scoop one up, I wouldn't hesitate.\n\n\n\n\n",

Surprisingly, I didn't have any real objections to the smell of this soap - maybe it's a more herbal, less sickly-sweet anise. Also enjoyed the menthol content.\n\nI did one pass on my neck today. Right now it feels pretty tender, BUT...I think part of my problem may be brush-burn, because my neck was feeling just fine, almost no redness before the shave, but partway thru the lather, it started to feel a little stingy again. Unfortunately, I think this has re-irritated it, but next time I will be sure to either palm lather or use my much softer Synthetic brush.\n\nI just got a little order from Van Yulay in the mail - a couple of soap samples and three 1 oz. EdTs. Based on the prices, I'm certainly not expecting any kind of fantastic performance, but this one is smelling pretty nice so far.

Both the tub and bottle are getting low. It will be a sad day when they are gone.\n\nEdit: Cleaning the linen closet I came across the AoS Aftershave Mask. Don't remember buying it but whatever. I'm going to try and use it for the next few days. Not really sure what it does. Rinsed off after my shave, applied witch hazel, let that dry then put on the mask. After a few minutes washed it off then put on the Fougere Classique. My face feels nice but it always feels nice when I use B&M products.",

This is the first of two new brushes I'll introduce before the end of the tour. I started working to have some customs done as soon as the brush tour was done, and this was the first to arrive. It's a custom from Robert Quinn at Elite Razor. It wasn't suppose to be ready for another week or so, but he had a hole in his schedule so he worked my brush in. It's a resin handle with a 28mm Elite Manchurian knot. I see now why /u/HuckleberryKing is a fan of these knots, and I'm glad to add this one into the lineup.\n\n\n\nLEVIATHAN!!!!!!!! Last B & M soap in the tour. It's definitely a fall/winter scent that stands out in the cooler weather. It's also one of the few soaps I have, that to me, almost demand having the matching splash. The same elements are in both, but each one highlights very different facets of the scent profile, and together they create something better than each one individually. The soap to me is heavier on the leather, where the splash makes the coffee and sandalwood shine. Together they also have some nice longevity. Bvlgari Black is my go-to for this one, though I also like HiM, and Chariol Pour Homme Black. I haven't picked it up yet, but according the man himself, Acca Kappa - Black Pepper and Sandalwood is a match made in heaven for Leviathan. This is not my first time with this setup, and I know the smells from these things are going to mix and mingle and be pleasant for a large part of the day today.\n\n\n\nHave a good one!\n\n\n\n**Soaps**\n\n[<< Barrister & Mann - Latha Taiga](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5rlrbl/thursday_sotd_thread_feb_02_2017/dd8dmz2/)\n\n[Castle Forbes - Lime Essential Oil >>](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5rzodw/saturday_sotd_thread_feb_04_2017/ddbloo4/)\n****\n\n**Tours**\n\n[Razor Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5lefc9/happy_new_year_sotd_thread_jan_01_2017/dbv6f4p/)\n\n[Brush Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5o322q/sunday_sotd_thread_jan_15_2017/dcgf5ud/)\n\n[Soap Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5q99m5/thursday_sotd_thread_jan_26_2017/dcxird1/)",

The scent is strong, like the few Van Yulay soaps I've tried, and heavy on the cardamom. Which is a shame because I was really excited about the cilantro part, but oh well. I have this strange feeling that each Van Yulay scent I've used all smell vaguely similar, like too similar. Its a good scent, just strange. Anyway, the performance was okay, as in not spectacular still a good shave. Post shave feel was probably the shining star with this one.\n\nLesson learned: find a cilantro scented soap. Isnt there one from sapone di Paolo?",

I love the DR Harris aftershave, so I ordered their matching shaving soap (which is a new product for them). Happy to say the scent is a match! If I had to narrow my soap / scent selections to a top 3, this would be in them.\n\nThe FaTip has a reputation for being \"aggressive.\" I could definitely full the blade throughout. Staying mindful of the razor angle (and my rushed prep) I was able to avoid incident. The razor looks great. It's plated brass, which is nice. But there are a couple of minor irritations. The plating (on the handle) has some minor imperfections. And the handle is actually pretty slippery with wet fingers. For the price, I'll survive.\n\nPleasant result in a rush. Happy Friday!",

I'd even say the Barbasol is a tad more efficient. The 37C is still a mighty fine shaver, and gets the job done without drama. Pure German efficiency - no pampering.\n\nThe Hot Barrel Rose soap's unique scent is still something I can't get enough of. If Beaudelaire is Lavanille's slutty cousin, and Czech & Speake No.88 is a fine English lady who's been gardening in her rose bush, then Hot Barrel Rose is No.88's drunk slutty cousin.

It's Vetivriday, though, so I'm keeping the Wholly Kaw train alive (for now) with *Dark Vetiver.* It's a nice, green vetiver scent. I don't get as much of the smoky, dirty vetiver out of this as I do something like L&L's *Marshlands.* Because my nose is wonked today, I'm not getting much out of it at all beyond a beautiful, green, woody vetiver blend. I can't really differentiate the individual notes, but I really enjoy the scent regardless.\n\n*La Quatrième Ville* pairs with it exactly as well as it pairs with *Réunion,* which is to say perfectly. I think /u/hawns once referred to *La Quatrième Ville* and *Réunion* as the ideal union, and I can't really deny that. However, if those two are the ideal union, then *Dark Vetiver* is *La Quatrième Ville's* mantenuta (*comare* for all you Sopranos fans out there).\n\nAnd yes, I just used an Italian word to refer to the mistress of an aftershave with a French name. I don't speak much French, but I think the appropriate term in that language would be *maîtresse.*\n\nAnyway, WEEKEND! Happy Friday, all!\n",

Pretty solid blind buy, though. Up there with my favorite artisans based on my first impression.\n\nThe lather exploded and had loads of cushion. Nice residual slickness after I rinsed my face. It doesn't seem as slick as some, but wasn't lacking and didn't adversely affect the shave. My aftershave choice dried out my skin - I've been spoiled with other stuff that has superior nourishing properties. Overall I'm impressed with the soap, though.\n\nThe scent is pretty close to Stirling Barbershop. Talc, sweetness, powdery.",

Decided to pick up their last bottle of GLS EdT while I was there. I have not figured this scent out at all. I like it for sure, but it's very difficult for me to try and pick out any notes (I guess that could be a good thing - well blended and all that). It's \"brighter\" than the description would lead me to believe.\n\nSnakebite is fun. Brought a few tears to my eyes at first (didn't shed them though, I'm a man!), and I'm still feeling some face-freeziness 10 or 15 min later. I'm thinkin it'll be amazing in the Summer, but I like it now too.",

When I get home, I need to work on my travel kit. See, I'm traveling for a conference. Last night there was this big dinner. Cool. I shave beforehand. I know something's wrong before I'm even done, and rinsing away the lather only confirms it: my face is bleeding, red, and near my mouth there is a bright red line running down my cheek.\n\nShit.\n\nI tried everything. Lots of aftershave. Cold compress. What finally worked was a combination of time and about a quarter of a bottle of Thayer's with aloe. It didn't look good at that point, but at least I wasn't embarrassed to leave my hotel room.\n\nI don't know what it was. I'm so used to the buttery smooth shaves with my slim right now. But traveling with a 3 piece razor is so much more convenient due to my 3D printed Altoids case.\n\nI'm going to be doing a lot of traveling over the next six months, so when I get home tomorrow I need to stop using the slim and start figuring out which 3 piece razor and which blade in that razor will be best.

I know it's not a finely crafted work of functional art, and it's not an heirloom piece. But it sure as hell shaves well and that ain't no shit.

Still, **CADE** is one of those products for which I feel weird not pairing the matching balm; not sure why, but oh well.\n\nIt's Saturday, everyone! It's also freezing-ass cold. I think I might go thrifting today or tomorrow. We'll see; I still have very little energy, and my eyes popped open at 6, so I'm pretty tired. For now I'm going to relax and enjoy my coffee.\n\nHave a great weekend!",

While I prefer their lavender scent, I didn't have anything else that was close to the lime, so after sampling both I decided that for now I'd pick up the lime first. The scent is of fresh cut limes; pulp, rind and skin. It has all the right elements, sweet and fruity, sharp and bitter, with that just slightly earthy edge on the rind. The scent really blooms as it's lathered, and made me want to go make up some brunch margaritas. The consistancy is somewhere between a softer cream, like TOBS and a soft artisan soap, which makes loading out of the full tub a little odd. Too firm to just dip the tips, but too soft to do a normal swirl. I'm not sure how anyone else does it, but I do about 5 or 6 swirls on the top of the cream, with about 1/3 of the normal pressure I use on a soap. Once loaded, it quickly and easily builds an excellent lather, that is very slick and has just the right amount of cushion. The post-shave is also good, or at least it's not drying, but not as good to me as some of the amazing post-shaves coming from some of the artisans. Pairing for this could go in a ton of directions. It's not a complex scent. Anything citrus based will do, but my choice for this one has become the Lyric Man, which opens with hints of lime and bergamont, so the Castle Forbes flows nicely into it.\n\n\n\nHave a good one!\n\n\n\n**Soaps**\n\n[<< Barrister & Mann - Leviathan](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5rswbd/friday_sotd_thread_feb_03_2017/dd9zx69/)\n\n[Catie's Bubbles - Connecticut Shade >>](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5sd7xv/monday_sotd_thread_feb_06_2017/ddefd1d/)\n****\n\n**Tours**\n\n[Razor Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5lefc9/happy_new_year_sotd_thread_jan_01_2017/dbv6f4p/)\n\n[Brush Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5o322q/sunday_sotd_thread_jan_15_2017/dcgf5ud/)\n\n[Soap Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5q99m5/thursday_sotd_thread_jan_26_2017/dcxird1/)",

I'm not sure if it was the milder Derby blade or just the fact I was paying more attention to angle than last time I used the slant, but I have almost no irritation - a little bit on my neck from brush burn (mostly), but neither of the alcohol-based things I put on my face really stung at all.\n\nI really love Fine's aftershaves. They're so simple, but just work so well and smell so good. The sandalwood one doesn't seem to have quite the intense projection that some of their cologne-types do, but it is still a really pleasant and warm scent.\n\nI never would've thought it, but Stirling made an anise product I really enjoy. I was half thinking I would have to just throw this one away after smelling it or using it once, but now I'm pretty darn sure I'll burn my way through the whole sample, enjoying every shave with it.",

Fixing something around the house and I had the dig some wood out and I slipped. My fault as I should have been more aware of where my hand was. Not too bad. A few inch long slice but one part is fileted a little. Good thing they are that sharp because it closed up pretty quick. Some liquid skin and I was good to go.",

Shout out to /u/drivenlegend for turning me this amazing brush. I had a vague idea of what I wanted which was something two-tone with clear acrylic. I PM'ed our good friend with this and we both picked each other's brains. Towards the end I trusted everything over to him. He made sure I was happy with throughout the process. The handle is modeled after the [zenith brush](http://i.ebayimg.com/images/g/g0sAAOSwKfVXJtVW/s-l300.jpg). Thanks again friend.\nAfter the shave I used a small amount of aftershave so that it would compliment the Passiflora rather than overwhelm everything else. The end result is a sweet but cologney scent that will last me most of the day.\nHappy shaving everyone! :)",

I have the Stainless model in version 1 as well. I wasn't terribly impressed with the aluminum version, but that could be because of blade choice. I'll try a pro super next.\n\nI used this brush, Declaration Brushworks Franklin #1, that I received in November of 2016. Definitely purchased Franklin #1 **AFTER** April 2016. To my knowledge it was the first official DBW handle and knot. It's an amazing brush, and *still* hasn't broken in fully after about 20-25 shaves.\n\nAs a side note, if you're going to scam people, and get caught doing it, don't make up bullshit stories when you get busted. That's been burning my ass all week. I wasn't scammed, but it still makes me angry to think about it. Some of the people in this hobby are absolute shit.",

I might have used a bit too much water, but it eventually lathered like a champ.\n\nVery slick and provided good cushion. Performance is very similar to Stirling imo.\n\nThe scent is very nice and quite similar to the real thing. My wife said it smelled like \"sexy man\" and the fact she reacted to it at all is good. She's usually pretty indifferent to my shave supplies, but she enjoys this soap, which is an added bonus for me. I paired it with Executive Man since it was similar in being a cologne type scent.\n\nMy shave was WAY off today. I went first pass with a straight and all was well until I whipped out my Sheraton. That razor has always been a bit scrapey to me, so I threw in a couple shims hoping for something different. Well, it was different alright. I butchered my chin and neck. I really want to like the Sheraton, but I'm beginning to think it's not for me. Funny enough, I should have just stuck with the straight and I would've had less blood loss.",

This is a really nice scent. It is quite a bit sweeter than I expected, vanilla mostly to me. The different notes seemed to line up with GLS (Thanks trythatsoap.com !). I think the pairing works out really well. I'm going to try this with Bon Vivant too but I think GLS is going to be my go-to post shave product with this soap.",

As a result, I decided that the slim is going to have to go - it doesn't give me as good shaves as my techs or the Calypso and I haven't been using as often anymore. I think I've kept it for so long because it was my first vintage and adjustable.. Plus the rhodium looks cool. I'm sure if I really wanted it back, I can pick one up down the line and if no one bites, I'm totally fine keeping it for now. This is my last shave with it before cleaning it up and posting it for sale.\n\nAnyway, I won this toner from a giveaway Cap was doing on a live steam and it's fucking *gooood*. I don't normally like sandalwood scents, but /u/hawns knocked it out of the park with this one. I think the powdery aspect it has sweetens and rounds it out to make it more enjoyable for me.. Or maybe I'm bullshitting and grew to love sandalwood.. Who knows? Now to figure out what other soaps go well with this..",

It's light in color, white or nearly white. Consistency is soft, very similar to Dr. Jon's vol1, and it loads extremely quickly. It explodes into a quality lather very quickly and trickling in water only improves it - I didn't add enough to break it so not sure yet how thirsty it is. Slickness is fantastic, my NEW didn't skip, stutter or hesitate; it slid right along, effortlessly removing hair. Two passes and a small touchup later yielded a BBS shave. For the touchup, I just wet my fingers and moistened the area that I needed to reshave; the soap had plenty of residual slickness so I didn't need to add lather. Post shave feel is amazing! I had no dryness (happens to me in winter) and my skin felt very soft so no post was necessary. I'm getting over a nasty cold so my nose isn't the best but I could smell some lavender from the soap and ten minutes after shaving and rinsing off, my girlfriend could still smell it on me.\n\nWhile this is still my first use, I'm very comfortable saying that if he starts making these soaps and selling them, I'd buy them without a second thought and kick some of the stuff in my den to the curb.\n\nThank you for the opportunity /u/Fahrenheit915!",

I would have done it yesterday, but **CADE**. Sorry, bud.\n\nThe scent notes in this soap are vanilla, amber, sandalwood and cedarwood. It's very vanilla-forward, but I I can definitely get the amber mixed with that, and hints of the cedarwood come through once it's lathered. I can't find the sandalwood in it, but my nose is still a bit wonky so that could be the reason. *Spellbound Woods* is a little sweeter than what I normally go for, but it's still a very nice, mellow scent that I quite enjoyed shaving with.\n\nThe soap performs really well. I loaded with too wet a brush and ended up with enough lather for my entire neighborhood, but building it was very easy. Because of my wet load, I can't really speak to the thirstiness that others had reported with it. I'll try it again later this week and see if I can dial that down a bit. It has good slickness and residual slickness, and a very nice post-shave feel. I could definitely see this being a permanent part of my den.\n\n*Lavanille* is a nice pairing for it. The sweetness of the vanilla in the soap meshes nicely with the *Mousse de Saxe,* exaltolide and the lavender, as well as lining up with the vanilla. The two cedar notes line up as well. The overall effect is a nice darkening of the original sweetness, which is not necessarily something I'd want if I were shaving before bed, but works nicely in the morning or early evening.\n\nHappy Sunday, everyone! Enjoy your shaves!",

Should be interesting ;-)\n\nBoth razors used the same blade being swapped between razors.\n\n**Efficiency:** The Aristocrat wins here, but not by as much as you would think. They were dead even on the WTG pass. When they're even after 1, I go straight to ATG, which tends to magnify the differences. The Aristocrat did a little better here on efficiency.\n\n**Smoothness:** This surprised me. The Blue Tip was noticeably smoother on all passes. Shocked actually.\n\n**Ease of Shave:** As expected, the Blue Tip wins here, and it wasn't even close. The Aristocrat feels downright clunky because of the extra weight.\n\n**Overall Experience:** The Blue Tip wins handily. It's perfectly balanced, weighs next to nothing compared to the Aristocrat so it feels like an extension of my hand rather than holding a ball-peen hammer. It's smoother without sacrificing much in terms of efficiency. The results may be completely different with a new sharp blade rather than my senior 45-shave blade, but since I shave mostly with \"dull\" blades, any other results are meaningless to me.",

A well blended scent which remains decently strong during the lather. Good slickness as well and extremely easy to lather.\n\nThe Barrister's Reserve aftershave felt pretty great on my skin - I was sort of thinking the long ingredient list would give it a bit of a heavy feel, but I did not find that to be the case. Good menthol content and a nice and clean scent.\n\nDid three passes, maybe should have stuck with two, as I felt some irritation after the shave. A few hours later I'm not feeling too much though.",

      "body": "Prep: Warm Shower\nBrush: Muhle Vivo Black Synthetic\nRazor: Feather AS-D2\nSoap: Fierce by u/Fahrenheit915\nPost: Chatillon Lux Delor de Treget Aftershave\n\nI was honored to acquire some soap from u/Fahrenheit915 and gave it a shot tonight for the first time. The scent is the ubiquitous Fierce cologne from Abercrombie & Fitch and it's spot on. If you've ever walked within 50 feet of an A&F store at the mall, you know the scent. I've gotta admit while I hate almost everything about A&F and would never step foot in their stores, their store/cologne scent is almost a guilty pleasure of mine, as juvenile smelling as it is. Off the dry puck the strength is about an 8 or 9, but in the lather I would say 6 or 7. It's probably the right balance for most people, but could be stronger (to the point of being obnoxious) for those who want to feel like they're shaving inside an A&F store. I loaded for about 10-15 seconds, then after a minute or two of face lathering and adding water 4 or 5 times to the brush, the lather exploded. Very rich, dense, shiny yogurty lather. Performance was great, I can't point to any glaring weaknesses. The protection was there - no nicks or irritation - and my face felt nourished afterwards. FWIW I did a quick 2 pass shave during halftime of the game. Well done u/Fahrenheit915, my first impression is that this soap can compete with just about anything out there and I would be proud to have made it.\n\nFor the A/S not much to say that hasn't been said; the scent is probably a bit out of season but I just got it on clearance and wanted to try it out ;p It's a great light citrus scent that is fresh, sweet, and subtle yet not hiding, and just the perfect amount of menthol for me - something along the lines of Floid Blue. It will definitely be a go to for me on any 90+ degree day.",

This is by far the most soap I've ever crammed onto a brush before and when I finally got enough water into it I had enough lather to shave several times. This is some seriously good product though and I'll definitely be revisiting it after I work through some other stuff.\n\nAlso congrats to u/dendj55 and you other Patriot fans. That was as good of a game as any neutral fan could have hoped for, super fun to watch.",

After that got done, went back to bed, and dozed till about 7:30. Got in the shower, and decided that if I was going to use LBdS I would actually get sick, so I switched to something a little less sweet. That that seems to be doing well.

I loathe Proraso green soap, but I have the opposite opinion of the classic green aftershave. Just a really nice scent.\n\nI have no idea how long this blade will last, but it is right at the top as my favorite. Flip a coin between this and Polsilver SI. My problem is my skin on my neck will start with red spots once a blade loses its utmost sharpness. I tend to go with more aggressive razors since it takes less passes to accomplish my intended goal. The blades still cut well, but once that \"rash\" - for lack of a better term - starts, I bin the blade. We will see. Great Monday shaves to all.\n",

So far, it has 22 shaves on it, and shows no signs of quitting. The last 4 shaves on it have been identical, which is a good sign in my experience. If it starts getting less comfortable or efficient, I'll make note of that (not that I wouldn't regardless).\n\nHappy Monday, everyone! Enjoy your shaves.",

Two days growth, so I needed a full three passes, from a soap that on my first two uses burned my face. For a bit I really considered avoiding this soap on the tour, but I pushed through. I'm glad I did, as today there was no reaction to the soap. Maybe a mild tingle by the end of three passes, but if so, it was so mild that I couldn't tell if it was real or psychosomatic. The CB loads and laters up really easily, and creates a nice, slick lather. The fragrance on this one is also fantastic, a really good tobacco vanilla scent, very deep and rich. I really like matching it with the classic Brut fougère. For some reason I really like the pairing of those two with The One, although it would go really well with D&G Pour Homme, Versace Dreamer, CK One Shock or other of a myriad of tobacco and fougère frags.\n\n\n\nHave a good one!\n\n\n\n**Soaps**\n\n[<< Castle Forbes - Essential Lime Oil](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5rzodw/saturday_sotd_thread_feb_04_2017/ddbloo4/)\n\n[Chiseled Face Groomatorium - Ghost Town Barber >>](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5skdrs/tuesday_sotd_thread_feb_07_2017/ddg2u0o/)\n****\n\n**Tours**\n\n[Razor Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5lefc9/happy_new_year_sotd_thread_jan_01_2017/dbv6f4p/)\n\n[Brush Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5o322q/sunday_sotd_thread_jan_15_2017/dcgf5ud/)\n\n[Soap Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5q99m5/thursday_sotd_thread_jan_26_2017/dcxird1/)",

If you grab right by the head it's a decent balance. Brush was cool to use. Handle's the perfect size really. It's like a small polo, but the knot is decently sized. The old best badger is kinda scritchy but I'm gonna have that changed out for something nicer. Probably Manchurian unless Mark can pull some SiLVERTiP out of a badger butt.\n",

Had terrible timing though. My dad was exhausted from PT, sitting up for hours, etc. He's doing a lot better and thanks for all the warm wishes from this community.\n\nToday's shave was a quick one. I had mixed feelings about this brush initially regarding the density and backbone, but I'm starting to like it. It has great flow-through and the initial slight scritchiness is completely faded. It's not as much backbone as I was expecting from a M&F Finest knot, but it works perfectly for face lathering.",

Having shaved with it now, it's certainly smooth, effortless.\n\nThe knot is so dense, I'm looking forward to it loosing up a little.

I gotta say, this was my first go with a slant (and my first go with an über light razor) and it wasn't a super great experience. I'm sure my technique was somewhat to blame, but my shave wasn't particularly smooth, clean, or comfortable. I'll try this razor again in a few days, but in the meantime it has certainly helped me appreciate my slim that much more.",

Had to celebrate with some MFing ROAM. I did give myself a tiny little nick with the duck, the first time it has tasted my blood. Still the thing is so sharp, and the nick was so little, a bit of styptic and I couldn't see any lines or marks after the shave.\n\nAnd it sure looks like I might have a snow day tomorrow!",

Poor little girl was traumatized in her youth after being abused in a puppy mill, so I'm probably overly worried and overprotective, but I'm assuming that, since it got cold last night, she probably said fuck it and let someone take her in. She's super cute and that probably worked in her favor.\n\nSo I cleaned up today with the goal of getting in a positive mindset and decided a Tabac(co) Tuesday was in order. It was a nice one.

If it were a Rapira Platinum Lux, it'd be in the blade bank already. I like the new Gillette Platinum blades better than Polsilver SI. I didn't know that was even possible.\n\nStay smooth.",

She was a little weirdo and not the easiest to get into after being abused early in life, a very complex personality. So a complex, somewhat offensive scent (sometimes described as wet dog) from Boston seemed appropriate. It's nice to have closure after a few days of searching and fearing the worst. Luckily she didn't suffer.\n\nAs Kurt Vonnegut said, \"[So it goes.](http://cdn.quotesgram.com/img/86/61/1963810834-s7jdedP.jpg)\" He also said, \"[Everything was beautiful and nothing hurt.](https://thestartofallthings.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/everything-was-beautiful-and-nothing-hurt.png)\"\n\nEdit: I should point out that I understand the irony of the latter quote, it's just that the life of Billy Pilgrim seems to be a nice parallel for the life of an abused rescue dog. It was no WWII, but you know.",

The Unconditional surrender doesn't match at all, but I just picked it up and wanted to try it. It's ok, but not my favorite.\n\n\n\n\n",

He's better, but still running a bit of a temp. I'm wiped out.\n\nAfter a conversation about pairings with *Latha Original* during Will's AMA, I decided to grab a sample of Fine's *American Blend* and try the pairing (thanks, /u/darkfox45). It's an odd scent. It's very familiar, but I can't quite place it. It reminds me a bit of Stirling's *Clubman* scent, but different. I don't dislike it, but I don't really quite like it, either. However, it does pair decently with *Latha Original,* so even if I don't buy a full bottle, I'll definitely keep using the sample. I'm going to try Stirling *Clubman* with *Latha Original* as well, the next time I use it.\n\nWill's *Latha* line is so goddamn good. I always forget how well it performs in between uses, and I don't understand how. If I were giving odds for the March Madness soaps, I'd place good ones on *Latha Lavanda* to win.\n\nWhile grabbing the *American Blend* sample, I also decided to splurge on a new brush. Enter the Omega 40033. Thanks, /u/i_like_a_clean_bowl, for the recommendation. It's a good brush. A li'l scritchy on first use, but it feels like it'll break in nicely. Time to hunt down some o-rings for the handle.\n\nHappy Thursday, everyone.\n\n\n\n-----\n**EDIT:** *Formatting.*",

Finally settled in here in sweet Afghanistan and overall it's not terrible but definitely more restrictive than my time in Jordan last Oct-Apr. So in Jordan we were allowed to wear civilian clothes after work and allowed other liberties, however here it's uniform at all times unless you're going to the gym then authorized PT uniform and none of the liberties in Jordan.\n\nI'm very happy to have brought Roam with because damnit it's awesome. A great shave, decent food and well wishes from my wife, not much to complain about.\n\nOh and I never suspected this area to get nearly as much snow as it does. Seriously surprising.\n\nHave a great day everyone.",

This has been my shave combo the last two weeks. The Latha was a very generous sample container bonus from B&M on my last order, and also brought about 1oz of Speick for variety. A few 1/2 oz sample vials for aftershave splashes were perfect travel size, and the variety was nice. The Weber / Polsilver combo was very smooth and only used one blade. And who doesn't like a premium badger even on vacation?! Dried it out a full day before packing in a pill tube and no worries. All around great shaves for hitting the slopes and nights on the town.",

That lasted until I started to load the brush and instantly remembered how good this soap is.\n\nEven with this new boar, the soap loads quickly and easily. Adding just a little water to the mostly dry brush (dipped the tips in water for a few seconds instead of soaking) and it was ready to lather. This brush still craves water and usually refuses to release a decent lather (I had to resort to a second brush a few shaves ago) but I was able to make a high quality lather within a few minutes. I honestly don't believe that the brush reached a turning point that fast and suspect the soap's quality there.\n\nAfter I had my head lathered, I proceeded with the Schick I2. This is my second use of this razor and the first time was pretty rough (different software). This time, I had a very smooth pass with no issues. Once again, I wet a finger and moistened a spot on my head to see how the residual slickness of the soap was and found it to be wonderful; touchups would NOT require more lather, just a few drops of water.\n\nSeeing how things were going so well and I still had some soap hiding in the brush, I prepped for a second pass and squeezed the remaining lather out of the brush and rubbed it on with my hand. ATG pass had no problems at all, even with the thin remaining lather.\n\nRinsing off my head, I was once again impressed at how much residual slickness this soap has. I wouldn't recommend trying it but I suspect I could get away with one pass, wetting the area and making another pass fairly easily based on how slick the soap leaves my skin.\n\nNo nicks, no cuts, no irritation, just an excellent shave with this impressive soap.",

It seems to have a ton of lather on it when I'm loading and lathering the first pass, but there's barely anything left by the time I get to the second. Am I just not loading enough to begin with, or is something happening to the lather while it's sitting?",

We got a solid 12-15 inches of snow. This is my second shave with the Baby Smooth and it was an extremely easy razor to figure out the correct angle and pressure. I just need to find the right blade for it. Might hit up Tryablade.com for another couple top 10 samplers.\n",

A day in which I get to pack 2 missed days worth of work (plus whatever happens today) into one, then get groceries, then clean my house, then hang with my kiddo for the weekend. You know, regular life stuff.\n\nI added some o-rings to the handle of my Omega 40033, and just like that it's now twice the brush it was before (and it was good before). This is a seriously great little brush, now. If anyone's interested in trying out a boar brush, but doesn't want to lay out a ton of cash up front, I can't recommend this one highly enough. $7 USD is maybe the cheapest I've ever seen any brush whatsoever, let alone one that performs this well.\n\nThe Astra is still running with a tailwind. Easy, smooth shave today. Glad something went right first thing this morning.\n\nHope everyone has a good weekend.",

I probably could have done a 10 pass shave and still have no irritation. It was unbelievable. The Cade pairing with LQV really worked well together too. So now I have to decide how to spend my shave budget for the week. I missed out on purchasing the MdC Rose when it came out, and I found a retailer that has a jar. Or should I buy another jar or two of the Cade?",

The angle was a little different than I'm used to, but it was easy to find.\n\nSeeming like this was a good random purchase so far, but more shaves will really tell.",

R. Harris - *Windsor*\n* **Splash**: Fine Accountrements - *L'Orange Noir*\n* **Balm**: Eucerin - *Original Healing Rich Creme*\n* **Frag**: Franck Olivier - *Black Touch*\n\n****\n\n\n\nOh the relief of an almost full night's sleep in your own bed, and a real shower and shave. Mom's home and doing well, and baby is on track to get released hopefully soon. It's a real treat to sit down and write out a SOTD again.\n\n\n\nI have to admit, aside from the Van der Hagen puck I bought when I was first starting, this was my first real lather with triple milled soap. Was concerned I would have difficulties, but had no problems lathering the Windsor up. I see why D.R. Harris still has a lot of love after so many years producing shaving soaps. With no effort, I whipped up a lather that was exactly the right consistency, not airy, and tons of that shimmer that says \"I'm hydrated and ready to go\". It was nice and slick, and had enough body to provide an excellent cushion. The biggest downside for me was probably that residual slickness and post shave were not quite as good as I get from some of the really good artisans, but they weren't non-existent, just merely good rather than excellent. The scent on the Windsor is also quite pleasant to me. A fairly clean and lightly woody citrus and vetiver combination, quite reminiscent of Terre d'Hermes, but maybe a touch less broody. It would pair well with most vetivers. Encre Noir, Lalique Pour Homme, Terre d'Hermes, etc, but I thought the vetiver it most closely resembled was the Black Touch. The citrus shared a similar sour note, and the vetivers were similarly woody.\n\n\n\nHave a good one!\n\n\n\n**Soaps**\n\n[<< Chiseled Face Groomatorium - Sherlock](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5syy87/thursday_sotd_thread_feb_09_2017/ddjteq9/)\n\n[Dapper Dragon - Lavender Lizard >>](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5tkj95/sunday_sotd_thread_feb_12_2017/ddnfpqp/)\n****\n\n**Tours**\n\n[Razor Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5lefc9/happy_new_year_sotd_thread_jan_01_2017/dbv6f4p/)\n\n[Brush Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5o322q/sunday_sotd_thread_jan_15_2017/dcgf5ud/)\n\n[Soap Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5q99m5/thursday_sotd_thread_jan_26_2017/dcxird1/)",

I thought I had some sensitivity to this scent, but I think it was just brush or razor burn in the past :). I didn't notice any uncomfortableness until the third pass...so probably mild razor burn.

This came [in a lot](http://i.imgur.com/CbxtitQ.jpg) with the blue handled Lady Gillette I wanted. It cleaned up really well, not mint, but VG+ for sure.\n\nOf particular note is that this razor has the lowest profile head of any TTO that I own. It's noticeably less bulky than the previous flare-tip Super Speeds, and a whole lot thinner than the Fatboy. I guess Gillette was starting to figure out that less and less people were wearing mustaches and needed something thinner to get under low flying noses like yours truly.\n\nThe shave was somewhat underwhelming. I found the razor even milder than the Blue Tip, on par with the oval-slot Tech, yet for some reason I can't pinpoint, the shave was not as satisfying. Disappointing because the weight, balance, and overall feel in the hand is perfect. It's a zippy little razor for a TTO though.\n\nOff to shovel the walkway and get the fleet out of the driveway before the snow removal guy passes.",

Despite being only my second shave with the razor, I can say with a good amount of confidence that it's the best (for me) out of the three razors I've tried. It's gentle yet efficient - got to almost BBS with just two passes today, and I have never felt this little irritation post-shave as I do today.\n\nI didn't like the scent on Proraso Blue when I first smelled it - it sort of reminded me of wet dog. I think that is a bit of a musky note which has grown on me since.\n\nI'm trying a sample of Jaipur and thought it would pair decently well with the Santal Absolut. This fragrance is very nice smelling, but I'm not sure I like how sweet it is - I'll have to get the lady's opinion tonight.\n\nHope everybody has/had as good a shave as I did today.",

Based on some very negative comments I've read in the past, I expected it to be very musky and possibly hard to like. Definitely not my experience. I can't explain the smell quite yet but holy balls it smells good. I'm so glad I jumped on it and bought some. I'm not sure which scent it's elbowed out of my top five yet but one of them just took a fall.",

Their performance is on par with any vegan formula I've ever used, and most of the tallow ones as well. Check him out if you haven't already; you won't be disappointed.\n\n28 shaves on the Astra (in the NEW). Still rockin'. Honestly, I'm not really surprised. If I get 50 out of it, then that'll be something to talk about.\n\n*Colonia Balsamica* pairs nicely with *Agrume.* The citrus and basil notes mesh well together, and give the rest of the splash's bouquet a nice punch up.\n\nHave a good Sunday, all.",

It took me a little longer than usual to dial in the lather, because I'm a small brush guy. This brush seems huge to me and I underloaded. Once I got that corrected all was well. I understand that the competition is fierce among the top artisans and the feeling that tweaking formulas is crucial to continued success, but this discontinued Black Label stuff is such a good product as is. No tweaking needed. Too bad it's not around anymore. No antiquing for me today. Chores await.",

The Dapper Dragon soaps never disappoint me. They lather easily and provide a good slickness and post-shave feel. This one is my current go-to soap when I want lavender. It's a litte spicy from the black pepper, but the lavender leans towards the sweeter floral end of the lavender spectrum, with little of the sharp camphorous edge in some varieties that can be herbal and almost minty. Finding a pairing for this is quite easy, as anything lavender centric will do, and in the world of men's fragrance, you can't trip without falling into dozens of them. Today though, my mood was for something beautifully simplistic that was also in that sweet lavender family, which from my understanding is the lesser used variety. Pour un Homme de Caron fits this perfectly. A syrupy sweet lavender with a warm and creamy vanilla sitting on top of other things I could only say are warm and lightly dry and spicy.\n\n\n\nHave a good one!\n\n\n\n**Soaps**\n\n[<< D. R.

Not an excellent shave, but not a bad one either. I'm not giving up on this blade longevity test just yet. Part of this shave was with a SR too, so I'm going to do a fullblown DE shave with it before giving up.\n\nThis was also my first encounter with Night Music. As of right now, I don't know what to think. I love the vanilla and it's not quite as musky as some had described it, but I'm not a huge fan right off the puck or out of the bottle. Where this one really sings is during the lather and after application of the a/s. About 5 minutes after applying the a/s I got a cologne-like vanilla that was really nice. My wife enjoyed it as well, as extracurricular activities occurred afterwards. The longevity seems to be quite good as well, and the scent only gets better throughout the day. It's a keeper for sure. I'm going to roll with it for the next few days before setting it somewhere in my rotation.",

Bad choice. I skipped the weekly mustache and goatee shave yesterday, so I decided to tackle it today. This is the only time soap gets on my lips and Roam tastes horrible ;-)\n\nSomeone said yesterday that the electric razor is the right tool for the job when mowing down at least a week of growth. I think almost any razor is the right tool, and today I used the mildest SE I own, the Featherweight, and it got the job done without tugging or irritation. It was a gradual growth removal over three passes rather than removing everything in one pass (which I never shoot for). I still say the Featherweight handle makes the razor feel incredibly injector-like.\n\nMore snow on the way today and tomorrow - they're calling for 15-25 cm, so based on their acute predictive skills, we'll either get 10 cm or 30 cm.",

I understand the divisiveness. That musk is a love or hate. My initial smell of the soap was a solid \"no\", but it's growing on me a little. The AS is more more vanilla heavy, which I enjoy. The EdT is a whole other story. I really love the EdT. In addition to the standard Vanilla, Musk, Iris, Bergamot, and Strawberry, it also has some Ylang Ylang and Amber. Between this and SMdF, I fear there is justification to allow products to have different scent profiles in TTS. Ugh.\n\n\n\n\n",

It's very scrubby with circular motions and has a nice wall-o'-badger feel with painting strokes. I'm guessing it's from around 2012-2013, but not entirely sure.\n\nI tried something a little different today and used a Derby in this razor. I got them for free with the Razorock Baby Smooth and thought the mild blade with a semi-aggressive razor would be a good fit. The shave was pretty good. I got some very minor irritation; probably from too much pressure if I had to guess.\n\nIf you miss Baker Street I'd highly recommend you pick up the one from Stirling. The scent is stronger, but it's dead-on with the old scent. As usual their soap makes a slick, protective lather :).",

And, I went to Terminal 21 mall per /u/whollykaw recommendation.\n\nThis place is HUGE. Cool themes for each floor. Usually I don't like malls too much but it was fun to walk around this mall for a few hours. Also since it was next door, I checked out Soi cowboy. Though it's boring AF in the afternoon.\n\nI had thought about going to see the temples today but don't have enough time for that coz of a 4pm meeting. I will save that for Saturday. Laterz!",

As such, I picked a nice floral scent pairing this morning. We really haven't even gotten much of a winter here, this year, but I'm ready for sunshine and warmth.\n\n*Velvet* and *Catalan's Prairie* pair nearly as well as *Pantie Dropper* and *Catalan's Prairie,* which is fitting, because I like *Velvet* nearly as much as *Pantie Dropper.* *Velvet* is a great, light, warm kind of scent. I love florals, but violets are my absolute favorite among them. It's too bad every violet blend I've used gets discontinued; makes me not want to look for others to avoid them getting the axe as well.\n\n/u/MrAdamLerner, I'm not sure how often you want us to check in for the longevity challenge, but this Astra is at 29 shaves and shows zero signs of slowing down, let alone stopping. Well, that's not correct. it's shown one sign of slowing down so far: It now requires touch-ups on a couple areas of my face for a BBS shave, rather than simply delivering it in 2 passes. However, that's been going on for 11 shaves now, and each of those shaves has been identical, so it's holding steady at this time.\n\nAnyway, time to wake my kiddo and get the day rolling. Happy Monday, all.",

I had a couple of scratches on my face (not sure where I got them, they weren't there when I went to bed but were there when I woke up) and was worried about nicks and weepers in that area, but the blade just skipped right over. The blade, while smooth before, had the tendency to give me a weeper or two. This time, no weepers. So far I'm pretty much of the opinion that the new Gillette Platinum are even better than the old Polsilver SI that they replaced. I'm just a little salty about the price increase, but really, blades are not the expensive part of the hobby.",

It's a quite nice orange, sandalwood and musk scent. Performance today was great, just like yesterday. Bonus today is that I have the matching scale polish to go with the soap. I love everything about the scale polish except the menthol level. I love the cooling effect that eventually settles in, but for about 10 minutes it feels like my face is on fire, and it gets fairly red. My skin just is not a fan of the menthol. I've paired this before with Givenchy's Xeryus Rouge, which has orange, sandalwood and musk in it's profile, completely overlapping the Ouroboros. Anything sweet and woody, or sandalwood heavy should work well though. Today though I went with Graphite from Montana. I got a sample in a generous package from /u/HuckleberryKing, and was waiting for something to pair with it. Since it has a sandalwood element, I thought today was a good chance to give it a spin, and they seem to play very well together.\n\n\n\nHave a good one!\n\n\n\n**Soaps**\n\n[<< Dapper Dragon - Lavender Lizard](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5tkj95/sunday_sotd_thread_feb_12_2017/ddnfpqp/)\n\n[Dr. Jon's - Black Label >>](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5tz740/tuesday_sotd_thread_feb_14_2017/ddqcmxu/)\n****\n\n**Tours**\n\n[Razor Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5lefc9/happy_new_year_sotd_thread_jan_01_2017/dbv6f4p/)\n\n[Brush Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5o322q/sunday_sotd_thread_jan_15_2017/dcgf5ud/)\n\n[Soap Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5q99m5/thursday_sotd_thread_jan_26_2017/dcxird1/)\n",

Got it cheap because it was jammed open, but could never get is closed so I never used it. I finally hit paydirt last week and found the problem. The spring that holds the back end in was broken, and I was sure that was the problem - a bit of the spring was stuck in there jamming up the mechanism. I finally found a pic of what that spring looks like on eBay of all places and all the pieces were present and accounted for. Dang.\n\nI was going to wave the white flag, but decided to take the entire thing apart and risk something going sproing and never being able to put it back together. Bingo - I found the problem. I fished out a horribly mangled injector blade that had actually broken into 3 pieces, and one of them was bent into a half-moon shape. Either the previous owner or the Seller tried *really hard* to get the blade to eject when it jammed inside. The whole thing now works smooth like buttah. The only downside of the broken spring is that the bottom slide used to load a blade carrier is no longer captive and can slide out if pulled too far.\n\nHow does it shave? Exactly like the Type B1 and Type C1 ... absolutely no difference. Still the smoothest razor I own, with absolutely no blade feel or sensation of cutting. I would never recommend this to a novice shaver because the lack of feedback makes it hard to find and maintain the angle. Once you develop the touch for this razor, very few razors come close in the comfort department.",

Maybe it's the blade, or maybe it's that the Baby Smooth made me feel too confident, but my neck doesn't feel great (and even worse, there's still a good bit of hair on it). After reading a few posts on here or wicked edge about problems shaving the neck, I decided to attempt the J-hook technique on a couple spots, and I'm thinking that may have contributed. My face is great, but shaving my neck is still proving to be very frustrating.\n\nDoes anybody else have a lot of trouble with the part of their neck to either side of the adam's apple? My hair there grows kind of up and horizontal, towards my ears. It also lays very flat, so wtg and xtg passes don't seem to catch a whole lot of it.",

Unbelievable stuff, so so good. I was on a stupid hiatus last year when it came out and spent all year regretting it. Could not miss out this time. Having used it I may well have to take the plunge and get the splash and EDT from Italian Barber and get it sent to my parents in the UK. Sure, I won't get to use it till I visit at Christmas but that will be a sweet moment. Have a good one everyone",

Today's shave seems to have gone quite smoothly - I feel no irritation and my face is really smooth - even made progress on knocking down all the stubborn long hairs on my neck.\n\nHope everyone has a good shave today!",

I can tell the blade has lost some of its cutting power, but it hasn't caused irritation on my neck, so I am keeping on. I will try and take a picture of the blade and zoom in to see if it is starting to oxidize on the edge or just a discoloration. Actually don't know how the hell I will be able to tell.\n\nHere is a [link to 28mm fauxmere brush](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0Bx62Nre2N1zdLTVtZjdkUXpnaEk?usp=sharing) It doesn't look like the shop is up on Etsy anymore. Oh well, he did a fantastic job on this brush and it is a big bastard compared to my Nathan Clark handle with the AMACK Game Changer that /u/drivenlegend put in for me. The brush has zero spring in it and is the scrubbiest synthetic brush I have (if synthetics can even have scrub). This thing will lather anything you throw at it. Great brush, IMHO.

This is the only soap I bloom and since the well used puck was really dried out, I soaked it overnight. I poured off the bloom water and went to it. It's never going to make a top quality lather like a really good soap, but I'm always amazed at its slickness. It likes water, a lot of it. Most problems with lack of slickness can be helped with more water. And it just happened to be my 40th shave on this Polsilver. I tend to use WMS on milestone shaves, but this one was unintentional. The blade still has life in it. Tuesday awaits.\n\nEdit: wording.",

Went with Iliahi Ridge since I preferred that scent over NM. This soap is fantastic. Easy to load, extremely slick and great post shave feel. Definitely a winner in my book. Looking forward to his next releases. Have a great shave everyone!",

My problem is that in the past I've had some performance trouble with this soap. I'm fully willing to accept it's something with my lather building technique. The cushion/protection was fine, as was the post-shave. The lather looks good, it just didn't have the slickness I get out of other soaps. I think I wasn't getting the hydration right or something. I tried to go more slowly today, and pushed it gently until I could feel the lather break from foamy/pasty, into a smooth creamy glide. It was much better today than in my previous attempts with it. Still not as slick as some other artistan soaps, but much better, and even before it wasn't terrible, just not quite as good. I think it may just be a little fussy about building, and I have the feeling that if I used it for a week straight it could be dialed in nicely. In terms of pairing, I think this would go well with most fougères, particularly anything with tobacco included. D & G Pour Homme or The One would both work well. CK One Shock would probably work just fine. Today though, I went with what I always pick for the Black Label, which is Versace's Dreamer. These two just pair and complement each other very well, and I love the combination.\n\n\n\n#####💖 💐 💕 🌸 💖 💐 💕 🌸 Happy Valentine's Day! 💖 💐 💕 🌸 💖 💐 💕 🌸\n\n\n\n**Soaps**\n\n[<< Dapper Dragon - Ouroboros](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5trxgj/monday_sotd_thread_feb_13_2017/ddor7fv/)\n\n[Henri et Victoria - La Poire Française >>](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5u6dly/wednesday_sotd_thread_feb_15_2017/ddrvx6i/)\n****\n\n**Tours**\n\n[Razor Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5lefc9/happy_new_year_sotd_thread_jan_01_2017/dbv6f4p/)\n\n[Brush Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5o322q/sunday_sotd_thread_jan_15_2017/dcgf5ud/)\n\n[Soap Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5q99m5/thursday_sotd_thread_jan_26_2017/dcxird1/)",

This is proving much more difficult than I anticipated. I do like the scent, and I never have any problems with the performance of the white label base, but I'm getting bored with the soap and I'm really wanting to go back to using a new soap every day. Thankfully, that time is on its way! A couple days ago my puck got the white ring of death in the middle and it has been expanding ever since. Before too long I'll be back to the old rotation again!",

The musk is very interesting too though one of them smells a little too chemically to my nose right off the bat. Made the mistake of loading my brush with too much water and then trying to shake it out getting night music all over my counter and towel lol. Now that everything is drying down the musk is starting to settle down nicely. Have a great day Gents!",

Third time trying to shave with the DE. It went a lot better than the first two times. The first pass I had no nicks but I left too much stubble. On the second shave I gave myself razor burn on my neck again. I'm getting better but I'm definitely not there yet. After watching some tutorials I learned I was not lathering nearly enough and that my blade angle was off. Everyone here has been a huge help. I'm going to order a blade sampler I think. I'll probably get a better razor once I have a successful shave.",

And at first I wasn't thrilled with the Tallow + Steel soap recipe, but then I learned how to make it hum (firm brush, marco method, heavy loading), and between YRP and Classic -- which is bad ass, btw -- Tallow + Steel is pulling some heavy weight in the shave den these past several weeks.",

They lather effortlessly and provide great slickness. Barnacle Bob has been sitting on my shelf for awhile, but it didn't disappoint when I finally used it. Most aquatic scents I've tried smell like hand soap, but this one has enough going on to make it worth using. If you like [Catie's Bubble's Ocean Grove](https://trythatsoap.com/collection/198/?product_type=soap), I'd suggest checking out BB. It's similar, but without the fruitiness of OG.\n\nI always forget I have Armada Blossom, and I always forget what it smells like too. Little bit of spice, little bit of floral, and a little bit of sweet. It doesn't go with everything, but every time I use it, I'm happy.\n\n\n\n\n",

I grade my shaves and this was a B+. The blade might be getting a little tuggy at this point, but feels like it's serviceable for a couple more shaves. No real irritation to speak of, but one weeper due to bumping my Adam's apple with the blade. Light styptic touch handled it easily enough.",

I took Ye Olde Vegetable Peeler and shaved some vintage Williams into my Tabasco Chocolate tin.\n\nIt was hard as rock, but I didn't have time to bloom it. I just lightly wet the shavings and tried to get them to stick to the tin, then went at it with my gentlest brush so I wouldn't pick up any shavings. Normally I have to work at getting a lather using a boar, but I must have gotten the water right with the Plisson because the lather exploded easily. Thick and yogurty, which surprised me because it's usually much thinner.\n\nI don't say this often but the Tech was a mistake today with Williams. I really had trouble holding on to the razor because of the slickness of fingers - a razor with deeper more positive knurling would have helped.\n\nNone of my soaps are slicker than Williams. While I have soaps that are as slick, none of them are more slick, and most are less slick.\n\nExpecting the \"why does my cucumber taste like soap\" comment tonight as I only wiped down Ye Olde vegetable Peeler instead of washing it -- my wife is coming home before I do tonight and will probably start supper before I have a chance to intervene.",

The soap is thirsty as all hell, but produces a passable lather, which isn't bad for $1.25. The post shave feel is pretty good, but the soap is very drying and the scent is a simple soap smell. The blades were much like other Sword blades I've used in that they blow. I've surprisingly never used SkinBracer before, but I was pleasantly suprised. It had a generic masculine scent with a decent amount of menthol (not enough for me, but I'm a menthol freak). Overall a 7/10 shave, which isn't bad for the $8 the equipment cost me.",

So the wife picked me up some stuff from Nordstrom that is shave related for vday and well I guess I'll try it out tomorrow. One is shampoo/body wash the other is beard lube preshave/shave/moisturizing cream and a post shave gel. I have a feeling that I would have much rather spent the money or maybe I'll be shocked tune in tomorrow.",

It's classic, clean-smelling, and just works perfectly. The performance is out of this world. Easiest lather, slickest lather, and just thick slick performance in every sense of the word. This soap is definitely going into my rotation, and may replace Cade Thursdays with Tabac Tuesdays or something, because this soap definitely deserves its space with the classics.\n\nTried Unconditional Surrender balm again even though it probably doesn't align well with the Tabac scent. Just had to try it prior to Friday's soap release. It probably still ranks 3rd in my list of CL scents, behind GLS and Champs de Lavande. Definitely hoping I can snag a soap on Friday!

I remember it to be quite a good cream that used to be available pretty cheap ($5) at Rite Aid pharmacy a few years back. Sadly its no longer carried by any US stores, that I'm aware of.\n\nI used it for this mornings shave and it did not disappoint. The fact that its a decent cream makes sense since its made by Creightons which, I've read, makes the base creams for the \"3Ts\" of wet shaving. The scent is a pleasing tea tree scent and I found my shave to be very nice.\n\nGood day gents.",

I'm also noticing the blade I am using definitely has some pull to it. I ended up having to use my Executive DSC razor just to get everything even. Once the razor burn heals up I'm going to try again. I am determined to get this.",

You see the Perma-Sharp with the \"1\" next to it. I went to the bin with my original since I may have needed a tetanus shot if I [kept using it](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0Bx62Nre2N1zdMWZ0REZpMHc5Szg?usp=sharing). I don't know if that's rust or what, but I figure it wasn't worth the risk. It's too bad since my last shave with it was pretty good and I was looking forward to using in my H2 to see what it could do. Oh well, back to square one.\n\nFantastic shave this morning. Pretty much BBS. Dusted off RPS *Aviator* (one of my favorite scents in all of wet shaving) and topped off with *Unforgiven* and *Baux*.\n\nWent to see \"John Wick: Chapter 2\" last night with my oldest daughter. All kinds of mayhem was unleashed.\nGreat Wednesday shaves to all.\nEDIT: Formatting",

It does everything pretty well, though with the smaller tub holding a full soap size, loading can be a tad messy, but that's not really a big concern for me. The scent of this one is also unique among my soap collection. It's the only truly and utterly gourmand scent I have. Everything else in the gourmand category at least has some balancing property, but not this one. The scent profile lists floral and guiacwood notes, but to me\nit smells like spicy pear tarts, and it makes me hungry for a breakfast of soft cheese and pear tarts with some strong dark roasted coffee. The scent also made pairing a challange. Some amber scents would probably pair well. Most of the ambers I have are in samples and have either floral or woody elements that would clash with the soap, so I finally settled on Potion. There's enough sweet and spicy in it to marry them.\n\n\n\nHave a good one!\n\n\n\n**Soaps**\n\n[<< Dr. Jon's - Black Label](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5tz740/tuesday_sotd_thread_feb_14_2017/ddqcmxu/)\n\n[L & L Grooming - Cuir et Èpices >>](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5udqvo/thursday_sotd_thread_feb_16_2017/ddthgt1/)\n****\n\n**Tours**\n\n[Razor Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5lefc9/happy_new_year_sotd_thread_jan_01_2017/dbv6f4p/)\n\n[Brush Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5o322q/sunday_sotd_thread_jan_15_2017/dcgf5ud/)\n\n[Soap Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5q99m5/thursday_sotd_thread_jan_26_2017/dcxird1/)\n",

High tide at 2:15 this afternoon.\n\nNight Music is AMAZING!!!! I am glad that I picked up the soap and splash blind. Off the puck I was just getting vanilla and that is why I haven't tried it till today, just that vanilla smell making my stomach turn. But today I was up for it, and the soap smelled great. I splashed the aftershave onto my hands and face, and was like \"Really, this is it, it isn't that great smelling\" But I wasn't prepared for the dry down, when it all came together and just, uunnff.\n\nHave a good Wednesday!",

I de-funked it last night, but it's still a li'l funky, so I'm going to hit it with round 2 tonight.\n\nThe funk didn't keep me from testing it out this morning, however. My first impression is that it's a decent little brush. It's slightly floppy, which could have been due to the fact that it was soaking for hours last night and stood with a lather in it overnight, or could just be diameter x loft (which I forgot to measure). It also has some minor scritch, which I didn't really mind at all. It made a good lather, though it needs to be loaded a bit longer than I'm normally used to because it'll hold onto some water. I need a bit more time with it to really get to know it, of course, but I do like it so far.\n\n*Cedar & Spice* isn't really a scent that I reach for often, in part because I can never think of pairings for it. Which is weird, because I bet most of my vetiver stuff would complement it nicely, as well as **CADE** or Clubman Special Reserve. *Bosco* was a decent choice, but it's a much sweeter cedar-based scent than *Cedar & Spice,* which changes the profile a lot. That said, I really like *Bosco's* scent profile, so no harm done :)\n\nHappy Hump Day, all. Enjoy your shaves!",

Yesterday's shave went so well with the dry non-hydrated soap, so I wanted to see how well the soap performs if it's properly hydrated to start off with.\n\nIn a nutshell, it performed exactly like it did yesterday, that is to say, very well. I think this soap can work well bone dry if you add enough water to start off with. Even with one of my tiniest brushes, I had enough soap for 4 passes. The fourth pass was real thin though, but no worries, the gobs of slickness made up for it.\n\nWhen using the Krona today, I got to thinking that this razor might be a better lady shaver than the Lady Gillette because I think it's more aggressive. I haven't shaved with a Lady Gillette in probably a year or two, so it sounds like a good candidate for another Grudge Match. Start tuned.\n\nNew splash today, B&M Hallows 2016. It's no secret that I'm a huge fan of the soap, was bummed when the website glitches forced me to miss the 2015 soap, and was still pissed so I didn't bother ordering in 2016. An unused 2016 set came up for sale at a great price last weekend and I snagged it - thanks /u/andrewpalombo\n\nThe splash smells a lot like the soap, but for some reason, I did not enjoy the scent when I put it on. It was somewhat harsh and just didn't work for me. Fast forward to two hours later and it smells amazing after a good dry down. Very nice actually. Lavanille splash is the same for me; I don't like it that much when first applied, but it settles down nicely and has great longevity.",

Wow, I love the scent on their Bay Rum soap. I also have Bay Rum PS Balm, but I'm not in love with the scent on that - very clove heavy to me. The scent I get off the soap is much more bay-forward, with some spice and a bit of a fruity note (maybe) backing it up. It's kind of \"dark\" but smells incredibly refreshing as well. /u/stirlingsoap, is there a difference in the scents you guys put into your bay rum soap vs. PS Balm, or is the difference just how the fragrance reacts to the different ingredients in the base?\n\nThis Nacet might have felt a bit tuggier today, not sure. Just did a two-pass shave today and still feeling quite smooth.",

Also, I've never been good at tracking my blades. I always forget when I started with one, especially if I'm switching razors a lot. In the interest of blade longevity I've jeans stropped the blade the last two days, although I have no clue if that has helped or not. I think the fact that I'm nearly two years into this, and have \"perfected\" my technique through experimenting with a bunch of different razors and lots of different blades has more to do with it. This shave was a three pass WTG, XTG *light* ATG and netted a very pleasant BBS finish. I emphasize *light* ATG because I went pretty easy on my neck due to the number of shaves with this blade and switching up to a 7 on the Slim. Really no irritation to speak of, so I'll soldier on with the Astra/Slim combo and shoot for at least 15 shaves with it.",

      "body": "Todays shave was a new experience for me. As i am currently on week 2 of a 6 week+ fieldwork program I decided I would partake in the industries age old pastime of growing facial hair. As I will be in a remote work camp for the foreseeable future I thought this would make the perfect setting to play around with having permanent facial hair. I have never gone not clean shaven for more than 2 weeks before. I started off today with a circle beard goatee or whatever you call it (sorry I dont know facial hair styles). I see this going one of three ways over the next several weeks and I will keep updating here along with SOTD's, I decided its to thin and give up, I turn it into a jacksparrow style goatee or a handlebar mustache.\n\nRazor: Gillette slim adjustable cubano edition from delta echo razors\nBrush: Simpson s1 pure badger\nSoap: Lumberjack - by The Copperhat\nPostshave: Dapper dragon scale polish unscented\n\nThis soap is the second ever soap I purchased, It is a hard soap that comes in a tin. This is the main reason I use this soap while in the field, it is perfect for travel. The scent reminds me of campfire smoke and cedar, kind of like an cedar walled sauna. The performance is average but very dependent on water hardness. It is not my favourite soap but it fits the bill for fieldwork. The scale polish was phenomenal as per usual. If you have not tried this product you need to put it at the top of your list for purchasing.\n\nNow the shave was semi normal other than having to do it in a tiny mirror, using hardwater and leaving a weird patch of hair behind. I am still not entirely sure of how far down I am supposed to leave the goatee on my chin/neck. I removed everything from the notch between my chin and adams apple down. Figuring out the sides was easy and not saving my upper lip was a no brainer. Let the experiment begin.\n",

The only difficulty I'm having with this razor now is way on the side of my neck and really low on my neck. Most of the time, I don't see guys shave the lower part of their neck, but being overly hairy, it requires a clean up pass once or twice a week for me. I'm having a heck of a time doing it effectively and comfortably with this razor - I think the angle is just tough with how much the blade is bent and my chest being in the way and everything.\n\nI decided to try going balm --> splash to see how my skin feels (reason being so the balm doesn't cover as much of the splash's fragrance). Seems to feel alright so far. L'orange Noir is a good pairing with the orange note in Stirling's Bay Rum.\n\nAfter reading through discussion on the CADE post yesterday, I decided to pick up some tubes of Coates cream, so it'll be fun to try those out when they get here.\n\nHappy shaves, everyone!",

The jack black products my wife got me at Nordstroms are okay the beard lube preshave/shave/conditioning lotion is kinda weird but maybe made this blade feel like it has more life left than it did yesterday? The post shave gel is nice has a great feel and scent, but the scent is dead in about 12 seconds hence why I grabbed a bottle of CL. Overall it seems to be a good product I'm afraid to know how much she paid for it because I would have never bought it and will not be rebuying any of it.",

It's described as the scent of John Wayne's kitchen, and I don't think I could come up with anything more apt. Its sweet and spicy with an earthy, leathery base. Absolutely beautiful scent. The one performance note I'll say on the CeE soap in particular, is that it is a tad tricky to load. It's extremely soft. Softer than a cream, but more dense. I know Scott mentioned this had something to do with one of the fragrance elements in this scent. It means you need to go extremely soft on the pressure while swirling to avoid digging in, but that means it's tough to get the bristles to have any splay to open up to coat with soap. It's not terribly hard, you just have to really pay attention. Once loaded though, it performs exactly the same as the other L & L soaps in the bison base, which is spectacularly. Slickest of the slick, with a top tier post-shave feel. Pairing this one should be fairly easy. Anything in the leather or suede family of scents should do, especially anything with spicy elements. Chatillon Lux, Gratiot League Square EdT would be a nice choice (I used the salve version for my balm today). Some tobacco scents would also work as well, Burberry London, D & G The One, maybe CK One Shock. For me though, much like my pairing of Dreamer with Dr. Jon's Black Label, I've always paired this one with Hanae Mori HiM. They complement each beautifully, and I've enjoyed this combination very much every time I've used it.\n\n\n\nHave a good one!\n\n\n\n**Soaps**\n\n[<< Henri et Victoria - La Poire Française](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5u6dly/wednesday_sotd_thread_feb_15_2017/ddrvx6i/)\n\n[L & L Grooming - Marshlands >>](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5ul6zn/friday_sotd_thread_feb_17_2017/ddv29pm/)\n****\n\n**Tours**\n\n[Razor Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5lefc9/happy_new_year_sotd_thread_jan_01_2017/dbv6f4p/)\n\n[Brush Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5o322q/sunday_sotd_thread_jan_15_2017/dcgf5ud/)\n\n[Soap Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5q99m5/thursday_sotd_thread_jan_26_2017/dcxird1/)\n",

This is my first silvertip and it blew me away just how quickly and easily it built a lather. The soap and salve performed amazingly as always, and has become my go to on a cold day (currently -13 Celsius here). For anyone looking for added protection on a cold winter day (hopefully there aren't many left this winter), the Chatillon Lux salves are must haves! They feel great and since they don't feel greasy, I would say they can be used all year round, even on hot, humid summer days. /u/Hawns hit a homerun with this product. Looking forward to adding some aftershaves and toners to my den for the summer if the funds permit.\n\nRandom note, it's currently -13 (9 degrees Fahrenheit for the Americans) here, but Saturday is supposed to go up to 11 (52 for the Americans), crazy eh? Hence the need for a variety of aftershave types.",

The T+S line of soaps keep impressing me with each use, definitely a top tier soap maker as far as im concerned.\n\nOutside of that i finally finished off my Zoologist sampler, Bat was probably my favorite with Rhinoceros being a close second and Civet being my third.

When I received it, I realized the Seller did not exaggerate - almost every part of the head was bent in some way, making it a basket case. I put it away, and was planning on cannibalizing it for parts to fix the other G-code Fatboy I have with a stripped adjuster.\n\nLast night while watching TV on the couch, I decided to try my hand at straightening a razor as practice for my bent Aristocrat #58 and Rocket HD \"paperclip\". Armed with only a set of feeler gauges and a butter knife (yes, a butter knife), I started tweaking away. It took the better part of half an hour but ended up with a perfectly straight *calibrated* Fatboy.\n\nI shaved with the Fatboy today on 1 and frankly, the shave was vastly inferior to the Black Beauty on 1. The Fatboy felt waaaaaay milder and picky about angle. This is strange because the Fatboy gap on 1 is greater than one on the Black Beauty, and my Fatboy gap on 1 is exactly on-spec at 0.022\". More proof that the Black Beauty has different (and I say better) head geometry.",

I've never paid too much attention before, and have always just changed the blades after I have a subpar shave. So far I haven't had one. I don't know if I can attribute that to my technique, the blade or jean stropping it the last few days. My goal is 15 good shaves with it, and hopefully can stretch it to 20.",

To me, it's not great off the puck, but the lather and aftershave smell wonderful.\n\nThis was shave number 4 on the Voskhod blade. I'm thinking it's going to have to be tossed soon. The shave isn't bad, but it's not great. It's still a very smooth feeling shave but I'm getting patchy spots even on a three pass shave with touch ups. I've not pushed it further than that for fear of irritation, which I just can't have during the week. I have to wear a shirt and tie every day and neck irritation with a collared shirt is miserable.\n\nI had high hopes for this blade with the longevity challenge, but it may go in the bin this weekend.",

When I used it I still wasn't great at making lather and the scent didn't blow me away so I gave it to my dad to see it he might like it. I'm pretty sure he only used it once or twice and I kept hearing about how good this stuff is so I un-gifted it from him (I think on Christmas lol) and I just got around to using it for the first time again.\n\nGoddamn Bufflehead makes some nice lather! I almost wish I would have just kept it at my dad's so I wouldn't be tempted to seek this stuff out.",

Not because I'm sick of the soap, or just wishing that the soap was finished. It has become increasingly difficult to get my brush loaded with enough soap to create a good quality lather. Anyone who has tried to lather a partially loaded badger brush knows the struggle is real. Weak lather leads to sub-par shave, and sub-par results. This has been the finishing grind.\n\nI am satisfied that I actually finished a jar of soap, and am looking forward to the ease of loading my brush from a full surface area for my next shave.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/kOQyzdC.jpg\n\nEnjoy your shave, and your day.",

I used the best stuff I had and really tried to shave without any nicks or burn. So far it was the best shave I've had, but there were still issues. I had a tiny amount of blood and the one section of my neck seems rougher than the others. I was able to do the left side of the neck better than the right. I shortened up my strokes and was less afraid to go XTG this time. I purchased a blade sampler x2 so hopefully that will help me out as well.",

A huge THANK YOU goes out to /u/vigilantesd for the generous sample! Thank you, Sir. Even got to me with a nickname on the package! :-P This cream is extremely soft and I just smeared it on and proceeded to face lather. I believe it was /u/Huckleberryking that said that Simpsons was every bit or maybe better than CADE Rich, and he was correct. The scent was terrific as well. Well, I am not concerned about the demise of CADE Rich. It's a fantastic cream, but there are a handful out there that play to that same level and maybe beyond.\nTL;DR The shave kicked ass. Great Friday shaves to all.",

I got it last summer, made by a gentleman in a Facebook group I am a member of. The handle is comfortable and the knot is amazing. Great backbone, nice scrub, but still soft. Builds a lather like nobody's business.\n\nWith how cold it has been the past few days, and the snow too, I decided to look forward to the spring with my shave today, and the warm weather expected this weekend. The Creed OV was just icing on the cake. three different scents that work so well together. I close my eyes and feel like I'm at Wrigley Field.",

It's almost a straight vetiver scent, and it's the perfect base for many, many fragrance pairings. There are multiple types of vetiver that can be sourced from multiple regions of the world. To my nose, the one in Marshlands has an earthy, grassy and nutty aroma, and less of the woodier notes than some of its cousins, but is still unmistakably vetiver. Choosing a fragrance to pair with this is quite easy. Vetiver is a staple in fragrances, and anything with vetiver should do the trick, but it especially works as a good soap when using vetiver heavy fragrances. I've been looking for a chance to work this Amouage sample back into the rotation. It's a softer floral vetiver with an almost ethereal quality, but the vetiver lines up perfectly with the Marshlands.\n\n\n\nHave a good one!\n\n\n\n**Soaps**\n\n[<< L & L Grooming - Cuir et Èpices](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5udqvo/thursday_sotd_thread_feb_16_2017/ddthgt1/)\n\n[L & L Grooming - Puzzle >>](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5uroit/saturday_sotd_thread_feb_18_2017/ddwnrdd/)\n****\n\n**Tours**\n\n[Razor Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5lefc9/happy_new_year_sotd_thread_jan_01_2017/dbv6f4p/)\n\n[Brush Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5o322q/sunday_sotd_thread_jan_15_2017/dcgf5ud/)\n\n[Soap Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5q99m5/thursday_sotd_thread_jan_26_2017/dcxird1/)\n",

Everything seemed to go well enough but I go a couple tiny weepers here and there even though it didn't feel like it was happening. Odd. Anyway, I still love the look of this razor and I'll give it a few more tries before passing judgement. I Coloniali balm to the rescue!",

Caffeinated Aftershave Balm.*\n***Soundtrack:*** *Lyricist Lounge Vol. 1.*\n\n\n\nToday's shave ended up including a few products that are too easily overlooked. Let's go down the list:\n\n* **Through the Fire Fine Craft.** There was a thread not too long ago about underrated artisans, and Maria deserves to be near the top of this list. Her soaps are easily as good as anything I've ever used. They go toe-to-toe with literally every other soap base out there. The Maggard starter kits are an all-around high value, but honestly 80% of the reason that I recommend them to newbies is so that they'll be exposed to Maria's soaps. She's so underrated that I actually forgot to mention her in the underrated artisans thread. Every time I use TtFFC soap, I remember how dumb I am for not using it more often, and then come here to proselytize it.\n\n* **Gillette Super Speed.** Specifically, the humble Flare-Tip. Not *Flair,* because honestly this razor has none. It's not colorful like the blue or red tip. It's not sexy like the [Fatboy/Slim](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NfPIs9Zlc8), harsh, mild or aggressive. It doesn't really stand out in any way, but goddamn does it get the job done with minimal fuss. It's an all-around good performing razor: smooth and efficient (if mildly picky about angle). It's easily had for a few bucks, and in my opinion a worthwhile introduction to the vintage razor game, as well as a decent starter razor. Do I prefer the NEW to the Super Speed? Unequivocally. Still, this is not a bad choice at all.\n\n* **Pacific Shave Co. Caffeinated Balm.** It's a drugstore brand. It's not artisan-quality. It's also un-sexy. Still, it's inexpensive, widely available, and a great performer, with a nice, light spearmint scent. Is the caffeine a gimmick? Probably. This product is still worth having in the den, IMO, especially for the budget-conscious.\n\nDat brush, tho! After one shave, I'm glad that I did not sleep on this beast of backbone. It's wonderful and scrubby, with tips that are nice and soft. Zero scritch in this thing. It's worth every penny of $20. The handle is nice and comfortable as well. I would maybe like the color better if it were a deeper red, but I've a feeling that it'll grow on me. Thank you, /u/Assface_McGraw, for making available a brush that I never knew I needed hahaha.\n\nI think my kiddo is still fighting off the last vestiges of last week's illness. Yesterday, he woke just as I was getting into the shower, so I didn't have time to finish that shower, let alone shave, for tending to his needs. This morning, he woke at 05:30 because of a diaper blowout, which is always fun that early in the morning. Thankfully, it was early enough that I was able to get him cleaned up and in front of some *Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood* so that I could shower and shave, because goddamn did I need it.\n\nHave a great weekend, everyone!\n\n\n\n-----\n**EDIT:** *Copy/Paste error: Incorrect date.*\n**EDIT:** *Grammar.*",

I usually load for the week on Fridays, however I was sick last week, which delayed me in getting home, so I couldn't load until Monday. I was able to load, get all my deliveries done, do my pickups for the home leg, and get all those deliveries done and be empty yesterday.\n\nThat meant I didn't have time to shower on the road, so no truck stop shower this week. I was quite ripe when I got home, and had 4 days of growth.\n\nThe blade didn't even flinch. 3 passes to BBS without irritation, nicks, or weepers. I don't even have any blade feel in the Wolfman which has a mid-aggressive gap.\n\nCastle Forbes is the most expensive cream/balm I own, and I used it as a treat after a hard week's work. It's really good stuff that I was unsure about at first, but the scent has grown on me and I really enjoy it now.\n\nI'm going to do a touch up shave this morning before I go to load.\n\nSOTD today:\n\n* **Blade:** Gillette Platinum (8)\n* **Razor:** Wolfman WR1-SB 0.74mm on WRH7\n* **Brush:** Wolf Whiskers THBS Cranberry Crush TGN Grade A Silvertip\n* **Lather:** Chiseled Face Groomatorium Summer Storm\n* **Post:** Chiseled Face Groomatorium Summer Storm aftershave splash\n\nThe weather here is unreal. It's going up to 4C in Winnipeg today (that's about 40F for all of you Americans who can't join the rest of the free world with Celsius). I've put away Summer Storm for the winter because it's more of a summery scent, but in light of the warm weather, I'm looking forward to using it.\n\nLoad today, then a long weekend, and then I get to bust my ass again next week.

Well, I decided to fix that. I've always wanted to use an adjustable razor at 11, and that's what I did. I tweaked the gap at 1 from 0.022\" to 0.026\", which corresponds to a setting of 3. So now my setting 1 is actually a 3, and if you do the math, that makes the 9 setting feel like an 11. Stock gap at 9 is 0.045\" and mine is now 0.049\". Fatboy on 11 baby!\n\nI shaved at 11 today and for an aggressive razor fan, this is one sweet setting. Still perfectly smooth like a regular Fatboy on 9, but with a bit more bite. I have to say I hit it out of the park with this shave.\n\nIt'll be sad to see this blade get pitched at around 60 as it still works really well, but been there, did that, time to try another blade. Not looking forward to powering through those first few shaves until the blade settles down though.",

I remember walking into L'Occitane a few times this past year to smell their stuff because of /u/RaggedClaw's high praise for it and smelled Cade Rich before, but it didn't click. Today, my gf and I went to the mall and since it's discontinued, I decided to buy myself Cade Rich contingent on both of us enjoying the scent.\n\nWe walked, smelled it, and loved it. Oddly enough, we didn't really like the EdT, shave oil, or balm - we triple checked that we liked the cream. We check out and confirmed that it really is discontinued. Our cashier was shocked to hear that it was being discontinued and her manager confirmed - she was told so after placing an order of 6 more tubs (the second to last of which I purchased) and figured that was why the person who came in the day before me bought two tubs haha. (I just checked, my local L'Occitane is sold out now - good thing the gf came over to hang out today, jeez.)\n\nAnyway, the shave blew me away. Just 5 light swirls on the Jeffo gave me more than enough lather for my usual 2 pass shave and the citrus came to the forefront, which was the kicker that made me *love* the scent. I regret not trying it earlier. Had I bought a tub in the first month of me wetshaving, I probably would have bought a backup tub now for the future, but there are so many great scents in the market that I want to buy, I can't justify buying two tubs in the same year. I finally see the hype and I'm glad a tub of this stuff lasts *forever*. I'll be sad once this tub is gone, but I know it'll take me years to do so and when it does, there are plenty of other scents (like that L&L/CL Unconditional Surrender release today) to dull the pain :P",

It's mild but efficient. After each pass it feels like how it felt when I first started DE. When I first started DE I had little razor burn. After year and a half I finally got a BBS without burn. With this razor it feels like the old way but at the end I get BBS with little burn. I use the lightest pressure but with this razor being very light it kinda hard not too. Idk if it's the angle or the blade. I'll have to keep exploring to see what is going wrong. I know my lather is pretty good. I just don't know. Anything else I should be trying?",

It's good for these days where I don't have to go to work, but can't spend the day relaxing on the water. This way I feel like I'm there a little bit at least.

They have pipe tobacco listed but it's definitely more of a dry, cigarette type. Almost smells like opening a fresh pack of smokes.

So, look for that tomorrow if I have the wherewithal to film it.\n\nMitigating circumstances, not the least of which was the arrival of a generous *Cologne Russe* sample, also in yesterday's post, thanks to the generosity of /u/ajuicebox. I couldn't not shave with it today. And goddamn, it smells ***amazing***. Yet another wholly elegant scent from Will's oeuvre.\n\nI don't think that *Clubman Special Reserve* was really the correct pairing with it, but oh well; it's one of my favorite scents so I'll get over it.\n\nI like this brush more every time I use it. I have another of these cashmere knots that I'm going to drop into an old Ever-Ready handle one of these days. Maybe tomorrow if I can find the time.\n\nEnjoy your Saturday, everyone! I'm hanging with my kiddo this morning/afternoon and then going to a scotch tasting this evening. Should be a good day.",

I used no traditional aftershave today, as I wanted to smell the toner fully without any 'noise'. The toner has a pleasant scent that may find a spot in my rotation. I love the new packaging and labels. A+\n\nThis is my second shave with VY Calabria, and damn, this Van Yulay soap continues to impress me with it's all-around performance. I'll probably get a few more samples to try before pulling the trigger on a full tub of my favorite scent. Great stuff.\n\nLong weekend for me since my company give us off for President's Day.

The profile of the head is small, as compared to my Parker Variant, which made it nice for getting in the tight spots like under my nose. I also like the agressive cut with it, I have thick, wiry beard hair, so it handled the job well after two days of no shave. The Rapira shaved well with it, though I can't say it's in my favorite blades, I still find the feel of Feathers or Astras to be better. I'm always a fan of the 1907, after struggling for probably the last year to find the right technique to lather it, my boss clued me in to how he lathers glycerin soaps, and it worked fantastically.",

First time loading soap from a full-sized tub, and it's much nicer than samples, or even using a shaving stick. Still exploring blades, though, so at least that will give me variety. Oceana smells pretty nice, though weirdly enough, I most like the smell remaining on the brush after I rinse it - there I can really catch the jasmine, sandalwood. When shaving, it blends together much more.",

The first time I smelled it, it immediately invoked a strong memory for me, but I couldn't quite place it. After a few days it hit me. It was an orange hand soap they had at my dad's company when I was a kid. Not the same, but similar. Orange was the only correct note I guessed for the puzzle. Like the other L & L soaps, performance was excellent again today. Pairing this one is a little interesting. Neroli, or other bright green bitter scents would do well. I also find cardamom and patchouli work well with it. Today I actually had a last minute swap out. You can see in the pic, I setup to go with YSL La Nuit de L'Homme, but at the last minute swapped out for the Amouage. They compliment well, but with the exception of the neroli, they don't overlap much.\n\n\n\n* Blade Longevity Challenge Update: I've now reached a new high blade usage at 14. I had made 13 before, and tossed it not because it was done, but I was deep cleaning my razors and tossing out all used blades.

Hot damn is it a great brush! As others said before me, it's far better looking in person and I'm stoked to have the privilege to own one.\n\nThis was the second shave with Iliahi Ridge, and I'm impressed so far. The slickness isn't just hype, it's really THAT good. I'm still dialing it down, given the fact that the second lather was notably better this time, so hopefully the performance will continue to improve.\n\nI hope everyone has a great evening!",

I worry I've cured my SAD...\n- Soap: Tabac\n- Brush: 30mm tuxedo in whipped dog handle\n- Razor: Ikon x3 on mr5 handle\n- Blade: Astra SP\n- Post: Stirling Sandalwood balm\n\nAlthough my wife believes this state of mania is temporary, I've been using Tabac almost exclusively for the last week. It's just the best performing soap I've ever used, and it smells so nice and light I can pair it with nearly any aftershave, which seems to be my favorite part anyway.\n\nI set my first knot into a handle thanks to some help from /u/dendj55. Really trying to minimize my collection and really find the top performers in each category. After using my Declaration Franklin and my Rockwell 6s almost exclusively for the last few months, I decided to try out this new brush and also give my slants a try again. I find that although the 6S shave is effortless, it takes more maneuvering of the head to get the right efficiency, especially where my head is concerned. The x3 mowed through everything. The brush also performed admirably. My Maggard synth was a great intro but it flung soap more often than I prefer and wasn't big enough for my tastes. Will update you all if i end up getting off this Tabac train or if I keep on rolling with it. Happy Sunday everyone!",

I got my two samplers in the mail yesterday and that Personna blade really helped a lot. This time I had a few nicks but did not really razor burn myself. I started maintaining a straight line on my neck and that worked a lot better for myself. Also that shave oil isn't half bad, it was world's better than I anticipated. Especially since I don't care for Dr. Carver's Aftershave. Have a great day everyone.",

It's a combination handle of Mesquite Wood and Marine Pearl resin. It came out stunningly beautiful. Even better than I had hoped for when we were going back and forth to work out the details. From the smooth transition between the two stock materials, to the detailing in the wood, everything came together very well. The detailing also provides the slightest bit of texture, which was fantastic for grip when lathering. I had him drop in one of the White Knight Manchurian knots that he stocks. From a test lather and one usage, my initial impression is that this one is quite similar to the Elite Manchurian knot. To try to get a better comparison between them, I'm going to temporarily drop my other brushes out of rotation, and go back and forth with these those two exclusively for the next 10-20 shaves. I'm extremely happy with the brush, and the process of working with G_huck to have it made. If you're looking for a custom, I have no reservations recommending working with him.\n\n\n\nIt's TSM Fougère all the way down today. This one is my favorite L & L soap, because I love the Chatillon Lux TSM Fougère scent. It is deeply green and vegetal scent, with herbal and earthy edges. It's the scent of spring, when everything is growing, and the flowers have budded, but have yet to fully bloom. It's a deep and rich scent in the soap, but brighter notes really shine in the toner and EdT. Fragrance pairing today was a no brainer. It's not often you can do the full stack top to bottom. If that's not an option though, it would pair well with fougères that don't stray too far into the fresh and soapy. D & G Pour Homme, Azzaro Pour Homme, Paco Rabbane Pour Homme would all work well.\n\n\n\nHave a good one!\n\n\n\n**Soaps**\n\n[<< L & L Grooming - Puzzle](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5uroit/saturday_sotd_thread_feb_18_2017/ddwnrdd/)\n\n[L & L Grooming - Trismegestus >>](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5v3lkj/monday_sotd_thread_feb_20_2017/ddz7q0e/)\n****\n\n**Tours**\n\n[Razor Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5lefc9/happy_new_year_sotd_thread_jan_01_2017/dbv6f4p/)\n\n[Brush Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5o322q/sunday_sotd_thread_jan_15_2017/dcgf5ud/)\n\n[Soap Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5q99m5/thursday_sotd_thread_jan_26_2017/dcxird1/)\n",

I ordered an 8oz bottle off Amazon, but I had to wait a month to try it due to shipping issues. It was well worth the wait, and it is easily my favorite frag that I have tried so far. If you haven't tried Grey Flannel yet, you are missing out.",

The Omega 40033 seems to want a hard soap to work with. I obliged it. A nice long 30 second load and I had enough for 4 passes plus a little more. This is a really thirsty soap, so it took me a while to work in enough water.\n\nThis blade will definitely make it to 50, but I'm not sure if it will go beyond that. If not for curiousity, I would have pitched it at 40 out of boredom.\n\nUnbelievable as this sounds, I'm going to spread the Spring application of fertilizer on my lawn today. The weather kinda demands it. The early weeds will start to germinate this week because of the run of warm weather. I can remember only one other February in which I put fertilizer down. The down side is I will likely need to start cutting grass early this year. Off to do it.",

At first I was disappointed that it didn't come with a WRH7 (my favorite) handle, but this BBS-1 inspired handle is starting to grow on me. I'm really happy that it's aluminum too because I love the weight. Maybe next time James opens his list I'll try and get myself an aluminum WRH7 to fulfill my dreams or something :p anyway I did a cold water shave last night and it was really smooth off the bat - the angle was easy to find and everything. Gonna try messing around with the angle and see what works best and how comfortable it is with my regular routine. So far, first impressions are good.. Now if I can just get my shit to sell to help pay this off..",

There are very few shaving scents that I enjoy this much. And I hadn't used it in a while.\n\nThanks to the last couple of shaves using Cade Rich, I either underloaded or felt underloaded, but I got a decent three passes worth of lather. Probably could have eked out a fourth if I'd wanted to.\n\nNow, I'm trying to see how long I can comfortably use this blade. Someone posted about this last week, so I figured I'd give it a shot with what I guessed would be the longest-life blade in my den. Today's shave was less comfortable than the last one, and noticeably less comfortable than the first five. I've not given up hope yet, but if it doesn't smooth out in the next couple of shaves, I'm moving on from this blade. Regardless, I've finally established a relationship with my Damaskeene, and it will certainly be a part of my usual rotation going forward.",

Date TBD, but definitely sometime in the next two weeks.\n\nI don't use Catie's Bubbles often enough, mostly because I only have this one tub and too many other choices. I should remedy that soon. This soap is so goddamn good it surprises me all over again each time I do use it.\n\nSo does this brush. it's nice, dense and scrubby. It's made me learn to love badger brushes again, so I'm going to need to start exploring those later this year. I don't know that I want to jump straight into a Declaration, but I'm definitely going to pick up a Stirling sometime soon. Just gotta decide between the bulb and the fan.\n\nThere's an 80's Ski Party going on at a bar owned by some friends of mine, today, and I'm thinking about heading down later this afternoon. We'll see, though; I'm nursing a hangover today and not really feeling it.\n\nHappy Sunday all :)",

It's a great scent, and something I need to pickup a full-sized tub of before summer.\n\nAs seen in the picture, I thought I would go with Bon Vivant for my a/s today, but then I remembered I had an unused sample of Sandpiper. Sandpiper is a really nice cologne scent, so if you're into Executive Man or Sharp Dressed Man, I think you'll like Sandpiper.\n\nShave #6 on the Voskhod was better than the previous 3 shaves, but I also remembered my Heljestrand had been unloved for a while, so I used it to mow down most of my growth.\n\nI may have to throw the blade in my Slim to see if shave quality will improve.",

It's great stuff.\n\n[Graphite by Montana](http://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Montana/Graphite-13518.html) costs about $30 which is impressive considering the quality of the juice.

I don't know if Scott spilled a few extra crystals in this bottle, but all I got off the splash was menthol. Wowza.",

The soap was a sample from that flying monkey, /u/airbornesimian. This individual does not mess around with samples. He sent me very close to 1/4 pucks as samples. I should get at least 50 shaves out of these babies. Very nice.....\n\nBack to the fray - Tabac is one serious soap. I'm a little confused on the scent being somewhat polarizing, but each to his own. It's a beauty, in my opinion. The post shave feel is the real deal. The overall performance was nothing to snicker at.\n\nThe ATT S2 head - I've been schizophrenic on the performance of this head for a long time. Sometimes I truly question the efficiency of this head and other times I feel it's as good as it gets. I Loaded up a fresh Balzano and had an excellent shave. Balzanos are my \"go to\" in any razor My mental issues continue to haunt me, day after day.\n\nOn the Semogue OC Boar front. Those who know, just plain know.\n\nEnjoy the shaves, you shameless slaves.....\n",

The entire week may, actually. Lately it seems that they all do. Oh, well.\n\nI'm in such a funk that I needed to bring out the big guns, today. Dapper Dragon ain't nothing to mess with, and an excellent shave helped me feel human again this morning. This is 100% a desert island shave for me.\n\nAt this point, there's little chance that this Astra won't make it to 40 shaves, and 50 isn't even out of the question given how it's shaving right now. The most I can do with it before needing to shelve it for March is going to be about 41, which is cool, because I'm going to need to change it up soon anyway.\n\nHave a good Monday, everyone. Enjoy your shaves!",

I've since determined that there is a sour, bitter element to the Terre d'Hermes inspired scents that can be a bit much for me. It isn't bad, just not my favorite. Obviously if you have TdH, it would pair well, but other vetiver heavy fragrances would also work. Franck Olivier Black Touch also has a sour note and pairs well. Lalique Encre Noire, would be a good choice. I went with the Hommage a l'Homme Voyageur to add a little more brightness, but it has the same vetiver core as the Encre Noire, so they complement nicely.\n\n\n\nHave a good one!\n\n\n\n**Soaps**\n\n[<< L & L Grooming - TSM Fougère](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5uxhk6/sunday_sotd_thread_feb_19_2017/ddxt1ri/)\n\n[L.A.

It's been a few weeks since I used it last, and compared to the razors I've used in the meantime (R89, 39C), it's immediately noticeable how much more efficient the Parker is - and without the feeling that I'm about to cut myself to ribbons that I get using the R41. I had 2 days' growth to shave, and after 1 pass I was so smooth I debated whether a second was even necessary. I did a quick one, which, a couple isolated rough patches tell me I should have paid more attention, but my god, what a great shave.",

A lot more blade feel than what I had at the beginning of the blade's life, but not unpleasant at all.\n\nThis blade longevity challenge is eye opening.\n\n/u/NeedsMoreMenthol does it matter where the rough patch is in the blade's life cycle? Is that any indication of how long a blade will last?",

I'm back at the socal office today and jet lagged, but it feels great to be back home and with family.\n\nAs to whether the trip was a \"game changer\" or not, only time will tell.\n\nI was able to spend a day in the city of Bangkok and enjoy some of the sights. Wat pho, wat arun, khaosan road, mbk mall, silom/ patapong night market. It's a fun city with very warm and hospitable people. Would love to visit again!",

She was a bit confused as to why there was a dickbutt on the jar. Then I told he rot smelled like hot dog water. She said we are a bunch of strange people and left the bathroom =)\n\n[The Beat](http://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Burberry/The-Beat-for-Men-4509.html) is a pretty nice smelling frag. Amazing or special? No. I get mostly sweet orange and cedar from it. Some people online swear there is a ton of pepper in it but I don't notice it at all. I've noticed Burberry frags always smell nice but never smell great. Easy to wear and wonderful for the office.\n",

I never really smelled the vanilla sweetness in this soap until I read a comment on a blind sample here and I don't know how I didn't before..\n\nThis razor is so smooth. After a few months of straight razor shaving I think I have eliminated all the variables that can give a bad shave and now I'm just enjoying it. I get consistently better shaves with straights than I ever have with DEs. I just think the thinner blades don't play nice with my skin.\n\nTomorrow on the tour is Dapper Dragon - Signature.

Had a pretty nasty cut on my right jawline. Didn't even get through the first pass this time. The shave butter I used was a 5$ pick up at Giant Eagle and it is awful. It smells clinical and it takes a lot just to get a decent spread on your face. I'm posting a picture of it so others can avoid it, or prove me wrong. Hope everyone's Shave was better than mine!\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/DDQXM",

I like the smell of Vision, and the freshness is nice to have in the morning. However, it wasn't until my first use of it today that I remembered that it had peppermint oil in it. Wew lad, my balls are chilly. I'm glad I didn't go for the cryogen soap I had my eye on!",

Went and checked it out and found that they were selling one of the soaps I've been wanting to try since I came across Shaver Heaven, Plum Tea. This scent is fantastic. Right out of the tub you get the sweetness from the plum and melon, and then mellows out to the white tea. Very light and refreshing.\n\n\nMy fiancee and I went down to Canton this weekend to help find a lost dog from the organization that we rescued our dogs from. Spotted her a few times while we were down there but no one was able to capture her. The family ended up capturing her on Sunday morning on the 5th day of being loose.\n\n\n**Have a great shave everyone!**",

I just do not get good lather out of it. I think it may need a drier brush for loading. Even while loading a very airy foam develops. This continues during the lather building. Very, very airy and foamy lather is built, rather than a thick creamy water dense lather. I think I need to spend some time figuring this one out if I continue using it, as my normal lathering technique has not worked well. Even with the foamy lather, the glide wasn't terrible, though the protection was very scant, and I could feel the blade much more, along with a lot of excess blade chatter. Scent on this one though is very nice, so I think it will be worth trying to figure out the lathering for it. It's an earthy, woody rose scent. This finally gave me a chance to try out the Rose Verte sample I received, which was fantastic. Scent was great and of course the CL toners always treat me right. The soap is also a great pairing for the the SLSM, though it would work well with other rose heavy fragrances. Cartier Declaration d'Un Soir, and Amouge Lyric Man are the other two I've tried that would work very well.\n\n\n\nHave a good one!\n\n\n\n**Soaps**\n\n[<< L & L Grooming - Trismegistus](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5v3lkj/monday_sotd_thread_feb_20_2017/ddz7q0e/)\n\n[Lather & Wood Shaving Co. - Barbershop >>](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5vhp0v/wednesday_sotd_thread_feb_22_2017/de2da63/)\n****\n\n**Tours**\n\n[Razor Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5lefc9/happy_new_year_sotd_thread_jan_01_2017/dbv6f4p/)\n\n[Brush Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5o322q/sunday_sotd_thread_jan_15_2017/dcgf5ud/)\n\n[Soap Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5q99m5/thursday_sotd_thread_jan_26_2017/dcxird1/)\n",

If you're interested in horsehair brushes, this isn't a bad one to pick up, although if you're here reading this you may prefer to hunt down the best deal on a similar brush that uses this knot. That said, I feel like it's worth a couple dollars' markup to support the entry of a good shaving product into the big box retail market. I haven't tried their new cream yet, and don't really plan to because I have too much soap already, and I'm not huge on sandalwood, but I'm glad they're trying to move the market away from those awful pure badger things that have been on shelves for years.\n\nI have some thoughts about this brush that I want to put down for people who may be interested in it, so I think I'll try to use it semi-exclusively for the rest of the week to get a li'l more experience with it, and then do some kind of write-up about it this weekend or something.\n\nHappy Tuesday, everyone. Enjoy your shaves!\n\n\n\n-----\n**EDIT:** *Copy/paste error. I really gotta start submitting these things while I'm actually conscious.*",

Also tried an Astra Platinum after months of using the Feather and got a really good shave from it. I suspect my technique has improved since the last time I tried it :)\n\nAs far as the soap, probably not much to say about it that hasn't been said. Really great smell, which I have heard is a very close match to TdH. Terre du Dragon on the other hand is sweeter than Trismegistus, but goes very well with it; not surprising since it is also inspired by TdH.\n\n\n\n\n",

I really had no idea what to expect other the best performance as with all L&L soaps. I am going to have to review the scent notes to help my poor nose discern better but i like this scent a lot. I was fortunate to get some of the limited edition soap. I had a friendly redditor add the CL post shave salve to a trade we worked out recently and it was my first experience with CL. WOW. I wi be getting more CL soon. It is awesome even when the shave isn't great. I have yet to meet a L&L soap that does not perform well and smell great. Several of my top scent a are Cuir et Epices, Trismegistus (just got that as well), Puzzle and UC. I need to get some TSM Fougere yet. Enjoy.",

It doesn't get as much discussion as the biggie's like Lavanille and Seville, or the controversial ones like Roam or NM, and yet, it's so elegant. It's complex and rich, but not overpowering or heavy. It would be my choice for which one I'd like an EdT in.",

Got the Duke 3 Silvertip in yesterday and it is better than I expected. Basically a perfect 2 band badger cloud with very slight scrub from the 2 band hair. I continue to come back to a Duke 3 as my baseline for brushes. Great knot diameter to loft ratio, great density that doesn't obstruct flow through, and not a cumbersome oversized brush/knot. Definitely worth a try, even if you think you like mega big brushes.\n\nBarbershop train is chugging along. Signature is an excellent scent that I always enjoy. Next up is Shannon's Barbershop, which is pretty much indistinguishable from The Kraken to me.",

Thankfully, as a result of a fix that I applied, it looks like everything's kosher once again, which is awesome because this issue has been plaguing me for literally months. Then, my kiddo woke in the middle of the night and came to bed with me, which means I slept from about 00:30 until about 03:15, then again from maybe 04:30 until 06:00.\n\nSo, I'm bright-eyed and bushy-tailed today.\n\n/u/Fahrenheit915's soap is really good. The vanilla-forward nature of *Spellbound Woods* is a li'l too far on the sweet side of things to really be in my wheelhouse, but it does have a nice, relaxing quality. *Clubman Classic Vanilla* takes the sweetness right out of it, and makes it nice and *Clubman-esque*, which really is perfect for me.\n\nExcellent shave, all around. On the downside, I definitely felt a little toothiness from my Astra SP during the first pass, today. Zero irritation, and everything was smooth sailing beyond that, so we'll see what it meant as the week progresses.\n\nHappy Wednesday, everyone.",

I'm guessing they do all their sales through Amazon to normal consumers, and just haven't really penetrated the hobbyist market. It's one I picked up from amazon very early on before finding the reddit shaving subs. A little research leads me to believe they originally sold soap as hard pucks that may have had some performance issues. Eventually I think they switched to have these manufactured by someone else or their manufacturer changed formulas. The tub from Amazon appears to be a hot process tallow soap, that comes out to a medium firm croap. I don't know that I would recommend it, since I can find so little about the company, but the tub I have is actually a really good performer. It sucks trying to load it out of the little tin, that was poured full of 4.7 oz of soap, but once loaded it makes a creamy, slick, protective lather. There is also a good amount of residual slickness, and the post-shave is pretty decent. Closest comparison I have would be the B & M White Label base, both in soap texture and performance. At $16 for 4.7 oz, it's not a terrible deal on a decent soap, but like I said, too many unknowns to actually recommend it. Scent is a nice clean barbershop scent, in the same family as GTB or Mike's. Aromatic fougères would be a good place to look for pairings. I decided to go with one I like quite a bit, despite it's humble mass market status. Aspen from Coty. They may butcher a lot of stuff they buy up, but this one remains on the market and sells because its cheap and smells pleasant. It won't blow you away with performance, or intrigue you with mysterious notes, but it is an easy wear that smells nice, clean and simple. Some days that's exactly what I'm looking for.\n\n\n\nHave a good one!\n\n\n\n**Soaps**\n\n[<< L.A.

It had loss some efficiency after 10 or so uses, but today felt like I was shaving with a set of tweezers. I'll load a new one tomorrow and keep it in the same razor for consistency. We'll see if I get better results.\n\n-----\n\nAlso, if your face is feeling dry, follow these guaranteed steps for success:\n\n1. Wet face\n2. Place a dime-sized amount of Shea butter in your palm\n3. Mix Shea with a splash of water until you get a nice paste\n4. Slather mixture all over your face... then your arms.... then literally any other patch of dry skin because you have way too much Shea butter for what you need\n5. Don't touch your face for the rest of the day because it's tacky AF\n6. Success?",

Unfortunately, I sold it after 1 use due to irritation. I bought another tub with my Unconditional Surrender in hopes that the irritation was due to brush burn... It wasn't :( My cheeks and upper lip burned like crazy. Thankfully I don't love it as much as other stuff in my den, but I still was a little disappointed. Using Bod right after wasn't such a great idea either.. Those MLS splashes have a bit of alcohol bite :P Decided to use US salve after that, which helped a lot.",

I do have one other sample that works, but it is basically the same exact scent as Stirling, so I'll skip it. Barbershop is an interesting scent category open to interpretation.\nHaven't used a synthetic in a while and it was a nice change of pace. I used to have a CH2 synthetic, but found it had too low of a loft. The Duke may be on the low side, but doesn't have the same density, so it is still able to splay.",

I did not make a perfect lather on this one. It was a little thin but that did not cause any issues as I still had plenty of cushion and slickness.\n\nWhen I started wetshaving I was an every other day shaver. I was not getting cuts just a little irritation, but lately my technique seems to have gotten much better and I'm getting closer shaves with less irritation. I think I am going to try going to shaving every day to see how it feels.",

When I was using cartridges I used to go straight down without any issue. Anyways I hope everyone had a good day.",

I enjoy listening to it with my windows cracked or sitting on the screen porch at home - it's just relaxing for me. Not needing to water my yard is also a big plus.\n\nIn the spirit of love/hate I decided to go with a polarizing shave today. Lately Night Music has been the big polarizing soap on the scene - I wanted to go a bit further down the path though (plus my Night Music EdT is lost in the mail so I'm avoiding the soap/splash atm)\n\nToday I reached into storage box #1 for that Mother Fucking Roam. I feel like nothing could stop me today - I will be king, at least until I get home and she smells me. Roam seems loyal but it never lies, it will keep me happy all day then stab me in the back on first kiss of the evening.\n\n\n__________________________\n\n\n**Prep**: Morning shower -Soap Commander Honor\n**Lather**: Barrister and Mann - MFRoam (glissant)\n**Brush**: Paladin butterscotch PK47\n**Razor**: Rockwell 6s plate 3\n**Blade**: Polsilver SI 8th use\n**Post**: MFRoam Tonique\n**Frag**: None - I want to be able to smell Roam as long as possible today.

It does settle in nicely though. The frag was recommended to me as a clone of Tom Ford's Oud Wood, with them saying it may even be better than the original. I definitely enjoy this frag, it's solid. Everything else performed as expected, great brush, razor and blade.\nIt's February and we're going into double digits in temperature (in Celsius, though raining and possible thunder storms later today). Darkfall seemed like a great choice as it feels more like an October day than it does February.",

It really doesn't get the attention that it deserves. Aside from being triple-milled, highly performant and completely delicious, it also loads like a dream. I actually managed to overload it, this morning, which meant that I had enough lather for 3 shaves in my brush.\n\nI was going to use my Vie-Long brush again, this morning, but my attention span broke and I realized that I just don't really enjoy shaving with the same brush every day. So I'll get back to it as soon as I can.\n\nThe Astra blade is still trucking along. It's definitely giving me more tactile feedback now on my WTG pass, but it doesn't really seem to have lost any efficiency for that.\n\nI'm going to an art show this evening, so I wanted to smell classy. That means *Beaudelaire,* Though I suppose I could have gone with *Lavanille* just as easily.\n\nHave a great Thursday, everyone. Weekend's nearly here!",

The primary heart of this is a conifer scent balsam or pine, but underneath that is a subtle sweet bready note. Along with this I'm picking up lightly sour berry notes, maybe cherry or cranberry, along with very light citrus, maybe lemon or orange. To me, it comes together to smell like fruit cake and Christmas trees. It's really a lovely scent, and perfect for the winter. The MLS lathers easy and has great performance. I've always paired this one with Yatagan, but anything with heavy conifer woods would do well.\n\n\n\nHave a good one!\n\n\n\n**Soaps**\n\n[<< Lather & Wood Shaving Co. - Barbershop](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5vhp0v/wednesday_sotd_thread_feb_22_2017/de2da63/)\n\n[Mike's Natural Soaps - Barber Shop >>](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5vwjba/friday_sotd_thread_feb_24_2017/de5nwdz/)\n****\n\n**Tours**\n\n[Razor Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5lefc9/happy_new_year_sotd_thread_jan_01_2017/dbv6f4p/)\n\n[Brush Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5o322q/sunday_sotd_thread_jan_15_2017/dcgf5ud/)\n\n[Soap Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5q99m5/thursday_sotd_thread_jan_26_2017/dcxird1/)",

It's also got that satisfying resonating blade toast-buttering sound like the Ever Ready 1914, and come to think about it, shaves kind of similarly. It shaves more like an SE than a DE.\n\nCool - so now I have a DE (Wardonia) that shaves like an SE (ER 1914) and an SE (Featherweight) that shaves like an Injector (Type E2), and an Injector (Type B & C) that shaves like a DE (oval-slot Tech).

Usually I go WTG, XTG, ATG... but if I shave at night, a BBS is kind of pointless because it's short lived before I fall asleep. So last night I went WTG, WTG, WTG out of curiosity. Definitely didn't get a BBS, though it would have been a passable shave to go through a day with. And when I woke up this morning, there's not much difference from any other time I shave at night. I think next time I'll try WTG, XTG, XTG and see if that's much better.\n\nI started the ring of death on the soap last night, so even though I usually use a different soap every time I shave pretty much, I'll probably stick with that one until it's gone now.",

I think I bought it when The Dead Sea came out? Yeah, it's been in there awhile. The scent isn't really what I expected when I bought it, but it smells pretty good. I think I expected the leather to make it smell more like Cuir Et Epices or Gratiot League Square, which have sweeter notes to them, but aside from a little bit of citrus, this isn't a very sweet scent. I will say that the aftershave comes off very alcohol heavy at first, but gets to the scent on the dry down.\n\n",

I really love how the scent comes through in the soap. Excellent performance as always.\n\nThe razor is interesting. It only accepts the provided handle due to the design because the top threads screw through the entire top cap. The shave is good. Efficient yet mild feeling. I didn't do a third pass due to time, yet got a nice comfortable shave.\n\nI must have gotten lucky with the brush.

You guys are all awesome. Anyway, the scent. Holy shit the scent. As a person who's looked for a nice single note sweet pipe tobacco scent and dislikes all of the vanilla and cherry ones that are out there I can say that this is a different beast entirely. I find most of the other tobacco forward scents to be artificial and cloying not unlike their aromatic tobacco inspirations. The soap is more chocolate orange dry, but it opens up to reveal all of the other scents. Of course the CB base is great as would be expected. Porch Drinks aftershave opens with orange alcohol and chocolate/coffee and then dries to a wonderful pipe tobacco. I put a tiny bit on yesterday and as the day went along it softened and became a little powdery. Very, very nice. I'm super happy to have been able to try it out, and I hope I can grab some up for keeps! About the only negative is that now I want to sit out on my back porch with a drink and a pipe instead of going to work. It's Friday everyone, enjoy the weekend!",

I'm not into Fierce as much, and I thought it would be a bit cloying, but when I lathered, it was perfectly fine. This is coming from a guy sensitive to strong scents.\n\nI felt the lather with my hands and applied it on my face as my preshave, I noticed quickly how slick it is. The slickness is remarkable, I find it even better than some of our long time artisans.\n\n\nThe soap was easy to lather, even with my brand new, unbroken in, lather hogging manchurian badger.\n\n\nBy the way, thank you Fierce scent, the Badger funk was kept at bay.\n\n\nThe lather was also remarkably thick, and all in all very protective. To think I just nicked myself badly yesterday (on the upper lip of all places, and yes it hurts), but today nada, all good and pleasant.\n\n\nI think the performance is right up there with our top artisans, you did good brother. Thank you again for the opportunity to test it. :)",

I unfortunately missed the soap but the EdT is all I really need. Great amber scent that doesn't come off sweet. I have another custom from /u/hawns that contains Amyris and I have a hard time describing it but I do know it smells pretty great. Just hurry up and buy whatever Unconditional Surrender products you can before they are gone. You will be happy that you unconditionally surrendered yourself to its awesomeness. =)",

I was feeling the call of Sandalwood and as always the AoS NOS hard soap delivers every time. I know that Derby gets very little love, but I've always seemed to get passable shaves from them, so I've loaded up another this week. It's certainly not my preferred blade, but it gets the job done. A nice DFS was had. Good day gents.",

It's dark, dreary and rainy outside today so I wanted something comfortable. Enter B&M Seville and CL Champs de Lavande. Both are great products and my skin feels absolutely amazing! The scents are mild, but very much enjoyable. Performance is top notch!",

Performance is good, but my understanding is that Mike's has been around a while, and I think some of the newer artisan bases may have passed it by. It's good, just not at that next level of excellence. It's a very firm soap. Almost as hard as the triple milled soaps I have, which makes more work for loading and lathering. Really that is biggest stand out on the performance side. Of course in terms of value, that's probably a bonus, since less product weight is water. Once lathered the cushion is excellent, and the glide good, as are the residual slickness and post-shave. The scent is interesting. The basic fragrance structure is the same as the basic barbershop underlying Ghost Town Barber, but I think I'm also picking up fairly strong scents from the soap base itself. I think it may be the clay that I'm picking up, almost as a wet earthy scent underlying the fragrance. It is actually a pretty nice complement to the barbershop scent. Currently they are making a Rose and Cedarwood soap that I will probably pick up at some point, so it is definitely good enough that I will try more in the future. Pairings for this would be similar to other barbershops. Fougères would generally work well, and I felt like Azzaro today.\n\n\n\nHave a good one!\n\n\n\n**Soaps**\n\n[<< Mickey Lee Soapworks - Through the Woods](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5vpfzi/thursday_sotd_thread_feb_23_2017/de40w4d/)\n\n[Nivea Men - Moisturizing Shaving Gel >>](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5w3adj/saturday_sotd_thread_feb_25_2017/de78f9e/)\n****\n\n**Tours**\n\n[Razor Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5lefc9/happy_new_year_sotd_thread_jan_01_2017/dbv6f4p/)\n\n[Brush Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5o322q/sunday_sotd_thread_jan_15_2017/dcgf5ud/)\n\n[Soap Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5q99m5/thursday_sotd_thread_jan_26_2017/dcxird1/)\n",

That thing is wicked sharp, on par with the feathers. Been getting consistent BBS shave after just 2 passes and it's my 5th time using the blade. For habit, I always throw out my blades after 4 time usages. Might make it a challenge to see if I can got up to 10.",

Complete blind buy. It doesn't appear it sold very well based on it being discontinued, but it's certainly interesting in that red wine (Cabernet Sauvignon) was used in place of water. Notes are citrus, vanilla, and some floral. Will be shaving with it tonight, so will edit the post with scent impression of the lather and whether the lather quality differs with it being wine based instead of water.\n\nedit: So, not going to lie, I didn't have high hopes for the scent going into the shave. The smell off the puck is a little off putting. Not sure if it's the wine, but it definitely made me wrinkle my nose. Lathered though, any nose wrinkling went away and I actually really liked the scent. It's almost like a sangria with a little bit of floral notes in there... oh, and menthol. It has a decent amount of menthol in it that I missed on the ingredients list. I was pleasantly surprised.\n\nUnfortunately, I didn't get a great lather out of it. It was ok after I tried a second time, but not the creamy lather that I typically can achieve. Not sure if that's related to the wine or if I was using too much water. I haven't used a LASSco soap in awhile, so I'll have to investigate.\n\nOverall though, I will definitely use this again and glad I was able to pick it up.\n",

Very smooth, very efficient, and very picky about angle. Its optimal angle is different from all of my other injectors, which took a bit of getting used to. I love the fact that it carries an entire magazine of blades inside its handle; it would make for a cool travel razor (though I wouldn't try to get it through TSA security in a carry-on).\n\nBecause of readjusting my angles and being in a hurry this morning, I settled for a 2-pass DFS so that I could get out the door and get to work. However, I just decided that this is going to be my razor for March Madness, rather than my Krona. I know I'm going to love it, but I'm pretty sure it won't supplant my glorious E2 as the King of all Injectors.\n\nAside from that, it's a rainy day, which called for my favorite rainy day scent, *Le Petit Chypre,* and my favorite rainy day record, *Temperamental.* Excellent selections, both.\n\nHappy Friday, All!",

This is from Omega's high-end line, and if it wasn't for the scent being so weak, I'd use it a lot more often.\n\nOnto the razor. You don't get much more badass than a toothless NEW RFB. Despite its knarly looks, it shaves just as well as its toothed cousin. Perfectly balanced, smooth and efficient like any raised flat bottom NEW. The blade that I said I would bin 4 shaves ago worked great in this razor as well. The only razor it doesn't work in is the NEW SC.\n\nFinished off the shave with /u/theholyblack's badass Menthol-X splash. It's the aftershave that Darth Vader would use if he had a face to shave.",

My second go with Cade Rich after reading the glowing reviews on here and I gotta say, it really sets the bar. So easy to lather and incredible cushion.\nThe Chatillon Lux I used is a sample and I can't figure out if what I have is an aftershave or toner. It's milky in color and doesn't burn too terribly bad, which leads me to believe it's a toner. Can anyone help me out? Either way, I love the scent and the way it makes my face feel. I'm sitting here 2.5 hours later and still smell it pretty strong. Very different from anything else in my den and the only way I could explain it is spicy and almost leather-like. Smells like how I would expect a 1920's rich man to smell.\n\nHappy Friday everyone!",

So since I've been using the Wolfman for a while, I figured I should use something else. The Calypso is still a very good razor! I think compared to the Wolfman, it has more feedback and a touch more blade feel to it, but overall still very good. I'd still give the slight edge to the Wolfman, though I need to do a head to head comparison or something. I guess I'll just keep both!",

Good shave this blade feels just as good as shave 1, who knows when it'll go bad. Still waiting on my L&L Unconditional Surrender it's gone from Connecticut to New Jersey which means it's passed me by for a second time.

The packaging is really nice and minimalist, kind of gives me that Apple or Mac vibe.\n\nAs for the performance, I'm not sure if it's better than Select v2.. perhaps marginally.\n\nThen again Select v2 is already very good, and CRSW is a good brand. I have an idea of the performance, it's all about the scent.\n\n\nAs for the scent, there is lavander in the background but the star of the show is a bitter citrus zest scent. The scent strength and complexity is not that remarkable but this formula excelled the most in thickness and protection.\n\n\nAs an added info, I also tried their new aftershave yesterday. It's very much like the old after shave that has a milky consistency, only in a spray bottle. I liked the old one and this one is good too.\n\n\nShout out to /u/Cousin-Eddie here you go bud, hope this review helps your question the other day.",

Brush and razor are a loan from /u/HMNbean. Huge thanks to him for accepting to part with this wonderful hardware. I feel for him now as he doesn't have anything nice to shave with. :-)\n\nMy first go with a high end brush and I'm impressed. Definitely more backbone than my Romera Manchurian knot. Something to get used to for sure, but really, really nice brush.\n\nI had two days worth of growth to get rid of, and this timeless took care of it very nicely. Interesting head design, and I love this barber pole handle. Went with a 3-pass because why not. I may have overdone it slightly on my neck so I'm expecting some irritation by end of the day today. It will have been worth it, though.\n\nBeautiful day in the Northeast again today. I'm taking my wife out for breakfast at a local coffee shop, and I smell good.\n\nHappy Saturday everyone!\n",

There's no citrus or anything like that. Seaweed, tobacco is what I pick up on but not a sweet tobacco. It reminds me of sitting on a NJ beach in the fall time. The performance is great especially for Penhaligons. Lasts all day which is saying something since most of their stuff goes 4-5 hours.",

But, oftentimes, a blade doesn't smooth out until the second or even third shave. That was the case with this Dorco Prime. It felt great tonight.\n\nThis is my first ever use of Night Music. Off the puck the smell is not very pleasant. I recall Will had mentioned Night Music to be somewhat animalistic. I would have to agree. Off the puck it smells like a wet animal of some sort. However, once lathered up the wet animal trots off to give way to vanilla and iris. I think it smells very nice when lathered. The lather itself looks like melted chocolate ice cream...I assume due to the vanilla. The top of the puck is midnight black. I'd guess it's a bad idea to use a natural bristle brush with this soap. I'd think the bristles would stain very easily.\n\nThe splash smells much like the lather and is an excellent follow up after the shave. I'm officially a fan of Night Music.",

Last night's shave wasn't uncomfortable per se, but I definitely had blade feel. Will keep this blade until I deem it's not getting any better, or it smooths itself out. Blade death row shave 1 of 4.\n\nIt was my daughter's 3rd birthday yesterday. She's ~~getting~~ so funny. Last night in the car on the way to the restaurant she said, \"Daddy, you're a genius!\" out of the clear blue. Lots of laughs were had.\n\nEdit: SOTD this afternoon\n\n* **Blade:** Gillette Platinum (13)\n* **Razor:** Wolfman WR1-SB 0.74mm on WRH7\n* **Brush:** Wolf Whiskers THBS TGN Grade A Silvertip\n* **Lather:** L&L Grooming After the Rain\n* **Post:** L&L Grooming After the Rain mentholated splash\n* **Frag:** CB I Hate Perfume [612 CB Beast](http://cbihateperfume.com/shop/perfumes-a-to-z/612/)\n\nI gotta say, I was beginning to doubt my entry of choice for the blade longevity challenge. It started on shave 7, blade still smooth but a bunch of weepers and a nick. Shave 8 reopened the nick from shave 7. Shave 9-11 were ok, but still with blade feel. Shave 12 made me decide the blade was nearing the end of its life, more blade feel, a few more weepers. Shave 13 might be the corner that is being turned. No weepers, quick 2 pass touch up from last night. Less blade feel than 12. Blade death row shave 2 of 4. Dead blade walking.\n\nAlso, if you haven't smelled any of the CB I Hate fragrances yet, you're missing out. Today I smell like roast beef.",

It's denser than I'm used to how a Paladin can feel but that may be due to the fan shape. It's brand new so it's true nature hasn't come to light yet. As it sits now I find the knot without scritch but with a nice amount of mild scrub. It feels like it will soften up nicely in time. I look forward to breaking this one in fully because as it is right now, I find it very satisfying to use. The handle material is darker in person but that doesn't make it any less attractive in my eyes.\n\nSolid smooth shave. I hope you all have a similar experience this pleasant morning.\n\n(imgur has a distinct dislike for SOTD pictures lol)",

Could also definitely be technique too. Would appreciate any suggestions on technique for slants. It just seemed to be tugging. Anyways, have a great Saturday everyone.",

It arrived in Tokyo in the middle of last week, and I decided to wait until the weekend to give it a proper try. The initial smell off the puck wasn't my cup of tea (not not unpleasant), but I could tell the scent was complex. I lathered it up, and definitely enjoyed it more.

I went back and forth between this and Barbasol Sensative prior to wet shaving. Unlike the barbasol, which was almost impossible to use with a brush, this stuff actually lathered up reasonable well with a brush. It also took in a little water as well, which seemed to improve the slickness of the resultant \"lather\". I squirted some goo into the brush, and lathered it up, just like I would with a tube of cream. Performance? Well it beat the barbasol, and maybe beats the soaps that my face reacts to, but that's about it. The cushion was good, dense and not airy, especially after knocking it down with some water. The glide was minimally acceptable, but there was absolutely zero residual slickness, and the post-shave was just terrible. I'm also not a fan of the Nivea Post Shave Balm. I know it gets quite a bit of good press as a readily available option, but it does absolutely nothing for me. Maybe if your just trying to soothe irritation it does it's job, but I put it on, and 2 minutes later my skin's drier than the damn Sahara again. If you are after moisturization, for the price of a couple of bottles of this stuff, you could get one of the absoulely excellent salves from Chatillon Lux, that smells better, will last you ten times as long as those two bottles, and work a hundred times better. That said both the shaving gel and the balm both smell good, if simple and clean. For some reason it put me in the mood for some spicy lavender, so I went with the F Black, which is an excellent budget friendly fragrance.\n\n\n\nHave a good one!\n\n\n\n**Soaps**\n\n[<< Mike's Natural Soaps - Barber Shop](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5vwjba/friday_sotd_thread_feb_24_2017/de5nwdz/)\n\n[Proraso - Green (Menthol and Eucalyptus) >>](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5w9csy/sunday_sotd_thread_feb_26_2017/de8i9am/)\n****\n\n**Tours**\n\n[Razor Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5lefc9/happy_new_year_sotd_thread_jan_01_2017/dbv6f4p/)\n\n[Brush Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5o322q/sunday_sotd_thread_jan_15_2017/dcgf5ud/)\n\n[Soap Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5q99m5/thursday_sotd_thread_jan_26_2017/dcxird1/)",

It was an awesome shave! How do you guys use the \"adjustability\" of adjustable razors? Being eager to try it out, I just used it at a 5 for all 2-3 passes, but I recall seeing some talk about switching the setting for each pass. Thoughts?\n\nThis razor's arrival also coincided with a technical breakthrough for me in my wetshaving \"career.\" Before yesterday, I was kind of flicking my wrist while I shaved. By keeping my wrist locked and moving my arm, my shave is much more comfortable and it's already helping a lot with irritation. I think what would happen is I'd feel the razor \"catch\" or engage my stubble and would unconsciously sort of panic and adjust a bit, leading to a sort of choppy shave. It's awesome that wetshaving is a skill which takes a bit of practice and something I can get better at over time. It's a great hobby which I'm happy to have picked up.",

I could have done better in a few spots, but overall it was great! I'll clean up those couple of spots tomorrow. I did have a small weeper...on my neck of all places!

It doesn't seem to be one of the more popular scents out there which I kind of like but to me it's just so fresh.\n\nHave a great Saturday everyone and happy shaving!",

Chose to skip the Stirling almond creme and give Catie's a shot, ended up adding too much water and had to go back to the tub. Got it dialed and came away with a mostly smooth shave, post shave feel is great for no animal products.\nThanks to u/TxCub5, for putting these up on the bazaar.

Second go with this brush. It's much bigger than i expected for a 28mm knot. I started with a wetter brush this time and loaded it up. Easily held 3+ passes of lather and works really well with painting and circular strokes. Flow through is really good for a big brush.\n\nI might end up finishing this tub of Darkfall. I use it almost every week because it smells amazing :).",

One of the many things I like about boars is how readily they give up lather. The brush looked clean and soap-free after the third pass. I still painted on an invisible fourth pass, and there was enough residual slickness to get the job done. Still my favorite cologne-type soap, and one of the few soaps I have a spare of.\n\nOn to the Type F injector. In a nutshell, there's no denying this shaves like an injector, unlike the Type B and C that shave like nothing else I own. Without doing a side-by-side shave, I'd say this razor is closest to a Type E, but noticeably more aggressive/efficient. I mean a lot. With that, there is a lot more blade feel and it's not as smooth as a Type E, but it's not as harsh as my Type G. It mowed through the 7-day goatee like it wasn't there.\n\nIs it better than a Type E? It's just different. Like comparing a NEW Deluxe to an RFB. They're both great, but serve different moods. If I want something really smooth, I'll pick up a Type E Cadillac, and if I want something balls-to-the-wall take no prisoners, the Type F Corvette ZR-1 would be my pick.\n\nThe Hydro-Magic finally loses its spot in the medicine cabinet; I rarely reached for it since my Type Bs and Cs are both more aggressive and smoother. The three injectors that grace my medicine cabinet are my Type C2, my Type E2 with the head that opens, and now the Type F.",

These guys are legit for hair cuts so I can understand the wait. Good entertainment though some military reserve guys came in for a cut and a shave for a ball tonight. I could totally see it in the owner's face how much he hates doing that shit. Foam from a can and a shavette I could barely contain myself but he did a really well job with the basics. I could only think how much better my shave was and how thankful I know what is better now.",

First, the Cade--dude! The supply scare forced me to put it at the top of list and I finally bit the bullet. All I can say is damn...Abundant slick Lather, some of the slickest I've ever felt. Used a bit too much, a little does really go a long way. Love the fresh, clean juniper scent and I can't wait till my Baker Street comes in to have something that carries it on throughout the day.\n\nSecond, the razor. First foray into vintage Gillettes and I have to say, I feel *really* dumb for writing them off for so long. By far the smoothest razor of *any* of the handful I've tried so far. Hot knife, meet butter. I think I finally understand what a truly *comfortable* shave is like. Too early to tell after a single use, but after some blade exploration this might just supplant my Standard as my daily driver.\n\nThe wonderful world of r/wetshaving continues to open my eyes to great stuff and I really have you guys to thank for it! Enjoy your Sunday!",

Menthol and my skin do not get along well at all. There is deep burning that starts setting in as soon as I start building the lather, and any sort of irritation will lead to instant pain. I took my time, though and still managed a three pass shave without causing issues. After about 10 minutes, the burning and redness in my skin starts to fade away and I'm left with the awesome menthol cooling effect. I so wish I could enjoy the great cooling effect without having to suffer first. Especially in the brutal summers around here. That and I really like the smell of the Proraso green, which never gets used because of the skin reaction. The performance is good, if not at the artisan level, which is fortunate because I need the most comfortable shave possible when playing with the menthol fire. Fresh and herbal scents, particularly minty notes would pair well with it. I was in the mood for the D & G Pour Homme, and the lavender/sage in that plays well off the eucalyptus and mint from the Proraso.\n\n\n\nHave a good one!\n\n\n\n**Soaps**\n\n[<< Nivea Men - Moisturizing Shave Gel](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5w3adj/saturday_sotd_thread_feb_25_2017/de78f9e/)\n\n[Proraso - Red (Sandalwood) >>](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5wfsxs/monday_sotd_thread_feb_27_2017/de9t0cv/)\n****\n\n**Tours**\n\n[Razor Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5lefc9/happy_new_year_sotd_thread_jan_01_2017/dbv6f4p/)\n\n[Brush Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5o322q/sunday_sotd_thread_jan_15_2017/dcgf5ud/)\n\n[Soap Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5q99m5/thursday_sotd_thread_jan_26_2017/dcxird1/)\n",

This was probably one of the best shaves I got from it so it should make it to 20 and beyond fairly easily.\n\nI'm also super excited because I snagged an awesome razor on ebay yesterday morning. It's a silver plated 1913 ABC pocket edition British set with the case and blade bank. It will take a bit to ship from across the pond but I'll post some pics when it gets in. For now here's the [Mr Razor link](http://www.mr-razor.com/Rasierer/Old%20Type/1913%20ABC%20Pocket%20Edition%20501%20England.JPG)",

Each has a different take on the genre, but both Marshlands and Reunion have a similarity. This soap base is pretty damn good. Excellent performance and a superb post shave feel.\n\nThis brush is my least favorite badger. I found it in never used condition in an antique store. Compared to my other badgers it's sparsely populated and floppy as hell. It's possible to get a good lather with it using a good soap, but I have much better brushes that do a better job.\n\nMan, this blade is still just humming along. I have no doubt that I'll achieve a new record with this blade. I am so intrigued by it that I don't want to use any other type of razor for the time being.\n\nGonna start my tax return today. Man, I can't possibly express in strong enough terms just how much I hate it.",

The red also has the benefit of not irritating my face with menthol. I don't really reach for this often, but when I travel, this is what I throw in my kit. As a cream tube I can just cap it up and go when I'm done with it, and it's super quick and easy to lather, regardless of the water conditions I'll hit, which makes it easy on the road. I'm also trying to hit all my post-shaves during the soap tour, and today was a good chance to use the CC sandalwood. The scent is fine, but it's pretty spartan as a balm. Feels good going on, but dries out rapidly. It doesn't have the deep conditioning properties of other balms. The Sandalood scents in the shave also gave me another chance to bring out the Graphite again. I've been waiting on another soap to come up that I could pair it with. This stuff smells fantastic, and it's number one on my list of fragrances to pick up once the future fragrance tour is over.\n\n\n\nHave a good one!\n\n\n\n**Soaps**\n\n[<< Proraso - Green (Menthol and Eucalyptus)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5w9csy/sunday_sotd_thread_feb_26_2017/de8i9am/)\n\n[Speick Men - Shaving Cream >>](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5wn0oc/tuesday_sotd_thread_feb_28_2017/debinkk/)\n****\n\n**Tours**\n\n[Razor Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5lefc9/happy_new_year_sotd_thread_jan_01_2017/dbv6f4p/)\n\n[Brush Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5o322q/sunday_sotd_thread_jan_15_2017/dcgf5ud/)\n\n[Soap Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5q99m5/thursday_sotd_thread_jan_26_2017/dcxird1/)\n",

Needed some Seville.\n\n[Prada Amber Pour Homme Intense](http://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Prada/Prada-Amber-Pour-Homme-Intense-11240.html) became one of my favorites the moment I sniffed it. It's no secret I'm a huge amber lover and this is a great one. Opens with bergamot then the patchouli comes in. Ends up being a really nice warm, slightly powdery myrrh smell. Can work with nearly every soap and aftershave. You need to shop around for it. Can be had for under $40 so don't buy it at Macy's or anything.",

I recall being like this when I first started but most of my soaps have become like old friends and it simply a pleasure to be around them. Well this pairing came courtesy of the bazaar and my heartbreaking decision to get rid of my HeV Congac & Cuban Cigars. I loved the scent but the soap and A/S burned, I was a broken man.\n\nQueue the arrival of my trade. Holy shit balls do these two items smell good. Based on the name in the past I wouldn't have given this Fine A/S a chance thinking I don't want to smell like an orange but I was wrong.\n\nThere isn't much I can say about L&L that has not been said before. I really love this scent it will soon become a favorite of mine. The soap performed great and lathered well. I still have some work to do learning how to lather this one though.\n\nMy only complaint and this is just a personal preference is the soap is soft. I am not a fan of softer soaps but I am sure that is due to my unfamiliarity with them. Once I get down how to lather them and not use to much I won't be so closed minded.\n\nI dislike Monday but hot damn did this put me in a good mood.",

Managed to do two passes without carving my face up like a turkey. Shaving sideways on my neck seemed to help a lot. I'm enjoying the Gillette blade more than the Personna so far. I was going to buy a better razor at the start of March but a medical bill may put that off another month. It's probably for the best anyways, I'm just starting to figure out this razor.\n\nHope everyone has a good one. Let's start off on the right foot this week.",

And even then, I didn't purchase Classic on that order, just the Y/R/P. My order was one of the ones that got stolen en route from Canada, and Classic was the \"sorry for the dealy, have one on me\" add-on from Ryan.\n\nFirst of all, that was extremely gracious and generous from Ryan because he did nothing wrong. Second, Classic is turning into one of my main jams, and it arrived from such an unexpected turn of events...which is, like, God's or Allah's or Krishna's provisions, man. Third, the quality of the soap and the way Ryan runs his business has earned my business going forward.\n\nSo I think there's an important message and lesson here for any would-be soapers: 1.) hook up with Shawn; 2.) have some sketchy Canadian post man jack your shit: 3.) lose money in the entire deal through production, replacement, freebies, postage, time and labor; 4) earn goodwill through the process and impress customers with the quality of your products.\n\nIt's a long game, sure. But it might just be crazy enough to work.",

In my continued experimentation with this adjustable, I did a progression of 7-5-3 on my passes today. It worked incredibly well, and I have almost no irritation. Decided I'd give the alum a try today and see if that helps with the redness that I'm still trying to heal on my neck.\n\nI've been sick the past couple days, so not experiencing all my scents as strongly as usual, which is definitely a bummer - also my nose is all irritated from blowing my nose...meh. Hope everybody has a good shave and a good day! :)",

Today I tried the Gillette Silver Blue. Simply put, I was blown away. This was by far the smoothest shave I have ever had, while also being one of the closest. I can't wait to use this blade again. I am going to try six different blades with at least two shaves each and take notes after each one. I am excited to try new blades, but it is going to be hard to contend with this one.\n",

I'm a wetshaving enthusiast from SoCal and am active on TSN. u/vigilanteSD convinced me to sign up here. LoL Today I tried Castle Forbes Sandalwood for the first time. It had the same great performance of CF Lavender which is my go-to, and makes me want to try their lime even more. I love the slickness of this cream. Just superb. Better than Nuavia, SMN V3, I Coloniali, and anything else that I can think of. Lately I've been using the above combination of aftershave, balm and fragrance and man, it is the triple threat!! It makes my skin feel and look great all day, and the fragrance is seriously amazing. I decided to up the ante from my sample and buy a whole bottle.\n\nCheers,\nEric",

Bergamot blast at first then a warm, rich combination of a sweet myrrh resin and Vetiver. Not a funky Vetiver though. Creamy is the best way I can describe it. Three sprays lasts all day and it projects incredibly well. Doesn't really share much with the original Eau Sauvage. Just a wonderful smelling frag that shares the same name.",

I think I like this batch of hair better than the Chief I have, a little bit backbone and it seems to be a little scrubbier, which is nice. I think I've lost one hair out of if so far. And for me the color is much nicer than the bright orange of the butterscotch Chief.\n\nHave an nice Tuesday!",

I used the use the SA on setting 6 though I've seen a few users comment on how you should be able to get BBS with any razor/setting. I've never gotten a BBS but I do get the same result with less chance of irritation so it's a win-win. I might try using it on 1 though I'll probably get frustrated with the angle. Today I also shaved while in the bath so it was extra relaxing.",

I believe EVERYONE should have one of these in their den, it's just a truly wonderful shaver.\n\nGot some Stirling on the way, should be here tomorrow. First go around with them and I couldn't be more excited to crack open them samples. I'm most looking forward to Baker Street, MITA, Ozark Mountain, and Piacenza, but I'm sure there will be some that'll surprise me. The hardest part will be deciding which to use first...but that's a good problem to have!\n\nHave a good one people!",

It arrived just before the tours began, so this has been sitting for nearly two months waiting for it's turn in the rotation. It's a cream in a tube, so lathering up is a snap. Pretty much the same as working with the Proraso tubes the last couple of days. In terms of performance, it feels like maybe a small step up from the Proraso creams, but in the same general neighborhood. The scent is a lovely spicy, herbal lavender. A little on the mild side, but not too weak. Anything lavender would probably pair well, especially the herbal camphorous lavenders. My first though was the Ferragamo F Black, but since it was recently in the rotation, I moved on to the Dreamer, which is a fantastic scent, that has plenty of lavender to carry the pairing.\n\n\n\nHave a good one!\n\n\n\n**Soaps**\n\n[<< Proraso - Red (Sandalwood)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5wfsxs/monday_sotd_thread_feb_27_2017/de9t0cv/)\n\n[Stirling Soap Co. - Autumn Glory >>](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5x28d9/thursday_sotd_thread_mar_02_2017/deeviku/)\n****\n\n**Tours**\n\n[Razor Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5lefc9/happy_new_year_sotd_thread_jan_01_2017/dbv6f4p/)\n\n[Brush Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5o322q/sunday_sotd_thread_jan_15_2017/dcgf5ud/)\n\n[Soap Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/5q99m5/thursday_sotd_thread_jan_26_2017/dcxird1/)\n",

I didn't want to use it against a single day's growth because these guys have a reputation for harshness.\n\nBut, I had to skip yesterday's shave, so the opportunity presented itself this morning, and I took it. And all I can say is [Daaaaamn!](http://giphy.com/gifs/noisygifs-daaayummm-r1HGFou3mUwMw)\n\nThe MMOC is super efficient and I found no harshness whatsoever. It's a very aggressive cutter with a lot of blade feel, so its lack of harshness may have something to do with the fact that I decided to use the same blade that I'd previously had loaded in my Ever-Ready 1924, which is now on its 14th shave. Regardless, it provided a great BBS shave in 2 passes.\n\nCompared to Caruso (the 1924), the MMOC seems like it has more blade feel, but doesn't sing quite as loudly. I haven't used Caruso in some time, so I may have to do a head-to-head with them to see if I can tell whether one is really more efficient than the other. The next time I shave with the MMOC, I'm also going to put in a fresh blade just to see how that changes its feel.\n\nAlso, this Stirling brush is ridiculously good. The one I bought was \"defective\" in that it supposedly has a scratch in the logo, but I'll be damned if I can find one. Rod must be inspecting those things with a magnifying glass. If you're on the fence about these brushes, go ahead and buy one. You won't regret it.\n\nHappy Tuesday, all. Another month gone in 2017.",

One pass with it on the head did an acceptable job. I rarely do more than one pass unless necessary because head nicks/weepers take so long to heal and if I can't see them well when shaving...\n\nThree passes and a little touchup did it for my face. No real complaints here except I find Schick blades to be a little rougher than Personnas.\n\nThe weight is less of an issue after using the razor a few times and my hand naturally changes the grip for the pass I'm doing. Both plates perform well with the three dot plate giving blade feel while I can't detect any with the two dot plate.\n",

The scent is extraordinary, blending green tobacco with aromatic wood and cognac. I get great billowy Santa Claus beard style lather but it dries out quickly. Not too big of a deal with a little refresh. When I use it I get a slight burning sensation but no post shave irritation. Not sure what to make of it? I haven't experienced that with any other tobacco scented soaps that I've used. Soap performance is a 7/10 but the scent is superb.",
