It took only seconds for me to remember why it was sidelined in the first place - gobbles up lather, sheds like a rabid, mangy monkey and feels like I'm using a wire brush. I'll probably use the \"pronto\" break in method at some point on it but it isn't a priority when I have other boars like the 620 and 40033 that are so much better right now.\n\nSouq. This is such a wonderful scent. The best I can describe it would be warm, baked figs that you're about to spoon over some homemade cat head biscuits. Smells soooo good. I do get some tingling from it but as long as it doesn't get worse, I'll power through.\n\nThe Rose Ispahan was something I found at Goodwill a few months back and picked it up blindly for $3. A little research after the purchase says that it's a women's frag but I'm of the mind that if I like it, I'll wear it and damn does it smell good and compliments Souq perfectly to my nose. The amber is out front but the warm vanilla comes forward as it dries down in the first few minutes, mingling with a fleeting touch of the rose which becomes stronger as time progresses.\n\nHave a good weekend!",

My nose isn't the best so bear with me, this soap lathered up very easily, and had a cologney type scent. Scents that might've been in there I would say bergamot, patchouli, and maybe oakmoss. So I guess a barbershop soap. If I could compare it to another soap it reminded me a lot of MLS the Kraken I would've thought it was it but there was no blue in it. Post shave was good and overall I enjoyed the shave. Up bright and early for a fun filled drill weekend, hopefully not too busy. Looking forward to climbing some towers and playing with radios.

Thing is, the lather dissipates, it vanishes quickly and I needed to reload thrice. If you're planning to use this with a brand new boar, don't.\n\nThe slickness is just too good, perhaps the best out there out of all those that I have tried. It's so intriguing to me, I'm planning to use it for a week straight just to see if there is something I am missing here, and if I can improve upon this one. After all, if I was able to tame MWF and Williams just fine, I am positive there is a key to this one.\n\n\nI didn't like the dissipating lather, but I am pleasantly surprised by it's slickness and post shave feel.\n\n\nThe scent of Brown Windsor perhaps is not for everyone. It's an old school scent. Like Victorian, British empire era-ish scent. It's really spicy and clovey. It's like an unsweetened ginger bread and I love it.\n\n\nReading that it was Napoleon's favorite scent intrigued me. Anything historical is my kryptonite, I'm weak for it. At first I was overhwhelmed but as I am getting used to the scent, it's becoming one of my favorites.\n\nI wouldn't wear it as a perfume, but I find the scent personally enjoyable.\n\n\n\nEdit: This was the old soap, I think there might have been a newer formula? Not sure..",

I just hope that the bulk blades actually get here sometime.\n\nIn other news since it's the 1st I can finally order some Rhapsody from B&M. I've been looking forward to trying it out for months and it was a sad day when it's release got pushed back. I'll probably pick up some seville and cologne russe to try as well.\n\nHope everyone has a good day and doesn't get pranked too hard!",

After yesterday's rough shave (mostly due to poor lather, which was mostly due to poor loading), this one was a refreshing change. Still took it pretty light, as my face was a bit torn up from yesterday, but the alum didn't leave me in too much pain or anything.\n\nI have to drive to a board meeting today and then will be busy in the evening as well. Then tomorrow I get to drive 3.5 hours to where I'll be working for the next 10 days. No time for rest I suppose. Hope everybody has a good day and good shave!",

But when the CFG collab with Zoologist came up I couldn't resist, so I jumped at the chance on release day and just got it in the mail last night.\n\nOf course off the soap it's a crazy Rum punch to the face and as many have said already, you shouldn't base your impression of the soap until you've lathered and used it. I couldn't agree more. The rum dies down quite a bit and I can smell the leather, but it's soft and not overpowering or as strong as the leather note in GLS. After that it's a fantastic combination of warm notes that aren't overwhelming like the initial rum blast off the soap. It's great and I'm really happy it didn't burn my face.\n\nLastly I almost forgot just how great CFG is and Rhino is no different. Congrats /u/chiseledface in the success of the collaboration, I'm looking forward to further Zoologist releases.",

It feels as efficient as the PSI without the initial harshness (at least in the Wolfman). Will try with the Calypso tonight. Updog seemed to be the best choice for April Fool's and F&P was the best thing in my den to pair with it.\nDecided to thin the den by like 14 soaps. I picked 10 that I wouldn't part with and the gf picked what I could keep from the rest. In total, about 13 were in the no pile so that worked out great! Cept now I have more stuff coming in so that shit needs to go soon haha.",

So, even though mine's a pre-patent model, I figured I'd shave with him today.\n\nAnd goddamn, it had been too long. This razor is 98 years old, and just ridiculously good. Being the oldest razor in my collection, every time I use him I get lost thinking about his history. But he's such a good shaver, he just takes over and basically does the job for me, singing the entire time.\n\nCaruso loves to take his time, and thrives on an actual 3-pass shave. I can get good results with him in 2 passes plus touch-ups, but he really rewards me when I slow down and do it \"right\". He's old; we're all slowing down.\n\nIn other news, *Rhino* is fucking ***legit***. Consensus seems to be to pair it with *Gratiot League Square,* and who am I to fly in the face of convention?\n\nHappy Saturday, everyone.",

At the same time I created an account on TryThatSoap and this soap wasn't ranked highly for me. True enough, I wasn't blown away by the scent. I liked the performance and this was my first experience with L&L. I still like CL balms but the soap itself wasn't for me. It's strange that in this case, I was able to tell right away that it's not going to be in my line up. Thankfully a lot of y'all like it enough for me to hopefully get something interesting.\n\nFirm believer in TryThatSoap. If you don't already have an account, you should get one.\n",

It dissipates, and I have two small weepers but for some reason I'm really liking this one, I know it's insane in the membrane but I really like this soap.\n\n\nI used my boar today, perhaps I needed the cavalry to bring this soap down a notch, interestingly it produce a really creamy consistency that was amazing as a pre-shave.\n\n\nHmm... what else should I do..\n\n\nBtw this Omega brush is still my favorite boar. The handle is nothing fancy but the knot is just perfect for me. Not floppy, not moppy and not scrubby.\n\n\nEnjoy your Sunday",

I also think I finally have the water ratio dialed in. The first couple of shaves with it, I was a little light on the water. That's not unusual for me with a new soap base. Then for a couple of days I had pushed it just a little past where it needed to be in an effort to combat the post-shave dryness, and make sure it wasn't under-hydrated. Yesterday though I cut back on the water just a tad, and the lather quality went back up. Kept it at about the same level today and it seems to confirm that as the sweet spot. I still get some post-shave drying, but it's not terrible. Of course I naturally have extremely dry skin, so it could simply be a skin chemistry issue that doesn't effect everyone. Which would explain why a subset of MdC users report it as being drying, while plenty others don't seem to be effected by it at all. If I had a full tub of this, it wouldn't be going anywhere, but now that I've gotten to know it, it also isn't really high on my priority list to obtain, especially since the Rose was an LE that would be harder to track down.\n\nAlso for today, I went back to the Barrister Reserve Spice. The pairing is very nice and I enjoyed it tremendously yesterday, so another round for today seemed like a good idea.\n\n\n\nEnjoy the rest of your weekend!",

Set the adjuster right in the middle and it felt a little more efficient than my Type-I, but still very smooth. Near BBS results with no irritation; can't complain about that! I'm sure I'll fiddle with the adjuster as I use it more, but I hesitate to change up anything when it worked so well the first time.",

I did cheat a bit and splash some on before dates a few times, and I'm happy to say that, much like its inspiration, *Agora Xyrisma* works just like the name implies.\n\nEr, *Pantie Dropper's* name, that is. It drops...oh forget it. That sounded a lot better in my head.\n\nAnyway, /u/Sammy_Lee, I know I gave you some good-natured ribbing over the violets, but seriously this is the next best thing and fantastic in its own right. This scent is so goddamn sexy, I feel like I should have been listening to Mingus' *The Black Saint and the Sinner Lady.*\n\nI recently acquired an Old Type, and decided to try it out this morning for the first time. I used the same blade that I've been using in my NEWs, which may not make for a fair first impression, but whatever. It's a ridiculously good razor. So efficient! So much blade feel! I got zero harshness from it. Just a very comfortable, very tactile shave. If the thick cap is smoother than the thin cap, then I need to try one, which is why I just bought one on eBay. We'll see how they compare when it comes in. In the meantime, I need to fix the crack in its handle.\n\nHappy Sunday, all!",

I'll try it again tomorrow with that in mind, but if i still have a lotta trouble with it, I'll pitch it.\n\nAlum seems to be helping me a lot now that I'm not letting it sit on my skin as long.

The residual slickness of the APR soap was stellar and the lather rich and protecting. Wonderful four passes and I didn't want it to stop. The Shavemac 2-band Silvertip is somehow a bit underrated at the moment. So many new vendors and knots - but this one is still a champion in my den.\n\n\n## Hope you have a great start into the new week!",

I saw one up on the bazaar a week ago, and for $35 shipped I couldn't resist. I have to say that I really, really liked it. It kept my lather warm throughout the shave, and bowl lathering (which I haven't done in years) allowed me to dial in my lather better than usual. Very happy I picked this up!\n\nPS: I made this post with /u/joelswords iOS Workflow. Made it much easier than usual. Thanks!",

But this shave it was very tuggy and it felt dull. Odd. So I popped in a Voskhod that mowed down stubble with ease and grace. LGC is such a lovely scent.\n\nAir quality is off the charts bad in Seoul these days. It's so dusty and smelly. I took for granted how clean our air is in the US. I truly never knew what pollution was until I came here. It's awful. My wife's eyes are burning all the time and my daughter is breaking out in rashes. We're seriously considering leaving Korea this year. But who knows, really...\n\nEdit: See this Air Quality Index site and take a gander at your hometown and then compare it to Korea...or pretty much anywhere in China - http://waqi.info/",

These kind of fly under the radar, but they are terrific blades for me. Nice and smooth.\n\nGlad to see the Yankees in mid-season form ;-) Great Monday shaves to all.",

I slept horribly last night. At about quarter after three, I woke up and stared out my bedroom window for about an hour, processing the weekend I just had. Then I went back to sleep and woke again at 06:30, which put me off of the schedule I'd planned for the morning. Then, I had an amazing shave. *Then* I left my wallet at home on my way out the door to work.\n\nSo...batting about .500 for a Monday. Not too shabby.\n\nThis Old Type is nothing short of impressive. /u/NeedsMoreMenthol cited it as the \"one\" razor everyone should try over in the \"One razor everyone should try\" thread, and although I don't really believe that there's only one razor everyone should try, I can't disagree with his high praise of it. It has everything: Ruthless efficiency, great blade feel and [a voice that's fucking ***powerful***.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80DtQD5BQ_A)\n\nClubman and Pré de Provence *No. 63* don't really pair all that well, but I went an entire month with no Clubman and couldn't wait any longer, so there you have it.\n\nEnjoy your Mondays, all.\n",

The scent is an interesting one that is hard to describe. It's not a bad scent, but not a great scent either. That being said, both the soap and aftershave are great.

The touch-up on the Gokumyo 20k definitely helped but I think it could use some more passes still. Loving Gold Rush, it's the best peppermint soap I've come across. It's peppermint but there is something more to it that I can't quite pin down, it reminds me of those wedding mints a little bit. The Arctique splash compliments it perfectly.",

I'm caught up, though, so I'll be spending this week playing with my big backlog of samples from all of you wonderful people. Today's shave is brought to you by /u/airbornesimian, who gave me \"sample\" of Tabac that's bigger that a Stirling sample.\n\nFor a soap that smell like old lady farts, Tabac is damn good stuff. In the words of /u/Old_Hiker, it's nothing to mess with (I think that came from OH haha). It's a thirsty, triple-milled soap that easily punches above its weight in terms of cost and performance. I fall in the camp of believers that there are too many good artisans out there to buy big brands, but Tabac could sway that belief.\n\n/u/HuckleberryKing, thanks for the frag samples. After trying Graphite today, I've discovered that pencil shavings can absolutely be sexy af. I'll have to use it a few more times to fully make up my mind, but it'll almost definitely be added to the buy-list.",

It was very tuggy on the first pass and just a bit uncomfortable and inefficient all around. I'll be trying a Voskhod blade in this razor next. /u/Old_Hiker, /u/NeedsMoreMenthol and others who take blades to very high shave counts, do you change your technique any as the blade wears?\n\nProraso Red has a nice scent - pretty perfect pair with Santal Absolut. I feel like it might have caused a bit of stinging, but I can't be sure whether that's due to the cream or the old blade. I'll certainly be trying it out again.\n\nHope everybody has a good shave and good day!",

Strange to see a smooth surface on it, and the consistency was somewhat clay like. Full marks on every aspect of performance. The scent is subdued but nice.\n\n\n\nThe balm is the true star of the show. I usually need a moisturizer after using a balm, but I think the milk/shea butter/argan oil combo really makes this cover all of the bases for me. Unparalleled post shave feel.",

So, this soap base is the stuff of legends. I swear I can load for 5 seconds with a decently wet brush, and easily lather an 8-pass shave. Okay, that may be an exaggeration, but if you loaded for ~15 seconds you could lather your whole body (I'm not trying unless you're buying me another tub).\n\nReppin' the Old North state tonight! Hoping the Heels can hold a VERY tight Gonzaga team, and secure the victory. It was un jour pluvieux today which made for a ton of programming and homework. Got registered for classes for the next semester. Should have been my last, but alas, the elective I've already taken is the only one offered when I have time, and the one announced for this summer wasn't in the catalog :(. I've gotta now attend one final FINAL semester next Spring with ONE elective (tbh I'll probably push another 'hard' class to that semester, just to make sure I've got enough to stay on campus /motivated). I keep hearing this will be a good thing. More time for personal projects, and more time to devote to an internship. Blah, ready to be outta here!",

Could not wait to shave with it. Absolutely beautiful brush. I love Grog, the soap does not smell like a regular bay rum. The aftershave on the other hand seems to go on just like the soap but get a lot of the classic bay rum spice as it dries. Not sure if I am just imagining stuff, as I am a scent noob, but that is what I notice. The T&S splash also works extremely well for me. Wonderful shave all around!\n\nedit: formatting",

This round puts the spotlight on MR to show what it's got. I set the Slim on 5 and only did two passes, not wanting to a. punish my skin too much, or b. get so close, that I can't shave again tomorrow. It really did not disappoint. I loaded for 20-30 seconds which was more than adequate for my two passes; could have easily done three plus touch ups. I got a decent but flat lather going pretty quickly but added water probably 3 times before it finally started sudsing up and then once more because it looked a little dry.\nThere's really not too much to say other than this was a nearly flawless performance. Slickness for days, zero nicks, weepers, discomfort, etc. After the shave it literally felt like I didn't need an after shave product. Probably could have walked away feeling better than before the shave. The scent is still the weakest part but I do enjoy it. In the lather, it's just a bland, nondescript clean and fresh scent. The after shave toner has a much more pronounced and slightly different scent and is more pleasant than the soap; however I'm only judging the soaps here so I don't want to focus on the AS too much.\n\nRound 1 | Round 3\n----------- | ------------\n[SdM vs MR] (https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/62cmwt/thursday_sotd_thread_mar_30_2017/dflodt3/) | [La Savonniere du Moulin](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/63k84h/wednesday_sotd_thread_apr_05_2017/dfuwphx/)",

I already adore it. Out of the tub, I get a blast of smoky vetiver with a backing note of patchouli, and in the lather that smooths out a bit, allowing the other notes to come out in a great blend. I wasn't able to differentiate most of the individual notes this morning, but I definitely want to spend more time with the scent so that I can see what I'll be able to pick out of it.\n\nThis was my first go with a T+S soap, and its performance is really good. Many others have written much more eloquently about it than I, so I'll just say that it hits all the right beats in terms of performance. The Aftershag is super nice, too. My face feels fantastic right now. Its scent is just about the same strength as the soap when lathered.\n\nThis Old Type is also a ridiculously good performer. It has exactly the right amount of blade feel for me, while still providing a smooth, efficient shave.\n\nHappy Tuesday, all. Off to get my kiddo ready for the day.",

When I cracked open the jar, and even during the initial lathering, I was quite sure I made a mistake in purchasing this. It smells like straight murder fresh off the puck. Or as my wife noted, \"like a sweaty wino.\"\n\nVery strange, strong, and persistent scent that calms way down fairly quickly, and about an hour later, I'll go ahead and say it smells great.\n\nBut it definitely takes the long way to Goodsmellsville. And its route goes first through Ewwsburg, Goddamnington, and the Village of Nope.",

I guess my subconcious mind is telling me that I have options, so here I go again looking for something else.\n\nTo think I have been using Gillette canned goo gel for years and years without getting bothered by the scent, I didn't even think about it at all. I just hated the whole thing, the expensive cartridge and how I must try to prolong it for 3 months.\n\n\nB&M latha figgy toner, the scent is very festive and joyous. Sweet but not too sweet, it's just right. Smell delicious, I'm actually craving dessert right now.\n\n\nShannon's soap is nice. It's slick and pretty cushion-y. I like the scent of the Silk Pajamas soap, it's mild, a bit perfumey and feminine but very pleasant to the nose.",

Ended up coming back home at 1am, and woke up at 3:30 when daughter came to ask for an ice cube in her water. If you're on the east coast today you know it's raining like hell. I normally don't mind but today I would have taken some sun.\n\nC&S 88 represents everything I like about wetshaving. A soap base I love (Valobra), and a scent I'm very fond of (rose!). Lovely rhodium finish on the super adjustable. Little light for me but still a great performer.\n\nThe toner is a straight rose custom from /u/hawns. Smells delicious. For those wondering, it's exactly, exactly like CL Yuzu Rose Patchouli, except that it doesn't have the Yuzu and the Patchouli. :-)\n\nSorry I'm tired. It's going to be a loooong day.",

Scent is nice, a little light and a little powdery but very pleasant. It smells somewhat similar to Unconditional Surrender to me. The splash was so drying that I followed it up with the Unconditional Surrender balm and the scents complimented each other perfectly.",

New soap, new razor, new blade. I've been looking over the soap list from last year's June Challenge (lather games) trying to slowly make sure I'll be mostly covered when it rolls around this year. Obviously there will probably be some line up changes, but I figure if I can cover the last one, it won't be to hard to adjust the final list. The one big hole in my line up was that I didn't have any french soaps, outside of the MdC sample I'm almost done with. PdP gets a lot of love, is readily available, and inexpensive, so I picked one up and it came in yesterday. From a single test use, it seems to make a damn good lather. The shea butter does a decent job of boosting the post-shave feel. All in all pretty happy with it. Scent is a kind of generic fresh soapy lavender, but very mild and easy to layer ontop of. Decided to pair it up with what has become my go to jack-of-all-trades splash which is the BR Classic. I noticed today I've already taken a good chunk out of my bottle.\n\nThe other new items were the R1 and the GSB blades. They seemed to be a damn good combination. That was probably the smoothest, easiest ATG pass I've ever had. I don't know if it was just how the razor and blade were performing during the pass, or if they did such a good job on the first two passes it just cleared the way for that final ATG pass. Either way I ended up with a good shave. It does seem to have a tad more bite than the V3A when the angle is off, but when it's on, it's as smooth as butter. I need a few more shaves with it though to lock it in. I was finding myself fiddling with the angle a lot today trying to get a feel for where that sweet spot is. Good razor though, and very glad to have it. Feels like it's going to be a really good daily driver type razor.\n\n\n\nHave a good one!",

Got the Sherlock set when Rhino came out to support CF and get a shipping break. I find his base works the quickest for me. I am a big fan of Santa Paula and GTB. Sherlock lathered up smells different off the puck. Off the puck I always got the earth/dirt smell. Wasn't always a fan of that smell (Why did I order Petrichor? LOL) It faded away and the rest of the notes popped out. I'll keep using it. I think it will be one that grows on me.",

This lather is really something, even when run thin and over watered it seemed to hold it's slick form. Post shave is fantastic leaving a slippery film that was great for quick touch ups.\n\nThis frag is lovely, I really need a matching set to go with this. I thoroughly enjoy the use of more pepper and a more earthy Lavender. Can I suggest some ass milk? :D /u/WhollyKaw, /u/Hawns",

When my alarm went off at 4:45 am to go running, I had to dig deep. I checked on my daughter. Her fever was gone, so I got out of bed and hit the pavement.\n\nFor today's shave, I decided to use Monaco Royale, which just arrived yesterday. I was very excited to use this soap based on all the rave reviews. This is the first soap I've ever used with Donkey Milk. The scent is great (Lavender, Bergamot, Neroli, Petitgrain). During the shave itself the soap performed very well, on par with my other top tier soaps. I'll need to experiment more with water content to get more slickness out of this soap. After the shave, I had zero irritation and my skin feels fantastic! Maybe there's something to this ass milk after all! Chatillon Lux TSM Fougère is the PERFECT splash to pair with this soap. So great!!! I look forward to using this pairing more. Awesome shave today!!!\n\nHave a great day everyone!",

Unfortunately, I think Shag is a miss for me. It opens up smoky, which I don't think my brain can wrap around for a soap, and I don't like smoky scents to begin with, anyway. Once lathered (and after a few minutes the Aftershag is applied), the scent brightens up with the bergamot and lavender which makes it more enjoyable for me. Unfortunately it's still not my cup of tea :( As much as I want to enjoy it, I'll probably have to let it go, considering there are soaps I *really really like* and am letting go of. I'll give it one more chance, though.",

I don't know about you guys but as much as I love the scents from Fine the formula itself doesn't do too much for me. Even considering I always apply Thayer's WH before any aftershave splash. I barely touch my Fine AS's once we're out of Summer. Once these are done I'm probably not gonna buy them again except for American Blend. Wish they would add more things for your skin to their formula. Water, alcohol and menthol just don't cut it for me unless it's hot out, really. Anyone else feel the same way?\n\nBut! B&M's great formula is doing good for me today. Also, probably gonna stick to the V3A all week. Gotta use this great razor more often.",

I saw this first in a couple YouTube channels and decided to test it out myself, so I don't claim originality on the idea. I normally don't, but I bloomed the soap for only about 30 seconds under very hot water, had the brush soaking then wrung out completely. Poured out the \"Bloom water\", then placed the brush on top of the soap, swirled 3x, and this was enough for a very comfortable 3 pass shave.\n\nThought it'd be fun, and I may be doing this to prolong the life of some of the more limited release soaps I've got. Not sure if some of the more plant-based extracts are being picked up loading this way, but at least I'm getting a descent lather.",

The Voskhod seemed both inefficient and rough. After doing three passes, I realized there was still quite a bit of stubble left, so I did another. Surprisingly, that pass didn't cause any problems...so I don't know what to think of this blade. I think tomorrow I need to slow down a bit and refocus or something.\n\nGood scent combo today - Latha Sandalwood and Mountain Man both have a pretty high currant note to them, so I figured they'd pair well, and they certainly did.

The same goes for Mike's soaps - I was fortunate enough to discover them very early on in my wet shaving journey and I still believe they are one of the best out there. It all resulted in a wonderful lather and a perfect smooth shave.\n\n\n\n## I hope you enjoy your shaves!",

I don't know if I like it or not. I don't hate it and I also don't love. Off the puck to me it smells like hot dogs. The concentrated smoke and earthiness remind me of hot dogs for some reason. Once lathered the smoke really dies down and you get minor lavender notes. Going through the shave I was able to pick up a lot of guaiacwood. The aftershave again has a strong smokey scent up front but is immediately punched through by the bergamot upon application. Once again the guaiacwood starts to poke through.\n\nVery unique scent. Right now I'm leaning towards it not being for me unfortunately.",

This round puts the spotlight on SdM to show what it's got. I set the Slim on 5 and only did two passes, matching what I did yesterday with MR. It also did not disappoint. I loaded for 30 seconds and then started face lathering. It seemed a little thing and dry, so I went back and loaded about 10 seconds more. It is probably the combination of the 2\" puck plus the hardness of the soap, but I had a really hard time loading. If I were determined I'd keep it, I would probably just press it in a plastic tub. Once I started lathering, it seemed on the dry and fluffy side, but once I was sure I had enough soap I slowly started added water. This is another pretty thirsty soap and I was able to get a usable lather after adding more water. Even though I wasn't incredibly happy with the lather, I got impatient and went in anyway.\nThis soap is such a great performer and there's a reason I've always used it as a benchmark for every soap - well maybe not a benchmark since I don't expect them to stack up, but more like a gold standard. Once again zero nicks, weepers, discomfort, etc. One thing I did notice once was that the blade almost seemed stuck and was not gliding against my skin. I didn't like this, but only noticed it once and on the next pass it didn't happen again. After the shave it again felt like I didn't need an after shave product, although my face was noticeably dryer than I remember it being with MR. Much like MR, the scent is the weakest part but I still do enjoy it; such a clean, fresh, classic smell.\nI'll wrap up with final thoughts tomorrow.\n\nRound 1 | Round 2\n----------- | ------------\n[SdM vs MR] (https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/62cmwt/thursday_sotd_thread_mar_30_2017/dflodt3/) | [Monaco Royale](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/63cu5s/tuesday_sotd_thread_apr_04_2017/dft6jkz/)",

Both the Shag and the Dior showed up yesterday. Tallow + Steel nailed the scent for recreating that vintage 1969 smell. Herby and patchouli heavy, with some smokiness. A good take on the classic hippie vibe. The citrus and resinous myrrh from the Dior actually complement it very well, and take the whole thing to a place that is a little more office friendly.\n\nHad a mostly better shave today. When I was doing the first pass, I had forgotten that the baby had given me a small scratch on my jawline last night. The raised skin from that was raised up just enough that it got shaved off this morning :) Small quick sting, but it was just a little skin, not even enough to produce a weeper, but it was a shock when it happened. Other than that I felt pretty good with my angles this morning, no drastic fiddling, just some constant subtle adjustments. Again the last ATG pass was just exceptionally smooth. I'm going to push this GSB to see where it takes me, but I'm curious to get one of my 7 O'Clock blacks in, to see how much is the blade, and how much is the razor. Either way I'll likely be picking up a larger stash of the GSBs, as they seem to work great with this razor.\n\n\n\nHave a good one!",

One pass with the grain and the second against the grain. Great shave over all. DFS quality for sure. Cold River Soap Works is great soap by the way.\n\nHope everyone has a good one!",

The shave was *alright* yesterday probably because I'm not used to the weight of a SS razor, this Wolfman has a bigger blade gap, and this is a new soap base I haven't done a test lather with. Whoops. I think I'll revisit the soap again this week with a razor I'm more familiar with. As for the razor, I'll use something from L&L tonight and judge how I like this weight/blade gap. That said, Awesometown smells great and can only be improved with some sharp/zesty citrus of top, though I'm sure the decision not to had good reasoning. I think there's just some cognitive dissonance on my part when I smell passionfruit that's not a little tart, haha.",

Again, after blooming the soap under hot water for just a minute, I was able to get a very descent lather with just 3 seconds of loading. But the post shave was not quite as impressive, I'm sure the longer loading would pick up some of the more nourishing ingredients that don't make their way to the surface.\n\nBut overall, a great, close shave in just two passes. I forgot this AS splash has a crazy burn and cold to it.. I just wish they were still in production :(",

I think I need to bite the bullet, buy one, and practice like fuck. I just don't know how much water to use in them.\n\nThe Tuscany smelled pretty nice on the sample, didn't change very much on the lather, flowery and kind of woody. It's dried down on my face pretty nicely, the wife says I smell very woody which made for some great bad jokes on my part. It was a nice shave, very slick, I didnt feel any tugging and I did an atg pass with no irritation.",

I'm an effort to circumvent this, I took it easy yesterday, but with mediocre results. So today I brought in the big gun (for me anyway), the .74. Funny thing about this head is it's still just as smooth as the .61 OC, near as smooth (**really** close to) as the Ti .61 SB, but more efficient. This resulted in getting most of the problem hairs off, and **minimal** irritation for the scenario. I'll see later if it was actually effective. Aside from that, a damn fine shave!!!\n\nHappy hump day everyone =)",

I have no idea how I'm supposed to shave under the chin since my jaw bone protrudes lower than my skin. I didn't strop the razor either since that's what is recommended, but my strop is still MIA anyhow.",

Not at all comfortable in this razor. The Astra was a bit better, but it seems like something's up with my NEW. I had it all figured out just a few days ago, and suddenly it seems like I can't coax a comfortable shave from it. I dropped it a few days ago and thought everything was fine (none of the combs bent or broke or anything, and I couldn't see any dents or cracks), but now it looks like the blade exposure is uneven between the two sides. Not sure if it was like that before, but I feel like I would've remembered it. I can't think what would break or bend that would cause that issue without my being able to see it. Unfortunately, it's the only razor I brought along with me to the hotel, so I'll have to try and figure it out.\n\nHope everybody has a good shave and a good day!",

This town smells of passion fruit with some florals and spice. Seems these people care about their town. Alright enough about the town, lets talk about the soap. As B&M mentioned on his FB page, this soap doesn't need much water. With that statement, I decided to take a different approach to my shave today. Completely rung out my brush, and started loading up. Easy to load, as per the usual with B&M soaps. The scent notes become more prominent once I started loading, with passion fruit taking the lead. To my nose, I didn't catch any of the sandalwood or ylang-ylang. Once I was finished loading, started face lathering and slowly adding drop of waters. I maybe added half the water I would normally add to a B&M, maybe even less, and I had a superb lather. Performance wise, the soap was slick and protective. I think I would still prefer the white label over this new base, but it's a great base none the less.\n\n\n\nI would highly recommend this soap to anyone, especially those who likes citrus/fruity scents. This isn't an over the top sweet scent but the passion fruit is definitely the leader in this soap. If this ends up being the base for the Reserve soaps, I will most certainly be picking those up.\n\n\n\n**Have a great shave everyone!!**",

It exploded everywhere, it immediately surpassed the amount of lather thIs INCREDIBLE brush is able to contain. That's fine. The shave was great, I love me some Cade rich, GLS is a soothing fragrance and the face feel of the CL aftershave products are all awesome. I think it's the last shave with that blade, perhaps I'll swap heads on the injector and see how another one feels.... Off to work, there is a tornado warning until 8am so I'm sure the drive to work will be just great.... have a great day everyone, and a great shave. :D",

I have come to the realization that Boellis Condotti smells just like Chrome by Azarro. Which isn't a bad thing. Chrome smells wonderful.\n\n[Lacoste Blue](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Lacoste/Eau-de-Lacoste-L-12-12-Blue-11044.html)\n\nI thought I was mostly done with frags but I keep finding more. I've had this one a bit but would usually keep it in my car incase I needed a fast freshening up. It's alright. Nothing special or unique. Just your run of the mill sporty Cologne. Citrus then Woods with a little Spice. Performance is on the lower end of things. Unless you find it for dirt cheap or happen to love the generic Sport frags I'd say do not buy.",

I wet my brush, shook out the water and took it to the puck. I don't even think my brush had touched the soap and there was already lather pouring out of the jar. I face lathered without adding any more water and it turned into a fantastic lather. I love the scent, actually really like the lack of a tart scent with the passion fruit. I enjoy the smooth sweet smell. The CL toners are just fantastic, moisturized the crap out of my face and smelled beautiful. Hope everyone has a great day!",

Completely different than anything else I have tried from BM (haven't tried Passiflora). The scent is great, and the base is very different than Glissant. I like Glissant, but I often find myself reaching for a base that lathers quickly. This base does that and then some. It may not be quite as good as Glissant, but it is worth the trade off IMHO given how effortlessly it lathers. Hope everyone on the east coast stays safe with these storms rolling through.

It's a very fruity and fun fragrance that is sweet and delicious. Got a great refreshing shave from it. Balm was a little more mentholated than I would have liked, it took about 10 minutes to settle down to where I could smell the scent again. Do not regret this blind buy. Also, props to SC for the handwritten note and free sample - always a pleasure when artisans go above and beyond.",

There's a chance of the rain turning to snow overnight (gross!) so I wanted something that reminded me of summer and with baseball season having started, Diamond was the obvious choice. GLS pairs really well with Diamond, and Original Vetiver rounds the whole thing off nicely. It's something I wish I had a full bottle of, but considering the price, I'm happy to settle with the 30ml decant I got for $30 last fall.",

Indeed, when I got to the bathroom I even set it on the counter. By the time I got out of the shower though, I was just in the mood for Hallows. I think part of it was that I was frustrated with the lacklustre shaving experience over the past few shaves. I shave twice a week and after you've racked up a string of shaves that aren't satisfying for 1 reason or another, it's a nice feeling to fall back on something you've tried and loved. Which was kinda weird since Leviathan is a B&M product and performance wise should've been just as good. I just wasn't in the mood to chance the scent. It's also a good reminder of why we \"save\" on cartridges - so we can spend double (and even triple) on other stuff that vastly improves the entire shave experience.\n\nSo yeah - great experience today. Leviathan up next.",

I have Passiflora, so a quick comparison would indicate that they certainly could be 'soap siblings' but they aren't the same. My nose indicates a more subdued smoother type scent on the SoA, while Passiflora to me is more sharp. Both amazing scents.\n\nThe lather was creamy, slick, and amazingly effortless to create. I loaded it like any of my other soaps, which is with a moderately damp brush. The lather burst from my brush and we were ready for action.\n\nI got an amazingly close shave and it just seemed right to finish it all up with an AdP type aftershave. I reached for the Fine Italian Citrus, but for some reason changed my mind at the last second and went for the RR XXX. I was happy with my choice.\n\nGreat all around shave and the sibling rivalry that is Passiflora/SoA is sure to please. Good day gents.\n\n\n\n",

K Shaveworx performed well, as usual. Definitely one of the nicer vegan bases on the market. As for the scent, notes are leather and Taitian Vanilla. At first it was a touch sweet for my liking, but the dry down was nice, and my wife liked it a lot, which makes it a keeper.",

For some reason in my mind, I had built this up to be some radical new soap formula, and was a little hesitant for fear I would mess up my lather. Not the case. It is subtly different. I'm glad I saw the warnings to ease back on the water. My default is to load with a fairly dry brush, so that didn't change, but I pushed a lot less water than normal before it made that shift to creamy, sheeny lather. It never, or only briefly experienced the airy whipped state that signals more water. Something in the base is latching on the water that comes in and not releasing it. Makes for a super slick glide. With one use though, it's hard to say if it's better or worse, but it is slightly different than the normal Glissant.\n\nI like the scent. It doesn't feel like a world changer, but I really started my first collecting phase in the fall, so I have a lot of heavier fall/winter soap scents. This one however, is squarely in the spring/summer camp, so it adds a good option to my arsenal. It's like a creamy tropical fruit punch, with hints of florals. Very pleasant if not an immediate head turner. It did make for a good choice on a warmer spring day, and I could see it being one that grows on my slowly. I saw somewhere Will mentioned pairing it with Spice. The sharp sweet spices are a nice counterpoint to the creamy sweet fruits and florals. I took that and pushed a little further with the Jubilation. Pleasant smells all the way around.\n\n\n\nHave a good one!",

I had never heard of these guys before, so I figured I'd give it a shot since it's been a while since I've checked out an up-and-coming artisan.\n\nThis stuff is really good. The scent doesn't have a name, so it's just *Soapmakers of Awesometown.* I guess it's their only scent, which is kind of a bold move given the deluge of scents that are available from other artisans. Still, its good enough for Speick and Tabac, so why not? It's a very pleasant blend of passion fruit, lavender, sandalwood, citrus and ylang-ylang. Out of the tub, the passion fruit is very strong, but it mellows a lot once the soap is lathered. When lathered, the bouquet becomes a nice mellow, floral sandalwood with hints of the passion fruit still in there, and the citrus notes giving it a bit of brightness. It pairs really well with *Yuzu/Rose/Patchouli.*\n\nThe base is excellent as well. It loads like greased lightning, lathers easily and checks all of the performance boxes. I don't know where these guys are sourcing dragon tallow, but I hope at least it's legal, ethical and humane, like from a dragon liposuction clinic or something. At any rate, it's an excellent soap, and I'm looking forward to trying out future scents from these guys. I hope they do well.\n\nEnjoy your Thursdays everyone!",

I'm just sitting here shaving with a classic all jealous. My shipments feel like they've been en route forever. I've had this giant 8oz soap for a few a years now. I don't care for the scent off the puck but lathered it smells pretty good. I sort of want to say I prefer CBs' older formulas. There's something in the toner that burns a little but not enough to toss it. Brush is candidate for a Declaration Knot. The TGN knot it came with is scritchy and meh.",

I'm a big fan of fruity or floral scents so when I read the description I knew I had to have it. You definitely need to use less water with this new formula but the slickness and protection is top notch. I find that the scent strength is a bit weaker than other offerings but that's not always a bad thing.",

This Chubby is a touch Scrubbier than other I've used that made for a nice exfoliating shave. The lather is woody and quite pleasant. It smells like something I've come across before but I can't recall what that was. Nice post shave that was followed by a nourishing splash. Taking /u/La_Yerba_Mate 's advice I treated like a CL splash and applied wet to avoid the sticky feeling. I'm pretty happy with this stuff, I'll have to use it one more time before finalizing my thoughts.\n\nBBS-1 is love, life, and it is endgame. Get one.",

Initially, it was very patchouli forward with a lot of smoke. While I still get that that once lathered, I get a lot more of the sharp citrus from the bergamot. I was a bit iffy when I first smelled it, but once it opens up, it's a lot more enjoyable. I don't find the aftershag that much more overpowering than the soap, but will see how that goes throughout the day. Probably don't need to say much about the Hucklaration brush other than if you don't have one, you should probably get one.\n\n",

So I am thoroughly stoked to have it in my hands now.\n\nIt is frankly remarkable how much this soap smells like wet dirt. Like, it *really* smells like a tub of mud in the most delightful way possible. So cool.\n\nI got just a sample of the aftershave and I'm now kind of glad I did, as it doesn't really smell the same as the tub. Less earthy, more... almost powdery. Not sold on it yet, and I figure I can still get a bottle if I fall in love with it.\n\nAlong with my new tub of Petrichor, I also received my Soapmakers of Awesometown, and I finally ordered full tubs of Reunion and Spitfire, too. All in all a good haul.",

Trying to get in the routine of knocking out one of these each day I shave/have presence of mind/enough time to work it in.

Cologne Russe definitely smells warm off the puck until you lather it, where the citrus comes out and brightens it up a little. I'm really enjoying the scent and it's my first tub of the permanent offerings in Glissant. It's been awhile since I used glissant so I need to play around with the water again to get optimal sickness -__- also Armada Blossom is great but my face burned\nIs it by the alcohol or the fragrance who knows? I did mix it with a little moisturizer so idk. I'll probably dilute a little bit of it in this unscented CL toner I have and see how that works out, but I definitely need to use it more lol.",

I thought I loved the glissant base, but whatever Will threw together in here was on a whole new level. The ease of lather was mind-boggling and the slickness was like nothing I've ever tried before. I had easily one of the best shaves I've ever experienced this morning and can't believe how smooth my face is.

I get the passionfruit, but something (I'm guessing the sandalwood and ylang ylang) helps it smell more masculine than just straight fruity. Performance was good, but not quite a slick as glissant. That said, it's still very good. I would say it was similar to Soap Commander in regards to performance.\n\nThe GEM G-Bar, or heavy duty flat top, was an interesting razor. While it felt much more mild than my 1912, I did get a weeper and it wasn't as efficient. May have been an off day, but I'm going to revisit the 1912 and switch back and forth for a few shaves. The g-bar does definitely feel better in the hand than the 1912.",

Smelling the dry puck, my nose picks up mostly vetiver with a waft of patchouli. Smelling the AS bottle, I find the opposite to be true. When lathered, the patchouli scent comes out more and evokes a memory from my younger days when I used to go camping and wake up in the morning to the scent of smoldering logs. Unfortunately, the scent didn't last long on me, 15 minutes max, so I might have to move this one to someone else.",

Nonetheless it is nice change of pace from the usual in your face and exciting scents from artisans here.\n\nWoah the performance is like boom. A 3 seconds load enough for 2 passes and the more water you add, the more the lather grows. Crazy stuff.\n\nThanks to all those who patiently answered my question on MdC one or two weeks back :)\n\nEnjoy your shave and enjoy your day people !",

BBS-1 is one serious razor and it means business. Not the mildest razor around, but it's efficient like nobody's business. It deserves the high regard and more.\n\n\nMy Hydra is probably one of the first shaving soaps I bought; It's hardened a bit now but still performs like new.\n\nCushion-y, protective and slick. The scent is still there btw even if I have the habit of drying my pucks overnight.\n\n\nL&L's liniment is just as great and also unusual. The only balm I know/tried that has tallow in it's ingredients. With L&L in mind, it's also unfortunate that Scott has discontinued his alcohol-free toners, I really like those as well. :(\n",

I wasn't sure I would like it compared with the stainless models, but it gave me the smoothest, easiest, and closest shave yet. I am not sure if it is due to the lighter weight or dropping down in agressiveness from the H1. I will have to order a stainless R1 plate to eliminate some variables and complete a true showdown.",

Picked it up due to its performance in u/airbornesimian march madness.\nThis was use numero uno with the hucklaration - still gotta work out some of that badger funk. But it's a beautiful and great brush and it'll be interesting to compare with my Washo once they're both broken in.",

Add *Clubman Classic Vanilla* to the mix, and I'm sexy AF today. Which is good because I'm having lunch with a lady friend, and I need to bring my A-game.\n\nI took delivery of a thick cap Old Type yesterday, and it's just as good a shaver as the thin cap version that I have. Supposedly this one should be smoother than the other, but I can't really tell at this point. Looks like we're going to be doing a head-to-head soon d(\\^_\\^)\n\nHappy Friday, everyone. I'm hoping that mine remains low key.",

I am loving this Hucklaration brush it was really soft to my face, nice and scrubby. First pass of SoA went great, second pass too much water so I reloaded and started over with a much thicker lather. Picked up Spice at the Seattle Shavecon last year while visiting Will's booth, first time actually using it and it's really nice. Almost bought the Classic cause I wasn't sure about Old Spice scent but Will's mom said she liked Spice better so I went with that. Luckily during the raffles towards the end I won a bottle of the Reserve Classic and already having a good supply of Floïd Blue I'm just waiting on that Fern and Lavender!",

It worked! It didn't turn the Fine splash into Barrister's Reserve or anything but it definitely made an improvement here. Doesn't feel as drying as usual. Skin feels less tight and dry. Instead it's more moisturized and relaxed. It'll make it easier for me to finish up the 4 bottles of Fine I have (AmerBlend, FreshVet, Plat and O Noir). Still though once these are done I don't see myself buying any more of these besides American Blend cause that scent is one of my absolute faves. I'll find alternatives for the other scents but with much better performance.\n\nHappy shaves and enjoy the Friday everyone!",

Great scent and performance as expected.\n\nI'm not a fan of the Maggard synthetics. I know the price is right, but the performance isn't there. The 24mm is way to bulby. The 22mm is closer to what I'm looking for, but they both are typically synthetic--fickle with water and terrible at splaying. I've tried to like them, especially the black 22mm, but the Fine 20mm is just a better synthetic brush.\n\nAfter going through a lot of blade samples, I'm back down to just Voskhod and Astra SP. Voskhod used to be my golden boy back when I shaved with a DE89, but it doesn't work as well in my Wolfman as does the Astra SP. So now Voskhod only see the light of day when I'm using my New SC & Aristocrat 16.\n\nDue to an error in Amazon's wishlist system last Christmas, I'm the proud owner of 2 bottles of Speick. For some reason, I feel compelled to use the product more often when I have multiples.\n\nMy chin area was feeling a bit worse for the wear, so I dusted off the Gentlemen's Refinery balm. I bought this stuff based on the TSN \"best of 2014\" recommendation. It's a bit too much like milk--I prefer my balms to be viscous--and at $40 it's way overpriced, but it does what a balm is supposed to do.\n\nMy birthday was a couple of weeks ago. I dropped some hints that my Knize Ten is running low. My wife didn't know it has to be ordered from Europe, so I ended up with Light Blue instead. Reminds me of Davidoff Cool Water. I prefer more a more manly scent, but it smells pretty good.",

Probably not the best match (leather?) but I picture a hippy wearing a leather headband, flashing me the peace sign, and it all works out. Very good shave today! I missed the sign up but am going to have to find some Shag.\n\nIf anyone wants to sell theirs hit me up! :)\n\n[Peace out!] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aZsF7v0pNw)",

Still didn't strop yet. I had my first cut under the chin during the second pass, probably since I still don't have any idea how to do XTG under the chin. ATG pass on the edges of the lips are a little rough since it's hard to control the angle and sometimes the blade digs into the little follicle bumps and gets stuck. Overall it seems like a closer shave than the first time though. My skin always feels super dry even after the Nivea and I always have to use lotion - not sure if that's normal or not.",

Less water was key. I have a bit of heat on my face after the shave - I think that might be because I caught a bit too much sun working outside without sunscreen though...\n\nTrying out another Atelier Fragrance today. Not really a matching pair with any of my shaving stuff, but I won't be putting it on for a little while after anyways. It is a pretty nice floral scent mostly, which is appropriate enough as today was the first time I really saw the sun in the past three days, and it was pretty gorgeous out.\n\nHope everybody has a good day and a good shave!",

Best shave I have ever had in the few months I have been at it. Would recommens Rhapsody pair to anyone who likes how the scent is described on the website, for it is bang-on.\n\nBesides that, really have been happy with Treet Platinum's. Not the most common brand, but I find them better for me, with the exception of Feather blades.",

The brush is all I wanted and more in terms of feel, looks and softness and I'm quite blown away by it.

As always, performance was top notch and the scent was very complex. It had a lot more floral notes than I expected and I think it will take me a while to break it down.\n\nLa Quatrieme Ville was another recent purchase after my new found love of vetiver scents. I get a lot of cedar, but it is a fresh/green cedar scent. It reminds me of trimming cedar hedges as opposed to the rich spiciness of seasoned cedar wood.",

It's very evocative. A fine recreation of the scents I remember from little league, or trips to go watch MLB games. Around 15 years back, I worked a 9 month contract in a building right across the street from what was then Pac Bell park. I took the Muni in to the office, then after work, I would grab a cheap last minute ticket from the sea of scalpers, and head in to watch the Giants play whomever while I had some garlic fries and a few beers, [staring out into the bay](http://www.ballparksofbaseball.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/attv5.jpg). Then, I could just catch the Muni straight back home. Afternoon games were also good. With the walkway out over the bay that wraps around the park, I could take a break and walk around and watch an inning or two through the grating in right field. Grass and dirt and sour beer. The slightly sour beer on the puck almost lends the airs of well broken in athletic equipment. The tiniest touch of leather might be very appropriate with all this. Once lathered though, it blooms into a slightly sweeter beer aroma, that puts you squarely in the stands. I don't get a lot of the carmel and popcorn, just some very subtle sweetness that seems to run through it. Good stuff. Not a wearing fragrance, but a pleasant nostalgic scent. Reminds me of those days at Pac Bell Park.\n\n\n\nHave a good one!",

First run with it I was super surprised with how quickly it loaded soap (much more backbone than my other synthetic). It also felt great on my face, the only thing I have to get used to is that it is a smaller brush, but hey that may make me buy some more from mr. /u/andrewpalombo",

This stuff is the best performing cream I've ever used, beating out Cade in all categories minus the post shave which isn't quite as good. The balm went on easily and absorbed quickly leaving my face without that greasy feeling that some products create. Scent is mild and pleasant, nothing amazing sadly.",

Does anyone else think that this razor head/handle combo looks weird? Maybe I just like the colors matching..\n\nAnyway, this go around with SoA was loads better with less water. As I slowly added water, it went from a sticky paste to a really dense (and still kinda sticky) lather. I actually stopped here despite me really wanting to add more water, because last time when I took it to where I thought it should be, it wasn't so slick. This consistency reminded me of shaving with canned shaving cream and yet it was so slick (though it did clog the razor more easily). I told /u/bostonphototourist about it and he said it could take a some more water than that, so I'll make that adjustment next time. I'm still so confused haha.",

The General is a much better shave experience over the RR Black Hawk, it's just too aggressive for me. Still prefer a DE around the mouth area just because it's easier to maneuver but I am getting a hang of this one. It's nice just swiping a huge area at one time with a large rigid blade, if I ever start shaving my head this is what I'll use. MR5 handle is great and looks very sexy, feels good in the hands and is just the right heaviness. Hucklaration Tortie is da bomb diggity, so soft and scrubby with a great handle. Now to the software, Petrichor lathered up with a real nice earthy smell. I always loved the damp earth smell after raining it's so fresh and clean. Paired it off with my Zoologist Bat sample, real nice earthy fruity scent, damn I smell good. Off for a nice prime rib dip sandwich a few cold brews. Cheers!",

Preforms as expected for a B&M glissant base soap and is a very complex earthy scent overall.\n\nThe aftershave also works well, but the scent is definately on the weaker side. Have yet to decide if I would want others to smell me smelling like rain, so this is probably a good thing. It is definately a safer option, so I understand why.\n\nI think I prefer Rhapsody overall, but Petrichor is still an excellent scent that I will certainly keep in my spring scent rotation. Very impressed by both products.\n\nAnyone who likes the idea of the two scents should buy the whole set. It is worth the asking price. I got free shipping by adding a bottle of Latha aftershave, just a tip. I am interested in how it will compare, plan to use it in tomorrow's shave.\n\nHappy Saturday all. Best of luck with all your endeavours, shaving and otherwise!",

It's close and it felt super smooth, though I did catch the corner of my mole, causing it to bleed just a bit. One thing I'm learning on this trip (where I've brought just a couple soaps) is just how much difference it can make to really get dialed in with a soap base. These past couple shaves with the Latha base have been excellent. I want to get a tub of the Latha Original - seems like it'd be up my alley.\n\nI bought a sample of Drakkar Noir because it was one of the only fragrances I'd really recognize the name of before I started to get more into them. I actually like how it smells quite a bit. My sample is almost gone, and I could see myself going for a small bottle of it. It's pretty strong and recognizable, so not something I'd want to wear out all the time, but I think it would be a nice one to occasionally throw on.\n\nHope everybody has a good shave and a good day!",

High tide at 11:22 tonight.\n\nVery nice scent on Scylla and as usual the Dragon ain't nothing to mess with. Smell reminds me of The Kraken, I would put them in the same boat in that respect, but as far as scent goes I would have to go with The Kraken.\n\nHave a splendid Sunday!",

      "body": "###[New Soap and Brush Day](http://imgur.com/a/n3lXK)\n****\n\n🎼 **Prep**: Stirling Soap Co. - *Tuscany*\n\n🎼 **Razor**: Above the Tie - *R1 on Atlas*\n\n🎼 **Blade**: Gillette - *Silver Blue* (6)\n\n🎼 **Brush**: [Paladin Shaving - *26 mm Select Fan, Cobalt Beehive Handle*](http://imgur.com/a/0jKDT)\n\n🎼 **Lather**: Barrister & Mann - *Rhapsody*\n\n🎼 **Splash**: Barrister & Mann - *Rhapsody*\n\n🎼 **Fragrance**: Rasasi - *Daarej Pour Homme*\n\n****\n\n\n\nI'm not really sure what to make of this Rhapsody. The scent off the puck is a minimal hint at what you get upon lathering. And all of that is a subset of what comes through with the splash. Is is good or is it bad? Neither really. And not in a middle ground, it's just sort of ok way. It's like it is no longer on the measuring scale. I guess the best word to describe my reaction is: confused. *Generally*, that's a good thing. The last thing that did this to me at this level was *Grey Flannel*. It took a long time me to unravel and appreciate that one, but working for that appreciation means it is now in the pantheon of fragrances I'll never be without. I have similar hopes for the Rhapsody. It is certainly not dropped out with that crowd pleaser, simple pleasant scent. It is complex. There are subtle, discordant, angular things happening underneath, that reblend with other things on top to reharmonize. It demands your attention to take it in. There's lightly sweet florals, and some sharp aromatics, some citrus that refuses to be overly bright. Something powdery and lightly earthy underneath, something that smells old and antique, but it's so far on the outer edges and it's hard to focus on. Again. Confused. At any rate, this set is going nowhere. It's not often you get a chance to enjoy these types of sensual puzzles, and I look forward to unravelling it. The last couple of days have seen petrichor and diamond. Extremely well done evocative scents. Those take an expert craftsman a long time to perfect, but once delivered, they are simple and straight forward to enjoy, because they are so familiar. They are exactly what they claim to be, and the joy is in the end result, and how well it represents itself. Rhapsody is another animal all togother. The same amount of craftsmanship on the back side, but then the complexities are laid out bare for you to interperet, not just enhale and enjoy. The joy for these is in that interpretation.\n\n\n\nOn to the new brush. This one is exactly what I was hoping for when I picked it up. It's similar to the first beehive, but dropped a couple of mm lower. This one is a scrub monster. Not a massaging luxurious experience. It has a lot of backbone in the middle, from some stiff hair. It takes it all the way up to the point of being scritchy, without actually crossing over and being scritchy. This is something I've been looking for, since I don't like scritchy, but sometimes want a really good scrub. This is not an everyday brush, but one that will come out when I need or am in the mood for, that really good scrub.\n\nHave a good one!",

Had a little trouble keeping the correct angle, which was surprising since the angle came naturally for face shaving. I ended up with a nice shave but I don't think my NEW DeLuxe will be replaced as my go-to head shaver.\n\nThe Type-G just came in the mail last week, so I wanted to give it a try on my face. It seems just a bit more aggressive than the I, but very similar. Still comfortable and smooth despite a subpar lather (I was trying to use what was left in the brush after the head shave but probably should have reloaded).\n\nHave a great week fellas!",

DE89lbl\n* Blade: Treet Platinum (1)\n* Post: Cold Water\n* After: Latha Oceana\n\nGot to try out my free shipping bottle of Latha Oceana. It is getting into the low 90s and I am going to be outdoors a lot today, so an aquatic scent seemed suitable. Overall very impressed with the preformance. I think it is only slightly inferior to the main line aftershave, and for $8 this is a fantastic produce. Would recommend for those who want an affordable workhouse aftershave. Seems to spread a bit more easily that the alcohol based stuff too. Just make sure to shake it well before use, as oils? float to the top after it has been sitting for 30 minutes or so.\n\nLove the second time with a blade. Smooth whilst still having close to the sharpness of a new blade and none of the roughness of an old blade.\n\nGreat shave overall. Happy Sunday!",

I've tried wet brush, dry brush, distilled water, hard water, lathering for extended time...a TON of different approaches and I can't make a shiny lather with this soap. After a foamy stage, and lathering for an extended time, it calms down and is slick, it just won't get shiny like every other soap. It still shaves well, it is just hard to tell if it's ready or not. So strange...*shrug\nA quick 2 pass again to make sure all the irritation I caused last week is all the way gone. Good enough for a lazy Sunday!\n\nHope everyone's weekend is going well!",

I think I may have been drowning my lathers a bit before these past couple. I have made a conscious effort to add less water to both my Latha and this Proraso and have been rewarded with a nicer shave, especially in the slickness department. I know this won't apply to all soaps - as I have already found Stirling soaps seem to be able to take all the water - but a good reminder that all do not perform the same with similar amounts of water.\n\nHeading off to meet an online friend in person for the first time at his house for dinner - it's kind of awesome having friends around the country, especially since my job takes me all over the place!\n\nHope everybody has/had a great day and great shave!",

It seemed to have a grainy effect on the top layer of soap. I prodded it with my finger and it was really soft to about 7mm down. The consistency was really soft and it felt grainy too. I'm guessing it was due to being left wet? I scraped it all off and went from there and it seemed fine. Bit unusual though.\n\nThe Pro blade in the General was better than the Super. Much better in fact. Very good results although still not favourable over the Alumigoose yet. The last of the 3 shaves will tell.\n\nHave a good day people.",

I think because of the density of the Declaration knots, the 27mm version works better for me than the 30mm in my Franklin. So comfortable and luxurious to use. It will be interesting to see what it feels like once it's fully opened up.\n\nI picked up a sample of Seville a long time back. At the time, I chose to pick up a full tub of the Cologne Russe over the Seville, but always had it on the back burner to pick up at some point. Since I was already making the large order for the latest B & M releases, I went ahead and threw a tub in to go ahead and cross it off the list. It seems like it will make a good spring and summer option. This is the point where I realize I don't have a lot of good citrus fragrance options, and in fact, have a pretty heavy fall/winter centric lineup. I may have to break the embargo to pick up a few things and fill in some gaps.\n\n\n\nHave a good one!",

It is very much luxurious. Aside from a woman's caress, this is the softest thing I've ever had on my face. Yesterday and today, 15 seconds of vigorous loading has produced enough lather for at least two shaves. I don't know if that's the brush or the two soaps I used, so I'll experiment further to see how that works out for other soap bases. It's a hefty investment, but well worth it. Get in on the sign-up if you're able.\n\nIt had been a while since I'd used *Green Dragon,* and the soap had been calling to me. Dapper Dragon ain't nothing to mess with, I'll tell ya what. This boy is going to be in the rotation much more often now that the warmer weather is finally here.\n\nHappy Monday, all. Time to start the week.",

The scent is a winner (for me). Mango and Pineapple are some of my favorite fruits so I wasn't too worried about the scent. The soap performs just as well as some of the larger artisans out there. This was my 2nd go with this soap and the first time I over hydrated the later (still a good shave) but today I nailed down the lather. Slick, yogurt-y lather. /u/Fahrenheit915 you did a great job with this soap base and I'll be looking forward to your next one ;)",

I shave daily and I found that my WTG pass wasn't really doing too much for me. Lately I just start with XTG and go ATG then finish. I'm happy to report that this has lessened my irritation with blades that would not normally agree with me (still sampling more blades). Happy Monday!",

The end result was a damn fine one pass shave. I attribute that to technique I've developed since I started, not to that cheapo razor. What strikes me is how cheap that razor feels now. After two years of mostly vintage Gillette use the MTO is light and the doors are creaky. It just doesn't feel good in hand. It did give a fine shave but I'll throw it back under the sink and maybe drag it out again next year if the doors even function then.",

First, I was just too busy/exhausted. Then I let the box containing my razor & brush get buried in the garage. So I was getting pretty furry.\n\nThen it turned out my trimmer charger cable wasn't in the same box as my trimmer, and the battery died halfway through shortening the beard.\n\nSo, I ended up having to try taking the whole 2 weeks beard off with the Mongoose. Which shouldn't have been a problem...\n\nExcept my blade gave up the ghost on the second pass, and I had to change blades mid-stream.\n\nUltimately, I did 4 passes - 2 with the grain, one across, and one against.\n\nAnd despite it all, I actually ended up with a very comfortable, near-BBS shave. Not even a whisper of a twinge from the Vigoroso.",

Sunny and mid 70's today.\n\nNice shave today in the end but I re-solidified why I barely reach for my Semogue 1800 lately. The lather I get when using this brush is just more airy and I prefer denser and creamier lathers. Still got nice slickness out of it though so the shave wasn't really hurt by it.\n\nHappy shaves everyone!",

First time using this brush and it's seriously the perfect balance of softness, backbone, splay, flow through... it hits all marks. If you don't have one you need to get one. The Amber handle is stunning and it feels great in hand. Easily my best purchase in 2017.\n\nToday I used an Asylum Rx for the first time. I have Classic and King Cobras in my rotation so I thought it would be fun to compare the Rx. A few quick impressions: Very well built. Clever blade holding mechanism that is much more solid than the Cobras. The handle feels like a Tradere. Real nice. Its finish is brushed. I wish it were polished. The blade angle feels different than the Cobras... more aggressive or at least on par with the Classic Cobra.\n\nI'm also really stoked on the T&S Vide Poche soap. It smells sooo effin good!!! I wish there was a re-release of this soap. I'd stock up!\n\nHave a great day everyone!",

First off the Alpha Ecliptic is a nice slant, angle was easy to find right away. The head of the top cap feels as though it needs to be in contact with your face. Need more time using it, but it didn't give me any trouble, and ended up with a BBS.\n\nSoA. Loaded it longer than usual, and used less water, I got a nice lather out of it, but is sort of dissipated on the 2nd and 3rd pass. It was still very protective and slick however. Post shave feel is really nice, but sadly it burned my face. Prepare to see this one on the bazaar.\n\nGreat day lady's & gents!",

It was a really nice subtle pleasant scent combination. I also used my new Polo for the first time. I was a little concerned that the handle size would be a little awkward but it was perfect. I am completely in love with this brush - http://i.imgur.com/t5s9Erp.jpg.\n",

Another shave another cut, this time on the left side under the jawbone during WTG pass. Had to use the nick sealer this time since it was kinda bad. I wasn't paying attention to the heel or the toe when it nicked me.\n\nI'm surprised about how well the razor shaved considering I got it off ebay and honed it myself on Norton 1K/8K and a knives plus strop block w/ green compound. I wonder if I'd notice a difference if I added a finishing stone and a real strop in there. I started incorporating the usage of a towel for wiping off the blade and face and it seems like it'll probably have a permanent place in the routine. I feel like having a wet blade makes it stick to the face a bit, and it's nice to be able to fully wipe off the alum.",

From what I've been reading the past couple days, it seems like Latha Sandalwood might share a bit of a basic structure with Soapmakers of Awesometown. Fruity topnotes with a creamy, sandalwood base, though I imagine the Latha comes in a good deal sweeter with the amber accord in there. Thoughts from anybody who's smelled both?\n\nHope everybody has a good shave and good day :)",

Usually I would go for one of my slants - and now I know why. This was the first time, the Wolfman didn't behave anything but spectacular. It struggled during the first pass - there is no use in sweet talking it. After that, everything went back to normal and I had a wonderful shave with a silky smooth end result. The APR soap resulted in the wonderful and rich lather I have come to expect and the scent is as always out of this world.\n\n\n\n## I hope you enjoy your shaves!",

I never have an issue with brushes drying but this guy takes forever. The last use of the hardware today and the passaround is over.

Just a smooth and effortless shave every time. Seriously considering getting it replated as while it's in great shape it could use a little TLC.\n\nI told myself I wouldn't buy anymore B&M unless it was in the glissant base, but after trying a sample of Cheshire I had to. The scent is absolutely incredible and I quite like the white label base. I had just bought this Colonia from CL so decided to give it a whirl. The scent is bright and perfect for spring/summer, and the feeling on my skin is nothing short of magical. This shave is a 10/10 all the way.",

Me like.\n\nThe real star of the shave is the Oliva formula. This stuff is like a mutant cross between L&L Bison and SV. It started as a thick dry paste but turned into a thick goop with plenty of water making for some seriously slick stuff. The post shave was also impressive. My face is smooth and hydrated. Suck it Tuesday.\n\nPleasant shaves.",

The highly floral Hummingbird on top actually goes fairly well. I love the florals, but the sweet honey may be a touch too much for me. We'll see how it develops and softens as it dries down.

This stuff is such a good performer, it could easily be a 'one and only' soap. Bonus points if you enjoy the scent (I do).\n\nI'm starting to think that this knoot has magical powers. 15 seconds of loading and I still had what appeared to my untrained eye enough lather for 2 entire shaves. In fact, it looked to be exactly the same amount of lather I got from *Green Dragon* yesterday, and *Bandwagon* the day before. I call shenanigans.\n\nI also call this the best brush in my den. Sorry, all the other brushes. I still love you, just not quite as much as I used to.\n\nHappy Tuesday everyone.",

Today I specifically chose to use it as a send off with the intention of selling or PIFing it afterward.\n\nI loaded the blade and tightened the handle, but this time I thought to myself, \"chrisx4, maybe there's been some blade play in the past... you should probably try tightening the handle a bit more just to really make sure it's locked in there.\" To my surprise, I got a full quarter turn more out of the handle and I could feel the blade kind of bend into place.\n\nNormally I try to be gentle when tightening a handle so as not to damage the base plate, but in this case I was being way too gentle. The handle felt tight, but obviously there was room to crank it down a bit more.\n\nNow admittedly, the resulting shave still wasn't the best, but it was on par with what I usually get when I'm trying out a new razor for the first time... and a million times better than any previous Standard shave. I'll have to start the \"new razor exploration\" process all over again.\n\nI'll stop on the way home from work to pick up some of the rubber washers others have mentioned to protect the base plate.",

I really need to get more than 4 hours of sleep. I had a nice run on a moonlit beach. I swear I smelled Shag at some point during the run. Maybe a hipster camping out on the beach..? LoL\n\nI used an ASD2 (on loan) today. Sooo freakin mild with hardly any blade feel. This razor is not for me. It was hard to get a clean shave in my chin area. Maybe 5-6 passes and I'm still feeling stubble. The L&L soap performed very well and was very forgiving. :D",

First time using my R1 that I just got yesterday. Did a quick 2 pass shave today and I can already say I'm happy with my purchase! It's nice and efficient like a V3A. But still very comfortable and smooth. Doesn't feel harsh or anything like that to me. Think I'll be using this plenty alongside my Rockwell, Variant and Featherweight.\n\nAlso down to my last little bit of Glissant based Seville. The good thing is I have a tub of White Label Seville on the way that still has 90% of it left. This last weekend there was a little chatter about preferences over White Label vs Glissant and later that night I just happened to peek into the Bazaar and saw this for sale. I've had a couple of white label tubs before, but over the last year I've become a much better wet shaver overall so I know my lathering skills are better than they were back then. Will definitely study the differences between this white label, the Glissant Rhapsody I have and also the different base Awesometown uses.",

The brush is just getting better and better with every use, granted, tabac never disappoints me.

Still didn't strop it, but no cuts this time! Still using the towel to wipe the lather off the razor instead of rinsing - seems to work well. The Stirling brush seems like it holds a lot more lather than the Muhle STF (24mm vs 21mm) but I think I like the face feel less. Or maybe it's all in my head and my Muhle preference is due to its aesthetics? I'm not really about the brown hairs and the STF hairs look way better, but objectively the Muhle brush feels less slippery in my hand but of course the larger brush feels fuller and is easier to load/lather as a result.\n\nI kind of gave up going XTG under the chin and just started doing two ATG passes instead. Shaving under the chin is hard all the time, but luckily I don't really have too many hairs there. ATG on the upper lip is still difficult and I had to do a quasi-4th pass on that area. I think I dislike the flex of the XH blade when I'm doing my chin area, but we'll see. This time around during the ATG pass I correctly started from the top of my face instead of the bottom to prevent any awkward lather smear issues. Alum felt OK, but not as good as the best DE shave I've done (admittedly not many).",

I've read about them a few times, but haven't given it a go myself until today. It was very comfortable during the shave - perhaps too comfortable. I think it prevented me from feeling any fuck-ups as much, until I rinsed off of course. Not saying I lit my face up or anything, but perhaps would have felt a bit of irritation before it was too late.\n\nI think the cold water also muted the scent of the soap to a degree. It seemed like the higher notes stood out a bit more over the base notes than normal. Maybe that's just in my head I dunno. It's definitely something I'll have to play around with more.\n\nI also experimented with the combination of B&M Latha and Proraso Sandalwood. It didn't do the scent any favors, which tells me that the B&M soap is just a well-balanced scent. The addition of some straight sandalwood didn't make it better. I also think it hurt the quality and slickness of the lather a bit. Oh well, I was just trying to use up the last of the Proraso sample, but also wanted to shave with the Latha once more before I go home and it gets put up for a while.\n\nThis blade is sorta starting to show its wear a bit. took a little bit of extra work to get the hair off I think. I'll probably just toss it tonight before I go home for simplicity's sake.\n\nHope everybody has a good shave and good day!",

It has been hard for me to find an aftershave that matches the wonderful herbal notes of Seville, so I was really looking forward to trying Fourth and Pine. Unfortunately, this has been thet one Chatillon Lux product that I am not a fan of. I love the initial scent, but after 10 minutes all the lovely citrus is gone and I get a toasted nut/corn smell. I will have to try it a couple more times to see if my initial experience changes.",

I know it can vary but just looking ballpark.\n\nAlso, still experimenting with blades and I just got a really good one with the Lord Super. I haven't seen it mentioned a lot here but man I had a smooth shave this morning. May have to do a side by side with a feather (my current favorite).\n\nYall have a great day!",

For some reason I bought this soap thinking I'd use it during the winter. We didn't have much of a winter this year so the soap got ignored. Great post shave feel. There's some guys over on B&B that use only Haslinger and nothing else. I could think of worse things to do.\n\nI believe it's looking like I may hit the 100 mark with this blade. Only 12 more to go. I've had a few shaves with this razor and I'm going to switch it out again and see how it does in another favored razor. Wednesday awaits my attention.",

It was great sample, and if it was readily available, I might pick it up just because the scent on it is so good, but it's not enough for me to go tracking down a tub somewhere. I went with some odd pairings for it today. Spice with the floral rose is good, but I wanted to give this Civet a wear. I wasn't sure going in exactly what to expect, or if would go with the rose and spice at all. Probably not the ideal pairing, but it's not bad either. They don't conflict at any rate, it's just that the heavy spice somewhat interferes with picking up the subtleties of the Civet. Good stuff all around though.\n\n\n\nHave a good one!",

I started with a kit from Maggard's and today is the first time that I have gone back to their London Barbershop soap. I loved the scent when I first got the kit and love it still. But soon after I started wet shaving I got caught up in the exploration of all the different soaps out there. I hadn't been back to the Maggard's soap since. Truthfully I'm not sure I like \"croaps\" if you will but it lathers great and quick and I got an amazing shave today. I didn't need to make the extra 2-3 passes over my trouble spots. Really got a nice close shave with minimal passes and no irritation at all. I had gone back to the Maggard's soap today with the intention or giving it a once over and seeing if I should put it up on the bazaar. But after this shave it's not going anywhere. And truthfully I am a little surprised that the Maggard soaps don't get much love here.\n\nEnjoy your jump day!",

In my opinion, however, they're nothing special. I shaved the way I always do, nothing special (mostly because I have two brushes, and one razor, so the only thing I change is the soap),and it performed worse than my favourites (Treet Platinum, Wilkinson Sword, Astra SP) but better than what I hate (Derby Extra, Big Ben) and without the irritation that other mid performers give me (Silver Blues, 7 O Clock Yellow, Feather). I'll give it a few more goes, but so far Ive no opinion.\n\nDoing night shaves and off days recently. My face is worse again after a very clear period. I stopped using my salicylic acid toner because I was clear and now I'm breaking out again. So I can only blame myself.\n\nSaw an all male production of The Importance of Being Earnest last night. It was hilarious, inventively staged, and the changes (the Bruiser Company added songs and a score) were great. I think they overstate Wilde's narcissism (everyone was dressed as wild and added extra costumes on top of the Wilde costume to differentiate characters), but it was a very enjoyable play overall.",

The scent reminded me almost instantly of my years as a gardener and led me to try topping it off with Grey Flannel. The combination of violets and dirt was incredible! My wife loved it and said that I smell like a garden, which is exactly what I was going for. Today was also my second time using Shark Super Stainless blades. (Thank you to /u/Fahohlee for introducing them to me!) Both shaves with them have been incredibly smooth; they pair wonderfully with my Gillette Slim. I believe they may be my new favorite!",

This is the vegan formula before bison hit so I haven't tried AtR in bison yet. I am guessing pretty close scent wise minus the tallow smell I pickup from my other L&L bison soaps. Really love the after shave for this because of the vodka in it, I don't know if it's that or some menthol but it chills the hell out of my face and opens up my sinuses like nothing else. Unfortunately the ATF didn't like Scott mailing vodka without a license so it was discontinued..",

Very easy to lather, slick and with good protection. You take all that and factor in this wonderful scent, it's a keeper. It's been 4+ hours since I shaved and the AS is still going strong; wonderful vanilla scent with a spicy sandalwood background. It's one of my favorites. Have a great day folks!",

Finally home and get to try out all my new software goodies that showed up in my absence. Figured I'd go with Night Music tonight. First of all, I definitely see how people can be turned off by this scent - and how they could call it \"poopy\" even. Personally, I found the scent interesting and, while I wouldn't say that it smells super good right off the puck, once lathered and then with the aftershave, it is a multi-layered and delicious scent that I'm glad I got my hands on.\n\nThis is also my first time trying the glissant base, and it was a bit of trial and error. At first I ended up almost instantly drowning the lather. Combination of too light of a load and too much added water I'm thinking. I went back for more soap and then didn't immediately add enough water, so it was sorta trying to dry out on me. Once I got it though - holy cow that slickness was off the charts.\n\nThe Maggard Slant feels so efficient and nice after using my Gillette NEW for two+ weeks straight. Only went with a quick one pass shave so I should be able to try something else out tomorrow! Probably going to go with Rhino.",

Totally worth the hype. It's one of the slickest soaps I've ever used. It smells a bit different off the puck than lathered. Unconditional Surrender worked nicely (and is awesome), but I chose that based on the scent off the puck. Once lathered, it actually reminded me somewhat of Barrister Reserve Classic, so I think that's what I'm going to pair with it next. That being said, Unconditional Surrender was so nice, I used a spritz of the frag this morning, which also goes nicely with today's pomade choice, O'Douds Winter Stockist Offering.",

There was a thread about them a few days ago (I think in the Simple Questions thread?) that got me thinking about them, and I broke out my 1912. What a wonderful razor. Not only did it give me a great, smooth, irritation free shave, it looks beautiful too. It has this cool \"Art Deco\" handle that I've always loved, and something about the SE head shape is appealing.\n\nAlso used Petrichor for the first time. Damn, what a great soap. It honestly reminds me of Roam. Not that they're the same, but there is a relationship there--more in the soap than in the aftershave. I think the aftershave will compliment the weather well today--it's a warm-ish spring day, with sun shining and birds singing. Can't think of a better scent for it than this.",

I'm glad I felt better today because I really couldn't wait any longer to shave. A big thanks goes out to /u/schickter for making this shave possible - I hope you are enjoying things as much as I am. I smell glorious and I feel pretty good. It's gonna be a great day and it's almost Friday.\n\nAlmost forgot - /U/UbaldJr deserves a big thanks for sending me a sample of YRP (among various other premium goodies) a while back to try.

The Hucklaration decided to hide a lot of that from me, but what I was able to talk it into releasing still gave me a fantastic shave.\n\nSpeaking of fantastic performance, the Astra blade is back in the NEW SC this morning. Like time, this blade seems determined to march inexorably forward without pause. I did not detect any loss of efficiency from it this morning; it just sailed through the stubble with ease.\n\nStay strong, all. One more day.",

After it was over, I held off a little longer since I knew I'd need to place an order for some bath soaps at some point in the near future. Earlier this week I was down to my last two bath bars, so I placed and order, and picked up the Baker Steet at the same time. I never had the original Stroppe Shoppe soap. I know its the same FOs, but I can't comment on how much stronger the scent is. For me, it seems plenty strong enough for shaving soap purposes. It's a nice sweet creamy scent, with a strong juniper note. Grounded, but still fairly bright. Made a great pair with the Equus, which has plenty of juniper on its own. Potential downside is that I seem to be having a bit of reaction to the splash. The soap didn't seem to cause any issues though, so I'm a little puzzled. Doesn't seem to be causing redness or swelling, just a long lingering sharp burning. Not intense, but there. Will see how it develops.\n\n\n\nHave a good one!",

It's a little strange using a brushless cream, but the slickness of the cream is great and it left my face feeling wonderful. The scent of No. 63 is also very nice. I can see this being a great option for traveling, which is one of the main reasons I picked it up.",

This is a very nice razor that I've been eyeballing (admittedly just because of the color scheme) for a while now. I generally don't care much for aluminum razors because I have a hard time not applying pressure because they're so light. I'm happy to report that this one I don't seem to have any issues with. Unlike the Standard it feels a bit more substantial, and less aggressive to my face. I don't get as much audible feedback but that doesn't seem to be an issue. Overall shave was wonderful, much better than I had mentally prepared myself for. Petrichor is one of those soaps that the scent just struck a chord with me from the beginning. I've owned the Tre Citta version for a long time and have always hoped for a re-release with a splash and now my dream's come true. If I had to complain I wish the scent on the splash was a little stronger, but frankly that's not the point of a petrichor type scent... it's supposed to be light. I really love this scent. As for the brush, this thing has rapidly become a favorite for some reason. It was just something that I turned for fun out of a scrap chunk of acrylic that was a little small for much else. I tossed in an AP Cashmere that I had laying around and boom, fantastic brush. Funny how that works sometimes. Happy Thursday everyone!",

Off the puck I get mostly some really punchy rum and a bit of leather. When I read \"rum\" as a note, I expect a sort of sweet molasses note, maybe with a bit of spice. This just smelled super boozy and sweet - I was shocked by how much it actually smelled like rum straight out of a bottle.\n\nOnce I got it lathered up, the scent was not quite as sharp, but still very strong. This is a very well put together scent - I had trouble parsing different notes out of it during my shave. I got some more subdued rum, leather, a bit of smoke, perhaps some vetiver - altogether a very masculine fragrance. I'll definitely need some more uses to unpack the scent some more. Performance was very good, as I expected from the couple of Chiseled Face soaps I've used before.\n\nI definitely want to pick up the Zoologist sampler at some point, hopefully in the near future. Thanks so much to /u/jdubba for the PIF - I love this stuff, and I'll try to make a point to keep the PIF train going sometime down the line here!\n\nHope everybody has a good shave and a good day!",

Although the scent wasn't bad it wasn't for me which is why it's on its way to a new home. The brush is great for a synthetic and beautiful to look at. The Polsilver is doing great no loss in quality, just smooth shaving. Hope everyone has great shaves.",

What I heard about the blackbird is true, it is not incredibly forgiving with pressure. If I accidentally used any force, I could feel a bite. I would suggest this to someone looking to really perfect their technic.\n\nIn terms of the soap, I seem not not be getting the lather I'm used to with LASSCo soaps. No matter what combination of load/water amount, nor time lathering seems to get me a thick lather. But for me, a descent lather is not one that looks pretty, but is protective, comfortable, and slick, and this still shines high above most in those areas, so I can't complain. Overall a good shave.",

The W&B has a super uneven bevel that I haven't bothered fixing, but that doesn't seem to affect the shave. $11.13 shipped was a pretty damn good price for it! Still didn't strop. I got another cut on the left side of the neck during XTG but probably wasn't watching the toe again. I think I like FH better than XH since the XH flex is rather confusing to work with around the chin.\n\nToday is the first time I experienced \"exploding lather\" while loading the brush. I think it was due to dripping slightly more water than usual on the puck itself. I'm starting to understand the brush more also - it is way better at making lather when I don't FULLY push it against my face but still splay it with my chin. I took another look at why the Muhle brush doesn't slip in my hand and the Stirling brush does, and the answer lies in the bottom of the Muhle handle's more pronounced bottom lip.\n\nI've kind of given up on doing ATG on the upper lip and decided to just do a more ATG-y XTG pass from the other side and the results seem fine. I seem to have figured out the left side of my chin, but the right side still isn't as close as a DE shave. Alum was quite alright with the exception of the neck cut.",

I placed my order at 3:00 in the afternoon on Tuesday and received my delivery today (just 48 hours later).\n\nThere are several different scents available and as a first time buyer I chose just one scent that jumped out to me. The scent I chose is called Strengthening and according to the website it is \"a blend of Rosemary, Frankincense, Peppermint, Spearmint and Lemon. Has a fresh, minty, herbaceous scent with a camphoraceous, woody undertone. This stimulating blend helps sharpen mental clarity and awareness. May provide an extremely mild cooling sensation from the natural menthol content in the mint-based oils.\"\n\nI actually love this scent. It is fresh, crisp, clean and even a bit antiseptic smelling. In my options this is a great warm weather scent. And great for a wake-up shave.\n\nThe soap can be purchased as a standalone 3 oz. puck for 7.50 or as a 6 oz. tub for 17.95. Matching witch hazel based aftershave splashes are available for $11.95 for 4 oz.\n\nAs for performance, the soap loads and lathers amazingly fast and voluminous. Seriously light years faster than any other soap I have ever tried. I'm guessing that's the mainly glycerin base (I was surprised to see the soap was translucent when I first opened the tub). Also it was by far the slickest soap I've ever used as well. I know these sound like grandiose claims but I am seriously impressed (enough to write my first review).\n\nThe aftershave splash was nice and refreshing and toning as well.\n\nI truly am impressed by this soap from its Amazon Prime like speed of delivery to its performance and lasting smell.\n\nI highly recommend checking Em's out if you're looking for a new soap to try.\n\nI've linked a few pics of the just opened tub, the initial brush load and after about 30 seconds of lathering.\n",

Using the Diamond was great, really a wonderful soap that reminds me a lot of Roam. Obviously they're different, and I could smell the caramel sweetness and slight acidity of the beer in Diamond, however, at the end of the day, it really reminded me a lot of Roam, which is why I ended up using the Roam splash.\n\nThe disappointment came in due to the irritation I got out of the shave itself. I don't know if it's because I shouldn't have gone against the grain, I don't know if it's because I just get a better shave with SEs on days where I haven't shaved for at least 48 hours, I don't know. I did end up scratching up I face pretty good and some of my sensitive areas. Even have to end up using my I alum block to calm things down. And that's also why I went to the Roam koyvu instead of the alcohol splash.\n\nI think I'm going to stick with SEs for awhile, though, so we'll see.",

It was my first use of this brush. This handle is a piece of art and was a pleasure to use. It feels great in the hand, is well balanced with nice weight. The tuxedo knot is probably the best that I have used and was perfect for face lathering. I decided that it deserved nothing less than MFRoam for its inaugural shave and of course, the Roam delivered. The La Quatrieme Ville compliments the Roam nicely and is a wonderful product. It was a wonderful shave for this Good Friday. Have a great day folks!",

Reef Point definitely doesn't get enough love. I'm going to have to put his stuff into my rotation more heavily so that I can help fix that.\n\nI gave the Hucklaration a break today so that I could test out a new brush that I received yesterday from /u/drivenlegend. It's quite lovely, and I really enjoy the face feel of the knot. It hogged a bit of lather this morning, but definitely feels like it'll break in nicely. The handle is very comfortable, too.\n\nHappy Friday, all. I'm ready to be done with this fucking week.",

Trumper Spanish Leather\n\nI visited Maggard yesterday and picked up a couple goodies! Did I need them? Not necessarily, but I wanted to go there and smell stuff, which of course leads to buying stuff. Case in point: Diamond. I had seen it and read all the notes and everything, but I didn't really think it interested me. I smelled it in the store and ended up walking out with a tub. I can smell grass and a bit of earth and a notable sweetness. After having used it once to shave, the notes seem to kind of meld together and create an aroma which (to me) smells like an overripe, perhaps even rotting, banana. I like the scent, but it may end up on the bazaar - undecided! Performance was choice of course.\n\nAlso my first go with a Rapira Plat Lux. It seemed to work decently well in this razor, though I haven't done enough blade exploration to know whether it's better than others really.\n\nLastly, it's my first time using this Chiseled Face aftershave that I picked up in a swap a couple months ago. It was the closest thing I had to a match for Diamond - it has earth and leather, and I figured the tobacco could be all that chewing tobacco business going on ;P It had a much bigger menthol kick than I thought it would, and also burned a bit more than I expected. Perhaps I'm slightly sensitive to something in it. The scent is excellent though. Kind of classes up the vibe Diamond started.\n\nEdit: Added Frag. Figured I'd continue the classiness and throw on a bit of Spanish Leather. Love the first five mins of this fragrance, the rest is pretty nice. It doesn't have great longevity, but I can't seem to get any bites for it on the bazaar, so I might as well use it. Still up for sale if anybody wants it!\n\nHope everybody has a good shave and a good day.",

Sure it's a tiny sample tub, but it still feels good to actually finish something :) Unfortunately nothing has changed since the my initial trials with this soap. The Grand Havana causes me some burning. Not a face melter, just enough to be uncomfortable by the third pass. It's too bad, because otherwise I'd be putting a full tub in my den, as it smells fantastic. I think I may grab a tub of the pomade. Same great smell, no uncomfortable skin burning.\n\n\n\nHave a good one!",

I started the lather with fairly wet brush, but not dripping. It started out foamy, airy and dry, but with some time and slowly adding water, ended up with a nice shiny lather. It was a little on the thin side, but plenty slick! The notes are Elami resin and Javanese canaga blossom oil. I have no idea what these are supposed to smell like on their own, I've never smelled them before haha, but it is what seems to me like a fougere, but a little darker. I also pick up a sort of lime-ish citrusy scent that isn't in the description that I rather like, it brightens up affair a bit. Overall the scent is pretty subdued, and not something I felt needed to have a perfect pairing with as I didn't detect it any longer by the time I was ready to apply aftershave.\nI have a sizable sample here, so I'll be able to give it a few more goes to try different lathering techniques with. I'm happy with its performance as a whole as is, so there shouldn't be a whole lot of experimenting necessary, maybe just to tame the foamy stage a bit, i.e. a drier brush to load than I used. Nice and slick albeit a little thin, and a great post shave face feel, I can't complain! I look forward to using it, and Dark Limes soon! DFS and I'm feeling good!!! =)\n\nHappy Friday!",

The former having a great sweet, almost Christmasy scent to it and the later being a wonderfully dry and spicy version. This example from Australian Private Reserves marries those two and adds a bit of complexity. First you get the sweet notes but then they make room for the complex spicy and woody notes that linger with you throughout the shave and longer - and I didn't want them to leave. The for me perfect Paladin S-type knot never fails to amaze me and together with the soap they produced a creamy rich lather with ample slickness. Using the ATT S1 is just a joy - always a very relaxed shave with the end result being a super smooth and happy face.\n\n\n\n## I hope you have a fantastic weekend!",

At 5, the shave is smooth and efficient and it is adjustable!

I got my face pretty much cleaned up with no irritation but I found it very difficult to get the area below my jaw and my neck completely clean. My hair grows in weird ways in those areas and even with a safety razor I can only manage to remove *most* of the stubble. I'm gonna start practicing with the Feather properly, had it for a while and I've barely used it.\n\nHave a good one.",

Got this sample of LQV per recommendation from /u/huckleberryking -- another great one from /u/hawns. Will need to get a full bottle at some point.\n\nFinally settled on a travel brush. Got the 22mm C&R handle late last year from eichchops, and /u/drivenlegend set me up with the Maggards synthetic knot. Love it!!\n\nHappy Saturday everyone!",

If you really want to turn *Shag's* vetiver bombiness up to 11, pair it with *Marshlands.* This is awesome. My only regret is that I didn't splash on some of the Stirling *Vetiver* aloe & witch hazel that I have. Ah well, next time.\n\nNo lather hogging from the Ace today. Maybe it's already broken in. It definitely has a nice face feel: Soft, with just a li'l scrub. and enough backbone. It's on the lower end of 'enough' for me, though, since I do enjoy a bit more backbone in my brushes. It definitely has enough, but I think if it had less backbone I wouldn't enjoy it as much.\n\nEnjoy your Saturdays, all.",

I might have stated it previously, but L&L was the surprise soap of the year for me last year. I overloaded by almost double without realizing it. I had to keep adding water to get it where it needed to be and ended up with lather running all down my hand. Not a bad problem to have.\n\nI went to Maggard's with the intention of buying Bandwagon. I even asked that they hold a tub for me is the stock got low. I had it in my basket, but I kept going back to smell Trismegistus. I struggled with trying to decide. I kept switching the two in my basket for hours. (Yes, I was really at the store for several hours). Finally Trismegistus stayed in the basket. Good Saturday to all.",

I grabbed it right off the porch and went to the bathroom and shaved as soon as I got home from work. I'm curious to see others' thoughts on BBB. Maybe it was the temperature or something, but the scent was either really weak or my nose wasn't working but I just didn't pick up much of what I expected in it at all. Also, the aftershave was pretty heavily mentholated and I couldn't smell the AS beyond that. I won't say I'm disappointed yet because I know I need it give it a couple more chances, I'm sure it'll grow on me. Finally, Scoot makes the best soap so at least the shave was phenomenal :)",

One of my best shaves ever-- nearly BBS in two passes. Picked setting 4 because most agree that settings 3-4 are similar in feel to my other razor, a pre-war Tech. Great shave, no irritation.\n\nAlso, I'm half-heartedly trying to 3017 my Amici, which was my first shave soap. Love the scent, performance is okay (not as good for me as Pre de Provence, my current favorite).\n\nThe bath toys are my son's.",

I had a sample which I had only sniffed, but I knew I wanted to pick it up based on that alone. The scent is weirdly nostalgic for me, but I have trouble pinpointing where I've smelled it (and I feel like I HAVE smelled it before). I believe it had something to do with summer camp or being up north - like walking out onto the porch of a log cabin on a damp morning, but a little cozier than that. That's sort of what I get out of this scent. I think it's beautiful and evocative.\n\nWent with Unconditional Surrender as a pairing today - seems to work pretty well. I may have to pick up the matching splash for CeE at some point though.\n\nHope everybody has a good shave and a good day!",

That's what I'd say about the Bandwagon I jumped on this morning. At moments, it's reminiscent of Clubman, at others there's a greener scent that is right in the fougère wheelhouse of something like Brüt, but there's also other things subtly going on. A hint of spice here, an almost but never quite smokey whiff there. Powdery, but not vanilla-sweet underneath it all. Based on looking up the scent profile after the shave, the only specific ones I picked up and recognized were the anise (only a small kiss in the scent) and bergamot. I thought there was some oakmoss and that may be the powdery elements. All in all it smells really good. You can smell it, and know it fits in the barbershop area, but it's not quite like any others, it stands in it's own space.\n\n\n\nHave a good one!",

Normal shower with an artisanal bath soap prep. It was definitely a little bit of a challenge with this razor. The face was fairly normal other than a kind of diagonal XTG on my upper lip. I instinctively tried to do a normal WTG there and, yeah, that head doesn't fit there. My neck was a little challenging. The angles were a little different from my usual DE, so that was an adjustment. One weeper on my upper lip, but none other than that. I did wind up with some irritation, but nothing major. I'm giving this shave a C+. Acceptable finish but a little rough. Oh, and I realized too late that I had forgotten to order blades online, so Rite Aid was my only option. I'll keep at it. I will say it was nice to be a little challenged by a shave again.",

Canada 1932)\n* Post: Chatillon Lux Yuzu Rose Patchouli AS\n\nWaited til the mail came so I could try one of the six soaps that come in the sampler from Wholly Kaw! After sniffing out the winner, I dug out some aftershaves to make a good pairing. Something about the freshness of the dark vetiver really drew me to the delicate/light scent of the Y/R/P. (Although, it was a tough choice between the YRP and Unconditional Surrender) The performance of the tallow base from WK is top notch! I was very impressed with the lather/scent, and the face feel after the shave was fantastic. I'm sure some people would skip the after shave because you don't \"need\" it with the post this soap provides, but I'm too much a stickler for the full experience.\n\nHappy shaves to all.. Have a safe/happy easter weekend!",

I also decided to give the Meissner a different lathering approach. Today I started with a damp brush, I soaked it for a second then squeezed all the water out, and began loading. Adding water slowly, it started out thick and creamy, and eventually turned foamy again, so I continued working it until it thinned out again. I didn't load enough for all three passes, rather than get a bad third pass, I just omitted it from today's program. Everything was great aside from not loading enough. Love this razor!!!\n\nHave a great weekend everyone!",

Such a drastic contrast to the SR shaves! I set it to 1 at first to start but it didn't even seem like it was cutting any hairs so I moved it to 3. Holy crap this Slim is amazing. I shaved my whole face at the 3 setting and at no point did it seem like I was in danger of cutting myself, even when I went against the grain all willy nilly. I'm pretty sure that this was the closest shave I've gotten since I began doing this wetshaving business. Why doesn't everyone use this razor?? And to think I got it for $13 shipped!\n\nLather exploded again today. I feel like maybe I've actually been using too much water and overloading the brush too since there's probably enough lather left over after 3 passes for another pass. Then again... it's not like I shave everyday and soap is cheap, so whatevers. I don't really like cleaning up the lathery mess though so I'll probably use less water next time.",

I figure this would be an opportune time to break out the [new addition to my den.](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0Bx62Nre2N1zdUHJ0U3U2U1VhQnM?usp=sharing) Now, I really wanted to like this razor (since it is made about 20 minutes from my home) but, I, errr, uh... I LOVE IT! I got the angle straight away and proceeded to do a 2-pass shave and I didn't need any more. I would put this razor toward the end of an ATT H2 but slightly less angry. Now, I did get the 0.95 gap with scalloped head, so it smooths it out a bit compared to my H2 (open comb). The finish on this razor is phantasmagorical. A big thank you goes out to the State of Ohio for a return of some of my income tax.\nAnd a shoutout to /u/Nusquam-Humanitus (the USPS delivered the Priority Mail yesterday!) and also to /u/Huckleberryking (I helped out the local economy!)\n\nThe shave itself was terrific with my second tub I picked up recently from *Cold River Soap Works*. The *Citrus* is more a tart citrus rather than a sweet or candy citrus. I really enjoy it. Top quality lather all around.\n\nHappy Easter everyone and great Sunday shaves to all!",

I mean, first lathers are not always the best lathers. But being the cheap bastard that I am, I didn't want to waste any soap doing a test lather. So, I just dove right in. It went very well, but I underloaded and had to hit the puck again. I'm always happy when I try a new soap and it turns out to really work for me. I think I'll like this stuff. A shit load of yard work awaits. I'm not sure I am motivated enough to do it.",

While it doesn't smell like a doughy dessert, the blackberry and spices are certainly reminiscent of it. Intstead though, they are engulfing undertones of rum and camphorous bay. So, the scent is wonderful, and really blooms nice and bright in the toner. The downside is, my skin seems to not like something in the fragrance. The soap wasn't unbearable, but the toner really set my face on fire. But damn the smells are sooo good. I'll have to think on it, and see how it reacts on my face over the course of the morning.\n\n\n\nHave a good one!",

This was my kiddo's first Easter so obligatory **[pic](http://imgur.com/a/j7Mn5)**.\n**Lather:** SdM\n**Brush:** Tortie Hucklaration\n**Razor:** Wolfman WR1 on ATT Kronos handle\n**Blade:** Polsilver (1)\n**Post:** Project Mayham (CL Vide Poche, B&M Reserve Spice, Lucky Tiger Tonic)\n\nBloomed up SdM, then loaded up the Huckie for 45 secs. Yes, a whole 45. There was enough lather for 4 passes, and I took advantage of all of it. WTG, 2 XTG, ATG + spot cleaning. It was a wonderfully luxurious shave.\n\nStill trying to figure out the right blade + handle for WR1. Polsilver was definitely better than the Astra I used. No nicks this time, though irritation was a different story. But that is a different story. I'm getting a Ti handle this week so looking forward to using Wr1 with that.\n\nNow on to the burn. I was working all day in the killing weeds / fertilizing plants / etc and now I believe shaving right after a sunburn is a terrible idea. Skin was red after the shave and this is how the AS application went:\n\n1. CL Vide Poche: Huh, haven't used that one is a while. How does it smell again? OUCH! OUCH! OUCH! My face is on firrrrrrrrrrrrrrrre!\n\n2. B&M Spice: This elixir will fix everything. Oh, this is good! But I need to splash my face with something cool!\n\n3. Lucky Tiger Tonic: My old friend! I feel like a seal in Arctic now!",

It opens up with a huge kick of bay and spices and then settles down into more of a spiced blackberry scent. Took a bit to get used to, but an enjoyable scent. This is my first L&L soap and it does not disappoint.\n\nLike /u/jdubba said, the aftershave has a distinct burning sensation (the cinnamon?) but the menthol in the aftershave toned it down after the first few seconds. I think my next pairing is going to be Passiflora + BBB. That should be fun.",

Used boar over my usual plisson, and attempted to face lather with some success. I can't seem to get the real hang of face lathering. I see everyone swirling their brushes around their faces in videos with clouds of lather, and all I end up doing is pushing the lather around my face while I get it all over my hand. I'm going to keep trying, but it's getting frustrating. Not a super fan of the boar brush 's scratchiness, I feel very exfoliated which I know means my skin won't be happy tomorrow. Thank goodness for Chiseled Face because my face feels very moisturized and the scent makes me happy.\n\nI think I'm done with my parker. It's time to move on to a better razor, whatever that may be.\n\nPleasantly surprised by the Eau Sauvage. Was a great fresh smoky green when I first put it on, then dried down to some great oud. Has somehow turned into a pleasant vanilla, but more like vanilla beans, not creamy vanilla.",

I have a sample of Santal Austere and he made me a full bottle of the Rose Verte awhile back as a custom. Which by is arguably one of the nicest roses I have ever smelled. I think this is easily going to be his most elegant scent to date. I don't usually by multiples of anything but I think I will for this one. Was going to bring out AoS Sandalwood or MdC Rose today but I needed some Wholly Kaw this morning. After trying some different blades in the Wolf and still getting good shaves the past two days made me realize nothing comes as close as a Rapira. So incredibly smooth.\n\nOn another note, I think I'm done cooking holiday dinners for a long time. Just too much work and I don't get to enjoy the food as much or the time with family. Next big holiday it's pizza. I'll still make the desserts though.\n",

It worked really well today! Very smooth and slightly more aggressive than the 34C. So far a good buy! Normally on a trip like this I'd bring a throwaway cart but I decided to check in luggage which also allowed me to bring some decent soaps. T&S Rainforest is so damn good.

But that worked out without any irritation.\n\nI got SoA to create a good lather for me today--honestly I'm pretty sure I prefer glissant.

What a fantastic scent. After everything I've been told about this product I expected a really nice experience and I had one. It lathers easily and quickly. Really Good performance. I can't help but compare it to Cade Rich since that is the only other cream I have extensive experience with. Calder Rich take the win on the post shave feel. But Speick wins the scent hands down. Performance, surprisingly, is pretty close. I'll have to have more experience with Speick to get a better measure of it.\n\nStarting another week with this well used blade.

On the blade itself it says \"Made in Germany\". Yoinks! The last time I used a German-made blade was years ago and it was a Merkur. It was not good. This VDH blade was adequate, but not very comfortable. It had a lot of blade feel to it when I was shaving. I won't use it again. It wasn't as bad as a Seagull, not many blades are, but it's certainly not good enough to keep around for a second shave.",

The white label is still performing great even though it's almost gone. The scent of the puck is greatly diminished, but once lathered up it is only slightly weaker than it ever was. First shave with the Slim in a very long time, I typically prefer a much lighter razor. Awesome shave let's hope it's an awesome week!",

The previous owner must have put a damn good edge on it as it is as sharp as they come, and having such a long, smiling blade is really nice. Good way to kick off the week!\n",

I'm not good at critiquing scents so I'll just suffice it to say that it smells wonderful and the performance was terrific, my face felt great afterwards. Well done /u/landlgrooming and /u/hawns!\n\n\nThis was also my first shave with the ATT S2, which I got a great deal on from /u/Nusquam-Humanitus. The razor is, of course, beautiful and well made. Even though I knew the name was Colossus I was surprised by the length and heft. Both the longest and heaviest razor I've used.\n\n\nI thought I was having difficulty loading and aligning my blade because the exposure seemed to taper off, but on closer inspection this seemed to be by design due to the slanted head. The blade was aligned and the tapering was happening on both sides in the blade.\n\n\nI then thought I was having difficulty finding the cutting angle because I was often not getting any audible feedback. However it turned out the razor was cutting very efficiently and I got quite possibly the closest three pass shave I've had since I started wetshaving. And as it turned out I really like the handle length.\n\nI still need more experience with the S2 but so far it seems it will suit me very well!",

The soap performs well and exhibits a likable woody character. The slickness and cushion were both great. I find the post shave to be good while the residual slickness leaves me wanting. The good news is that the lather can be run thin and still provide plenty of protection. Don't even need much.\n\nThe alcohol splash is wonderful, kept my skin happy all day through a sweaty hike without any greasy feeling. This set is on loan from /u/La_Yerba_Mate and I've used it a few times now. Today I added some black powder because it sounded like a good mix and I wanted a dash of menthol. It went splendidly.\n\nPleasant shaves.",

I quite enjoyed the scent! If Puzzle taught me anything, the Neroli is prominent in BBB. I'm not sure if I forgot what blackberries smell like, but I didn't get a whole lot of berry scent.

I've been using the same Astra Platinum blade for like 6+ shaves now and even though the Gillette Slim shave two days ago was excellent maybe it's time to swap blades. I tried to use a bit less water to load the brush but failed spectacularly again. Lather everywhere. I usually load a bit longer than 30s but couldn't this time because the lather was flying everywhere, and sure enough I had more than enough lather for 3 passes. The RazoRock felt a bit more foam-y and less slippery compared to the Stirling soaps I've been using, but that's probably because it's my first time actually doing a real lather with it and I put too much water during the loading phase.\n\nI skipped the alum for the first time ever and went straight to the aftershave. It was alright, but I don't think my skin particularly cares for the alcohol. After a few minutes it felt a little dry so I put on the Nivea, and eventually the Aveeno. Maybe this is a sign that I should order some Chatellion Lux salves or Dapper Dragon scale polish to try...",

Back up in Northern Minnesota for some work. I got a notification that my BBB order arrived back home, but I won't be back to use it until early May. In a show of solidarity, I decided to use the Bay Rum I brought with me. Captain's Choice seems to perform pretty darn well for me. Slickness is adequate - not as good as B&M or CF for me, but the post-shave feel is quite good. The scent has also grown on me some. It's clean and very Bay forward, but I don't think it's one I'd want a full tub of. I think eventually I'll pick up a Captain's Choice sampler to try out their other scents - North seems particularly interesting to me.\n\nBarrister's Reserve feels real nice on my face. The scent is great but not too long-lasting. I'm alright with that, as it makes fragrances a bit easier.\n\nLast year when I was up here, I visited Duluth. Part of my time there was spent at the Vikre Distillery, where I got to try some of the gins and other spirits they produce. I remembered that, and decided to stop at the first liquor store I saw that I figured would carry their stuff. Picked up this gin and another one, and my pic up some more on the way home. Anybody who is at all into craft spirits and finds themselves in northern Minnesota should check out Vikre.\n\nHope everybody's had a good day and good shave.",

I filled up an ice bucket and used ice cold water in the prep and throughout my shave, and it felt wonderful!! So refreshing. CRWS was slick as can be, and my new travel razor had another good performance. Great shave today, although I miss the post shave feel of my T&S soap.\n\nHave a good day everyone!\n\nSong of the Day: [Fugazi \"Waiting Room\"] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGJFWirQ3ks)",

I am a big fan of Bay Rum types scents and this one doesn't disappoint. There's a beautiful floral dimension that really comes through. The L&L base is amazing. I haven't used L&L too much so it took me a second to figure how to work with something so soft. The slickness and post shave feel were awesome. I was on the fence about buying this one (only because I have too much soap) but I'm thrilled that I did.\nhttp://i.imgur.com/kYznadr.jpg",

I don't know what's gone on between me and this soap, but my first 2 shaves and 2 additional AS tests on my hand left me thinking this was severely under scented. I had to think that either I'm broken/have gone crazy or that I got the only bad set in existence. I equate it to a color blind person simply unable to see a certain color, there was almost a block between my nose and brain that was unable to pick up anything. Congrats and thanks to /u/hawns for another great scent. Glad that all is right with the world again ;)",

Yesterday I did a two pass shave and got near BBS. Needless to say, I was highly impressed with the vintage razor and it's performance.\n\nTo see if it was a fluke, I decided to keep everything the same. I'm happy to report that I obtained an even *closer* shave on day 2. While I gave up chasing BBS, I am *very* damn close to it using this razor. Not only does the razor give a smooth, close shave, it also is comfortable. I have constant irritation on my neckline (always have because apparently I'm a mutant) but it seems to have lessen since I started using this razor. Of course, I'm only 2 shaves in but it doesn't seem to be as 'angry' as usual.\n\nKeep up this performance, Slim, and the Rockwell is going to find itself on the bizarre.",

Its a rich and warm vanilla tobacco scent, but not too sweet and heavy to enjoy even on warmer days. It should give me a chance to cycle through some tobacco fragrances like the Dreamer, which is just fantastic.\n\n\n\nHave a good one!",

Luckily, I had the Classic and so today was a good shave day\n\nI bought the Cooper&French soaps when they were having a sample sale and I really like the scent of the Barbershop. When I received my first sample from them, my lather-game was terrible. Over the past few months as I've improved my game, I wanted to give this soap a try...mostly because I really love the scent from it.\n\nI like that the Scent is great, you can smell it as you shave but it's not overwhelming. Soap lathers really well - i face-lather and had no trouble working up a really good lather very quickly and quite slick during the shave. Post-shave feel is where I felt this soap lacked a bit - not quite as good as a B&M soap, perhaps on par with Stirling. Overall though, I really liked this soap and look forward to going through all of their samples that I have.\n",

I skipped my usual Thayers first step and went directly to the *Cool*. Very nice and non-drying. Personally, the scent reminds me more of Aqua Velva than Floïd Blue, which is fine by me since Floïd Blue is a bit too powdery for my taste. Maybe a \"high class Aqua Velva\" would be my description.

The bay is usually too much for my nose and every Bay Rum scent I've tried doesn't even make it past the sniff test, besides now. While I still get some of the bay, its not too overpowering and the sweetness from the blackberries help mellow it out. Overall, I would say this scent is a winner and I'm glad I took a chance on it.\n\n\n\nAlumigoose wasn't too nice to me today :( first pass was great. 2nd pass was rough, not sure what happened but got some weepers on by my adams apple. Oh well, tomorrow I may skip my neck to get it some time to heal up.",

The US one has always struck me as the smoother of the two, but I've never tried them side-by-side to actually compare.\n\nToday, I noticed something I had never noticed before. The despined blades I'm using are slightly narrower than the originals. What this means is if I install the spine butted against the back edge, there will be less blade exposure with the adjuster on max (which is where I set it at)\n\nThe more aggressive Canadian model felt like its pussycat US cousin today with the blade spine butted against the back edge. When I moved the blade so that the cutting edge goes all the way to the stops, it was back to ER 1914-like aggression.\n\nI swapped the blade into the US razor, and when I butt the spine, it shaves like it always did - a pussycat. When I tease the blade forward for full exposure, it shaves just like the Canadian one.\n\nI love it when things make sense; if two razors are identical but shave differently, there must be a reason why. These two razors are essentially identical, so I'll send him the Canadian one, which has very little plate loss. The US one (my first AutoStrop) will never shine again - it's got patina that doesn't come off ... a true survivor that's gonna stay that way.",

I just really dislike bay rum and cinnamon scents and was super hesitant on even buying/trying this but I can say after lathering it up and letting it dry down that heavy cinnamon smell goes almost all away and blends in nicely with the vanilla and blossoms. Superb job on the scent!",

As i grow up, i realise that a lot of things are not within my control. My mum, probably due to a traffic accident a few years back from which she suffered some brain injury, is just so stubborn but she wasn't like that before. I try getting across to her e.g. introducing her to new stuffs but to no avail. Honestly, it can be so frustrating sometimes.\n\nWell shaving kinda provides me an escape, at least I can choose which soaps to use and which razor to shave with.\n\nEnough of the emotional stuff - Enjoy your shave and Enjoy your day people !",

Grew up shooting Smith Model 27-2s, but they're a bit bulky for CC. Hello J-Frame!

On top of that, it is my dominant hand, so today was a very interesting shave experience. Every water rinse etc. had to be delivered by my right hand - this caused a larger than usual flooding in my shave billabong :) At least I could use the razor with both hands (as I always do) - so the shave itself was actually quiet lovely. The Australian Private Reserve produced a [spectacular lather](http://i.imgur.com/sJ4RWcJ.jpg) - as expected and has a lovely floral scent - the BBS-1 paired with a Voskhod is such a smooth, yet supper efficient and close shaver and the end result was a silky smooth and very happy face!\n\n\n\n## I hope you have a wonderful Wednesday!",

This is a great soap for the warmer months. It is a blend of cucumber and bamboo. Went back to the Timeless this morning. I get a great shave with about any razor I own. The difference surfaces later in the day with beard growth when using an aggressive razor or less aggressive. Not that that is big news to anyone. I would say the Timeless has ZIP for blade chatter or movement. It is great for the ATG pass on my neck. Reminds me of the stiffness [Hey! phrasing](http://imgur.com/gallery/fFKaB) of the blade on my only SE, the GEM 1912.\nGreat Wednesday shaves to all.",

This is very runny, not like any cream I've used before. It smells somewhere between Mitchel's Wool Fat and random hand lotion, it isn't offensive at all, very mild in fact, but strange to me since I've been spoiled rotten by all of the fantastic artisan scents currently available. This stuff whipped up into a decent lather rather quickly, and is SLICK! I took a few days off due to an ingrown hair in a spot that I haven't ever gotten one, so I wanted it to heal up so I don't shave it off, which would suck heh. Anyhow, the shave was SMOOTH. I did my typical (with creams anyway) botching of the first lather. First pass was fine, second pass there wasn't enough lather, so I added more Mystery Cream. Once again I achieved a nice lather with a quickness, suitable for my second pass. I decided I should take it easy as not to re-set an ingrown hair in motion, so I'll be patient and wait for tomorrow to get back into the three pass mode.\nOverall I liked the Mystery Cream, it absolutely functions, even if it's form isn't what at I'm used to. I'm going to take a guess at what it is, is it Creamo???\n\nHave a great day folks!!! =)",

Want that consistent warmth!\n\nSo I spotted this barely used tub of Seville (white label formula) on the Bazaar recently which had me excited cause it had been a while since I've had a B&M soap in this old formula. I absolutely love the Glissant base but there is something different about the white label. The way it feels on the face throughout the shave. Just feels so nourishing. Then of course it's super slick and protective as well. Overall it was a great shave. Did only 2 passes cause I was running short on time but the Rockwell and the Polsilver blade still gave me a very close shave. Also, Reunion is great!\n\nHappy shaves everyone!",

I really like the performance of his soaps in general. His scent choices are always great (his most famous is probably Pipe Smoke which I also have). The Clean Cotton is very unique and pleasing. It is described as being that of fresh sheets being hung out to dry. I would agree with the description. While I was concerned that it may be too similar to laundry detergent initially, as the soap lather was built that concern was not brought forward at all. It really is just a clean scent that is not a soapy smell but that does have the subtlety of fresh laundry. My wife loved it.",

Unfortunately none of the scents particularly stand out to me, although since I started looking more into fougere scented colognes I'm kind of taking a liking to the MdC fougere.\n\nThe good news is I didn't cut myself at all with this shave, but the bad news is I didn't get that close of a shave on the chin area. I stropped my razor for the first time ever and I think I must've fucked it up. The shave didn't seem to come as easily as before stropping, so next time I'm going to take my time and do more passes. Also, I always seem to experience a bit of razor burn on the edges of my mouth. I think the solution there is to use less pressure when doing ATG. Martin de Candre didn't provide as great of a lather as Stirling for me, but I think I had too much water on the brush and failed to load sufficient soap since I stopped loading when the lather started spilling out. It probably has to do with the fact that my sample has less surface area than the Stirling puck samples also.\n\nI skipped the alum again and went straight for the Nivea. I couldn't tell if it had any effects.",

It was comfortable, but super mild. Took me four passes in some spots, and it still doesn't seem particularly close. I'll have to play with the angle a bit. Maybe try it with a new blade.\n\nOne more shave with this sample - It's a nice one. After this, I'll be messing with some of the floral/fruity spring scents from Stirling. I brought Pearberry, Plumeria, and Sunflower Fields with me. They smell nice unlathered - interested to see how I like them during the shave. I was thinking I'd be using them at the start of the warm weather, but of course it's been pretty chilly up here in Northern Minn. Oh well. I'll use what I want :P\n\nHope everybody has a good shave and good day.",

Mine is still slowly breaking in (faster than my 620 with comparable number of lathers) and it's an excellent little brush. I do wish the handle was slightly larger though.\n\nThe Rapira Platinum Lux razor is nothing short of amazing at a steep angle. I do wish it had a shorter handle for neck shaving but I'll look and see if I can find a light handle that I can use on it. If not, it'll be easy enough to whack off a few inches.\n\nThe IA frag is nothing short of amazing, just like /u/Eric--M said it was. I'm no expert at picking out scents but the vanilla is the star and what I believe to be the benzoin resin warms it up nicely. It matches up very well with Darkfall imo and I'll probably be pairing it from now on. Hanks for the suggestion Eric!\n\nHave a good one!",

I really have no idea I was getting such terrible shaves with them, maybe it's just I'm not used to them anymore. When things calm down a bit little bit maybe I can go back to exploring then, I'm not ready to give up on them yet.\n\nAnyway, overall good shave with the slim. I tried seeing if I could cut down one directional pass in my jugular area, no dice. I'm going to have to go back to a 5 pass in that area to keep things smooth and irritation free. I've also been exploring with buffing technique in my rough areas and it seems to help. It's worthwhile to experiment with.\n\nEnjoy your day, all!",

First go with Oceana and Im digging the scent on this one. Nice, crisp, clean scent and although Latha is pretty inexpensive, it packs a big punch performance wise.\n\n\n\nThe storm last night caused massive amounts of flooding nearby my house (including my basement). The intersection to get out of our neighborhood onto one of the main roads had about 2 feet of standing water when I pulled up. My fiancee said she didn't think her little civic was going to make it. Our basement wasn't too bad, maybe 2-3\" on the unfinished side of our basement. Still sucks since I wasn't expecting this to become an issue. The joys of owning a home :)\n\n\n\n**Have a great shave everyone!!**",

The UK razor, which comes as part of the Empire set, is nickel plated, while the Canadian razor was originally gold washed, but is now down to bare brass. Both razors have the traditional Gillette ball-end handle.\n\nVisually, the geometry is almost identical, and the feeler gauge confirms that both razors have a blade gap of 0.025\" (0.64mm). Both razors have reverse studs and corner fangs on the top cap for blade alignment, but the Canadian razor has diamond-shaped through holes in the cap. Of note is that the UK razor is a very rare pre-patent version.\n\nBoth razors are extremely smooth shavers, smoother than the NEW SC. Bottom line is that the two razors shave almost identically, and choosing one over the other based on performance is a toss-up. The Canadian Goodwill will stay (it looks cooler) and the UK Goodwill will go back into its original case.\n\nInsert obligatory \"Dapper Dragon ain't nothin' to mess with\"",

The Elvado is a vegan cream so I figured I was in for a different shave. Lathering was a breeze even with my hard water, but I must admit I was a bit concerned as while there was plenty of lather, it had a slightly airier, less dense feel than what I was used to (hard soaps with tallow). The good news is that my concern was misplaced. While certainly airy, the soap created a nice cushion, was slick, and overall performed very well. I still prefer the more dense lather from other soaps, but this no doubt has a place in the den and I will definitely be more open to vegan soaps in the future.\n\nThe Lush Kalamazoo is a product I don't see much on here, but that I've been happily using for a while now. Worth a try for sure.",

Didn't shave for a good while since I'm working from home for a while. Went the agressive route. So satisfying erasing the whiskers off so damn easily.\nI was hearing some folks getting a reaction from the scent oils. Luckily, I'm not one of them.\nHappy Shaving everyone!",

I spent some time \"dry stropping\" it after I first received it and I feel it made a big difference in the break-in time. It'll still take more wet/dry cycles to get it to that golden spot, but I'm already enjoying using it. The extra scritch is something I'm not used to with my badger, but I like the way it preps my face. I dug thru some of my sampler from tryablade.com and decided to try out one of the 7O'Clock blacks. Very nice, sharp shave. Chances are I won't invest in them since they are expensive and I find other blades work just as well for me.\n\nTrying to kill some of the many Stirling samples I have right now. I'm finishing up a cold, so my sense of smell is still a bit off. I should be receiving my Elysium from Storybook Soapworks tonight. I'm excited to try it.",

Thought the issue might have been the new blade, but I gave it a second try and was super careful about building the lather and maintaining the right angles. Nothing to complain about, BBS on the cheeks and only a bit of irritation on the neck.\n\nScent on Diamond *really* changed when I lathered it up, the sharp grass finally opened and I could identify the supporting popcorn and beer notes. When I was done, I put on the petrichor splash, which I (happily) find dirtier than the petrichor soap. Thought y'all were crazy before with identifying all the listed notes, but when I went back to smell the diamond puck I got a distinct and even fairly strong caramel smell. Incredible stuff /u/bostonphototourist",

For some reason, I haven't been able to get a good shave with a 1914. The possibility that my original one was \"off\" somehow came up so I snagged another in a lot. Comparing the two side by side, there are some differences, such as how the cap sits when the head is open and how tiny the blade stops are on the newer one (not sure if either matters to be honest. I'm almost positive the blade was sitting on the stops).\n\nI thought things were going well until I started to relather for the second pass and it felt like I poured gasoline on my head and lit it on fire. Even smearing soap with my hand was painful. Rinsing it off hurt. Alcohol based aftershave? Baaaaad idea.\n\nTrying to narrow down the culprit, I can't help but to think it was either a very bad blade or something about the '14. The soap doesn't cause my any irritation, I don't think you can get brush burn with a Declaration knot even if you tried and the lather was excellent. I'll wait a while and try the blade in a different razor and a different blade in the '14. Until then, those two things are staying far, far away from my head.",

Last time I used the Supermax on setting 6 and found that the blade caused a significant amount of irritation. This time I used setting 3 and still got little bits of irritation. Much better than last time but the irritation isn't gone.\n\nI don't know if it's me but it seems like Dapper Dragon is always foamy when I load it and start lathering, but if I do sideward swipes it settles down quite easily. However, the lather on the last pass was very thin. I shook most of the water out of the brush but maybe I'll just have to experiment. It performs very well though and I really like the post shave.\n\nHave a good one.",

This one is no exception. The knots he is putting together are the perfect face lather machines. This one just happens to be sitting in one of the sexy handles C & R turned out of Titanium. It's weighty compared to resin, but it's not super bulky the way stainless might be for a handle of this size. The handle shape and size makes it comfortable to hold and use even with the weight. The finish is lightly brushed so it's not a fingerprint magnet. This is my first metal handle, and it's a good one.\n\nEven though it's new brush day, I'm sticking with the Stirling. If I keep using these big dense Declaration knots, it might not last as long as I had originally thought. Paired it up today with the CK One Shock, which is a dirty, green, peppery tobacco-amber scent, and pretty good for the low price point.\n\n\n\nHave a good one!",

The CRSW Le Chypre Sombre performs unbelievably and smells outstanding. It's a bit nostalgic for me because it's similar to a scent my father used to use (in a very good way). The post shave on the CRSW is just freakin awesome, I can't speak highly of it enough.\n\nThis was my first shave with a Voshkod blade, I've been using Astra SP up until now. The first few strokes on the first pass had me thinking I forgot how to use my DE! Once the coating came off a bit it was all SUPER smooth sailing from there. Holy moly that blade is smooth. I find the audible feedback is reminiscent of a hard graphite pencil on rough paper, which I find quite pleasant and helpful. I'm looking forward to a second shave tomorrow on the Voshkod!",

The scent on this one though, didn't exactly impress me. It's a nice mild scent, nothing that will ruin your morning shave. However, it's not the \"After-the-rain\" smell I'm used to, coming from India as I am.\n\nI'm reaching a point where if I'm not happy within the first few moments of lathering, I'm pretty much going to give up on the soap. And that's how I felt with this. Maybe a 2nd shave to really confirm but I'm not so sure about that.",

Scent is really quite heavenly. Peppermint stood out as the primary note, but it's definitely rounded out to feel warm and decadent. Almost reminds me of a baked good (think macaroon). This soap is very soft so I took care when loading not to overdo it. Initial impressions are that it's also quite thirsty. Very slick feeling on this one once I reached the right hydration level and excellent post shave feel. I'll keep experimenting with this one, but I'm really glad I picked it up.",

It's fine, but usually a little thin. I definitely still get a better shave with TOBS cream. I will occasionally super-lather it with Kiss My Face, and that works a lot better.\n\nMore debugging is needed. I think next Maggard order I will explore Chiseled Face, MLS, and B&M to see if my issues are limited to Stirling, or shave soap in general. I might just suck at lathering soap.\n\nThe Merkur is fine, but I currently get a better shave with my EJ 89--both in terms of closeness and smoothness. I think that maybe the 37c is slightly more aggressive than my technique can handle well, so I'm being too conservative with it. I might try some Derby blades in it just so I can gain some confidence with it.\n\nBig improvement with technique: firm/locked wrist. Way better shave than trying to correct blade angle or flourish mid-stroke with wrist.",

I forgot how awesome the LASSCo charcoal/clay formula is. A few seconds of loading gets me way more lather than I know what to do with. The scent is nice. Very \"green\", slightly earthy. Plus, it's cool how the soap's appearance itself reminds me of dark mud and moss.\n\nEverything else, as usual, was awesome.",

I get a lot of Tea (probably just a light vetiver scent toying with my olfactory there) and Cedar from this, with Citrus on the back end. Not very similar to the L&L Tris.. Still a big fan of the scent, and the performance is out of this world, effortless lather and the cool tinge of menthol from the scale polish made for a great face-feel on a semi-warm day!\n\nHope everyone is dusting off the golf clubs and getting those beach bodies ready!

Really close shave, but I think I fucked my shit up pretty bad. I wasn't too sure how it went...I had felt some discomfort during the shave, but when I put on the CL and it burned more than it ever has for me, I knew it was pretty rough. Part of my problem seems to be that I'm having trouble making a good lather the past few days. Seems to be dissipating and drying out, so I clearly need to add more water. I should've stopped shaving when I realized that, but decided to push through. Moronic. I also will need work with the SE of course - what's a good angle to use these Pushbuttons at? I've read that some GEMs perform better with the topcap flat against your face, where others should have a bit more angle.\n\nThe scent on this Stirling soap is real nice. I get some sweet lemon backed up with a lot of floral and maybe a bit of oranginess.\n\nHope you all have a good day and a better shave than I!",

The splash is nice and cooling (without menthol?) due to the peppermint.

The first attempt with the Supply SE was poor and I had pretty much decided it wasn't for me. The shave this morning was the total opposite. Totally BBS with zero irritation. It just goes to show a little perseverance goes a long way.\n\nLGC is hands down my favourite soap. It invokes a mysterious nostalgia I can't quite put my finger on and when I use it I think about it all day. Sadly the ring of death has appeared but with the re-release this summer panic need not set in. A great shave all around.\n\nHave a good day people :)",

I think shorter, more purposeful strokes helped avoid razor irritation. It is much more aggressive than ATT described but still a great razor. May look into the milder head unless my shaves continue to improve.\n\nThe soap combination was hilarious and awesome. It was very comparable to a Halls Black cherry cough drop but not in a bad way. Both soaps, of course, performed beautifully. The black cherry was a very strong note with the medicinal menthol coming in underneath it.\n\nAs far Snake Bite. Holy hell. What an accurate name.\n\n5/7 will science soap together again!",

What a great shaving razor. Along with the 1914 I don't feel a need to use any other vintage SEs. But I still like my Dami and 1912s, just not near as much as the 1914 & 1914.\n\nI cannot remember the last time I used this soap. It was one of the earliest artisanal soaps I ever bought. What I remember about it is that it always performed very well for me and has a good post shave feel. It's a shame the soapmaker struggled with her business and lost a lot of customers. Maybe things will turn around for her.\n\nWell, if the rain holds off, I'll be shopping for shrubbery today. I hope to get about a half dozen bushes planted this weekend.",

Off the puck, I get yuzu (the scent notes just say citrus and it may be bergamot, but yuzu is the impression I get), musky tea and light patchouli underneath. It's not a far stretch from Y/R/P, but with the tea and musk it heads towards an earthier place rather than the floral arena of Y/R/P. Bringing them together though, is fantastic, and I capped it off with the deep rich rose from the Lyric Man. Same great tallow experience as always from Wholly Kaw, and it all made for an excellent shave.\n\n\n\nHave a good one!",

This blade is sheathed in a cover that looks similar to the box art on the Baili Super Platinum over at Try A Blade. However, the blade itself is completely unmarked and blank. And the blade cover is in English, not Chinese. Mine says \"Super Stainless Steel Blade\", whereas Try A Blade says it's platinum. Here's a picture of the blade cover: http://imgur.com/a/YkIeC\n\nI think my blade is a Baili, but I am not 100% sure it's platinum, since platinum is never mentioned on the cover. It shaved fine.",

It's a damn fine IPA and I'm glad to have had the chance to finally try some but Ruination is still the best IPA in my mind, so damn delicious.\n\nThis brush will be going back home to /u/MrTooNiceGuy soon. It's a shame because I've really enjoyed using it. The backbone is solid without eating soap. Plus them tips are heaven. I want one. :(\n\nPleasant shaves!",

I tried one of /u/Fahrenheit915's early samples, and while the lather was good, it was rather drying. This issue has been completely eliminated with his final product. The soap is soft and loads very easily. I loaded for maybe 10 seconds and had more than enough lather for a head/cheek/neck shave. Another user compared the consistency to L&L Grooming's, which I would agree with in terms of loading.\n\nOff the puck, the scent of Elysium is a sweet peppermint, with the sweetness likely coming from the vanilla. Once lathered, the peppermint subsides a bit and the lavender starts to show through. The lavender is much more noticeable in the aftershave than the soap. The sandalwood and cedar doesn't necessarily stand out individually, but I think they are doing some behind the scenes work to round everything else out.\n\nOverall, I am very impressed by SBSW's initial offering and am looking forward to seeing what comes next!\n",

Decided to try it out today. I smushed a bit into my bowl, and rubbed just a little bit of water on top because it seemed a bit harder. After my shower I loaded up my wet brush for about 10 seconds, and holy hell. I've never even heard of this soap, but it blew me away today. The lather was thick, silky, and left a residual slickness that felt like it coated and formed a fantastic barrier on my face even when rinsed off. Finished up with YRP and boom, maybe my favorite shave of all time. So sad that this is discontinued, grateful to have had a shave like this. Probably going to split it up and pass single samples out to some folks.. Happy shaves !",

I did the two pass thing I saw on YouTube and it wasn't very close of a shave. I definitely need ATG on the chin. I put less water on the brush this time and it lathered more like what I expect. I touched up the razors again on Norton stones and they can definitely treetop hairs now. I also cut up the strop a bit learning, but eh... live and learn!",

It wasn't just tugging on the first pass, I actually felt it pull some hairs a few times. Didn't get too close today, but also didn't exacerbate any irritation that was leftover.\n\nCold and rainy, so awesome opportunity to use Leviathan. Spanish Leather adds a touch of class to the less refined (but still fantastic smelling) Leviathan. The frag isn't too long lasting though, and Leviathan easily outlasts it with that lingering coffee leather.",

The shave quality of the artisan soaps compared to the classic soaps and creams I had stockpiled....well they don't compare - the artisan soaps were at least again a leap in quality in the difference I first had between a can of foam compared to soap and a brush. I have since given away a few soaps and creams of the classic genre to some friends starting out wet shaving and the rest I will keep around to shave my head with or further give away to people I know and try to talk into wet shaving.\n\nThe Gillette Goodwill was a maiden voyage as I just purchased it yesterday and spent the morning cleaning it up for this head shave. Another phenomenal vintage razor. I guess I shouldn't be surprised as I haven't tried a vintage razor yet that didn't out perform in my opinion a new current razor. I actually almost didn't buy it as I thought someone tried creating a Frankinrazor with the holes on the top plate and diamond posts sticking up. A quick search - I think it was \"Mr. Razor\" helped me see that it was legit.\n\nCan't wait to shave my face later this evening as I also picked up an Aristocrat Jr at the same time. It's like Christmas but better.\n\nShave on.",

Some of you may know that I'm a huge tennis fan. I've been playing ever since I could hold a racket, sometimes 5 or 6 times a week. Recently I got an idea for a brush collection where each brush would match the color scheme of a Grand Slam tournament. I figured since the French Open is the next Slam, it would be a great place to start! I'm incredibly pleased with the final product. The knot is absolutely killer too. Super soft, great backbone, basically everything I could have wanted.\n\nIt's also the largest brush I own now. Seriously, this thing [dwarfs](http://imgur.com/DJnOL0b) my other ones.",

This was the first time I've ever done a full pass with a straight. I used the Supply to knock down 3 days of growth and then 2 full passes with the Chimera. Ended up with a DFS with no blood and almost zero feedback from the alum. I'm finding it easier to find the angle with the Chimera over a traditional straight and will use it going forward.

All three had been forced open at some point and had been improperly closed up with not enough spring pressure. If your Injector \"rattles\" with no blade, it's been opened. This could have no effect on the shave, or a lot depending on how loose the blade is and if the head was warped when trying to force everything together again.\n\nSince I take apart every Injector I buy to tighten the spring, I volunteered to fix them. It's a frustrating repair the first few times you do it, but dirt simple once you get the touch.\n\nThe two E3s took less than five minutes combined, and the E2 took about 15 minutes because both the guard and top cap were bowed. Complete success on all three.\n\nNow the shave test. Both E3s shave identically to my Canadian E3. This was my \"payment\" for the job; I got to try a US-made E3. Too bad I was so obsessed with getting a hard to find Canadian one, I'm talking to you Mr. /u/Old_Hiker. The American E3 shaves identically.\n\nThe repaired E2 shaves nothing like any of my E2s. It's got more blade feel and is way more efficient. It almost feels like the Type F (which I prefer). It's all laser straight, so it's not due to a defect. It's got a narrower head, and the geometry between the blade stops and guard is different. I really like the way it shaves.",

The load and lather were easy. The shave was one of the easiest I have had. Three passes resulting in BBS. The slickness on this stuff is great, that is what made the shave so easy. I really like the scent as well. I don't have anything in my den that is similar. I just grabbed the CL Delor de Treget, but am curious what other people are pairing with Elysium.

The sunlight gently filtering through the canopy above, painting an ethereal light across his way. When he would come across a dense thicket, he would get on his hands and knees, and worm his way through the underbrush, scraping bark and mashing the lavender plants into his trousers along his spindly legs. After a time, he came to a little house in a clearing amongst the groves, where a kindly old woman was tending her rose bushes. Spying the boy come meandering out of a little path near her house, she called him over. After introductions were made, she invited the boy into her sitting room where she serverd some light afternoon tea, and soft vanilla candies to refresh him, before his journey back home.\n\n\n\nThe End\n\n\n\nThat's what I smell like today. It is awesome. Have a good one.",

What a great razor. The first pass was pretty tuggy, but I think that's because I was still figuring out the angle it worked best at. Never before have I felt so comfortable shaving ATG. That's where the real difference was with this razor. Probably the best $6 I've spent wetshaving yet. Obviously I'll need to get a few more shaves under my belt with this thing, but I can totally see this becoming my daily go-to. Fantastic.\n\nAlso my first time trying Rhapsody! I splashed a bit on myself a couple days ago, no shaving involved, and was surprised by the spiciness I got from it. Thus, I thought it might pair well with this Bay Rum. I was right! I agree with others who have noted that Rhapsody is a pretty complex scent. I'll have to try it some more, but I don't think I'm in love with it.\n\nHope everybody has a good day and good shave!",

No cuts this time AND a much closer shave in the chin area. I think I'm getting a hang of this \"no pressure\" business. No pressure means no irritation and no irritation means I can go over problematic areas again without worry. I guess staying up super late to hone the shit out of two SRs until they can kinda pass HHT was worth it since now I'm able to place more faith in the blade being able to do the job with light pressure.\n\nLast time using MdC original didn't really impress me and this time I used the 24mm Stirling instead of the 21mm Muhle and loaded for a 30-count, despite the overflowing lather. I thought I squeezed out most of the water, but considering the lather amount... maybe not? The soap felt pretty slick this time around and was good for 2.5 passes. It probably could've done another whole pass easily. The scent is still whatevers to me though.\n\nI kinda nicked the strop a bit learning how to strop, but I guess that's just a part of life. None of the nicks are too bad. Maybe in a few more shaves I'll feel confident enough to strop my professionally honed razor. Do people strop with canvas/linen/cotton side every shave before using the leather to strop? In other news the missing screw from my secondhand strop was kindly replaced by the awesome folk at Straight Razor Designs free of charge. Shoutout to Don at SRD!\n\nI hope ya'll have a fantastic shave today.",

      "body": "[04/24/2017 SOTD](http://imgur.com/64ysTOL)\n\nHello, people of r/wetshaving !\n\nI've been a lurker (and occasional commenter) for a pretty long while now and this is my first SOTD post. I wanted to make it somewhat special and decided, as I still had the gear around, to re-do the very first DE shave of my life. For science, for fun and for your enjoyment I took the risk of a sub-par shave. So behold the line-up of my plunge into wet-shaving, about 4 years ago :\n\n* Prep : warm water splashes\n\n* Razor : Merkur 25c (long handled open comb)\n\n* Blade : Merkur(1)\n\n* Brush : none\n\n* Soap : Nuxe men « dream shave gel »\n\n* Post : Alum\n\n* Aftershave : Klorane « cible » after-shave balm\n\nRemembering my first shaves with this equipment, I wonder how I sticked to it as the number of nicks & cuts and the degree of irritation could be considered off putting for many. So I approached my sink this morning with fear and apprehension. Thanks to this, it's been a very slow and thoughtfull shave, and it did go much better than expected !\nThe \"soap\" is much better than in my memory. It's a brushless gel that forms a decently slick (though thin and lacking any form of density) layer of lather on your face with a minimal time of hand rubbing and a few drops of water. It has close to no smell except the stink that is produced by the gas in the can. The razor, though not my favorite now, is very decent and easily manoeuvered. These blades are often badly commented about. I would not use them myself if not for circumstances such as today's. It's indeed not great at all but still cut through stubble and gets the job done. The balm doesn't smell much but it at least not unpleasant and actually soothes the skin, feels fresh and moisturizes.\nFinally, I archieved a pretty close DFS in 3 passes and litlle touch up, which is pretty nice considering the products used. This was not nearly as enjoyable, quick, close, pleasantly scented or comfortable as the shaves I am used to now but was not the bloody disaster I expected. Thoughtfull shaving and a few years of technique improvement made a world of difference !\nApologies for the long post, kudos to those of you who read all of it and a great shave to all !\n\n",

I've been doing one plant/tree/flower bed installation per year, and today's should finish off the front and sides of the house. I'm pumped to get it underway.\n\nThe Monaco Royale is simply an A++ in my book. I followed it with the Pitralon German which is not an ideal pairing, but it will have to do for now. I'm still looking for a top notch Fougere-ish toner to better pair with this soap *and* the highly anticipated WK Ass Milk Fougere Bouquet soap arriving at the end of the month. The Bois du Portugal EdC is in my top 3 warm weather colognes. It's got fantastic woody, green, vetiver and floral notes that remind me of spring all day long.\n\nEnjoy your Monday, gentlemen!\n\nEdited formatting",

I think 15 seconds total would have been sufficient. Face freezing was a success! But I didn't get enough of those smells. I'll try adjusting the ratio next time. 1⁄3 Cryogen to 2⁄3 other soap.\n",

Anyhow, great quality lather with LASSCo soap. Excellent shave with the V3A. No irritation to speak of. Great Monday shaves to all.",

The slickness and protection is just downright outstanding. I never once felt anything but EXTREMELY comfortable throughout the entire shave. I'm not going to do it justice, but the scent is fantastic. There is a burst of fresh mintiness as you open the tub. It reminds of a hot cup of mint tea almost. There is an earthy quality that gives the scent some body and fills out the the scent after you get the top notes which I assume is the vanilla. The only thing I'm upset about is not getting any aftershave, doh! I knew I should have added it on. /facepalm",

That's what the labels tell me anyway. To my nose the soap and splash don't smell alike, but that might be the result of my nose being dulled by too much tobacco smoke.\n\nI've been leaning pretty hard on my synthetics lately. Despite not wanting to chew up too much of the wonderful (and dear) Eufros, I put my beautiful ebonite Paladin to work. The Paladin can be a bit of a hog sometimes, but Eufros and Bufflehead are the two soaps I own where I couldn't fuck up the lather even if I tried. This shave no different. Good stuff, Eufros.\n\nI can't believe it, but I'm down to my last 5 Astra SPs. A big 100 count box was one of my first wet shaving purchases. I bought 85 Voskhods off someone in the S_B and only have about 10 of those left too. Time to order some samples to see where to go next...",

What an amazing experience. I didn't expect much. Given the age of the soap it had lost much of its scent (if not all). But the lather it produced was just awesome! Thick, rich, creamy, Cade-like lather. Combined with the super soft gel tipped Declaration and ultra efficient Cobra, it was incredible. What a great way to start the week!\n\nHave a great day everyone!\n\nSong of the Day: [Jeff Buckley \"Hallelujah\"] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8AWFf7EAc4)",

Used it on my head and thought it was a good shave - tried it on my face today and know it is a good shaver.\n\nI'd like to thank Simms of Canada for being difficult for me to date my brush (caveat is I am not so good on the internet). Also would like to thank Gillette for having a plant in Canada long ago to produce such excellent razors, and finally I would like to thank Canadian artisan Ryan at Tallow and Steel for yet another excellent lather.\n\nEnjoy the day.",

Yesterday's shave, while quite comfortable, was also quite inefficient. Today, I held the razor at a much different angle, leading to a much more efficient shave. There was a slight sacrifice in comfort, but not much, and this is the closest to actual BBS I've ever gotten my face. I think the razor is a definite winner, and I'm going to have to do some serious blade exploration.\n\nHope everybody has a good day and a good shave!",

This was honestly my favorite shave in a while. The L&L Original has a very pleasant, clean scent that is sure to become a personal favorite. The only issue with today's shave was a brand spanking new Personna Lab Blue (first experience with this blade) that irritated my face a little. The L&L Original splash quickly remedied this, however, and my face was left feeling soft and nourished. I often feel like a /u/landlgrooming fan boy, but what can I say? Scoot makes some awesome shit. I look forward to hearing others' thoughts on the Original.",

Anyway, I don't know how many have picked up the new Select (Premium) line from CRSW but it's really good stuff. The soap is slick and cushiony. I think it lacks a little in the post shave that leaves behind a slight oily feel.\n\nThe scent of American Barbershop to me is very close to WSP Barbershop as well as Reef Point Soaps Classic Barbershop. It's probably the same pre-blend as WSP but CRSW doesn't use as much. It's on the muskier side that most other barbershops with very little powder, citrus, and florals going on.",

Shave went perfectly, chiseled face never disappoints, and the supply razor is idiot proof and extremely comfortable.\n\nHave a great day everyone",

This is round one of a two part interview. I spent the whole weekend putting together a 30-60-90 Day Action plan so hopefully that sets me apart a bit.\n\nWent with this MLS offering because I imagine the soap/cologne qualities it has will be the among the most universally acceptable scents I have. I considered going with Fine Platinum but my interview is early this morning and I've found that Platinum can sometimes be a bit powerful for the first few hours of the day and figured this would be more tame.\n\n*Fingers crossed*",

Not a grainy texture, like ground wheat sort of smell. It's an interesting under note. Once lather though, that goes away and the sandalwood really opens up. It's not a super complex scent, but it is very clean and elegant. I did get some mild tingle from this one, so there may be something in the fragrance oils my skin doesn't like, or it could be just my skin being picky today, it does that sometimes. I'll need to use it again to see if it repeats. I decided to pair this one up with the CL DdT. I briefly considered Fourth and Pine for the heavy citrus, but decided the cedarwood from the DdT would be a good compliment, and it was. Topped it all off with the Eau Sauvage Parfum, to give it that amber and patchouli earthiness, and I'm good to go for the day.\n\n\n\nHave a good one!",

I've been away on business for several weeks, and during that time... it's almost too painful to say... I resorted to using cartridge blades and canned goo. I'm moving soon, so I'm tightening the belt, and couldn't justify buying another setup to use while on the road. I hated everything about it while I was doing it, and I am ashamed.\n\nHowever, last night, last glorious night, I finally returned home. When I arrived I had a barely used tub of The Kraken waiting for me (which I picked up over at /r/Shave_Bazaar), as well as several samples that a few folks were kind enough to send to me. This would be my first time using an artisan soap in a full container, and my god it was good. My lather was a little thinner than I expected, likely due to not loading the brush for long enough, but the shave was still superb. After having tried both Maggard's take on it and now MLS, I am definitely a barbershop fan. I still need to refine my technique, as the Feather Hi-Stainless will easily emphasize - not quite as close a shave on my neck as I would prefer, and just a few nicks here and there. Even considering this, it was an excellent shave, and it felt great to get back to some decent gear.",

Soap performance was on par with other artisans. The soap is extremely easy to lather and is very thirsty. Cushion is very good. I have slicker soaps in my collection and soaps that have better moisturizing/post shave feel, but this was a solid first release! Peppermint is forward with vanilla on the back end. I really liked the vanilla. It reminded me of the warm smoky vanilla present in IA's MoaT frag (minus the peppermint). Unfortunately, I experienced some skin sensitivity to something and so this is probably not a soap for me.\n\nHave a good day everyone!\n\nSong of the day: [The Rolling Stones \"Ruby Tuesday\"] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YJXfcndyvU)",

I sold my Leviathan tonique so now I don't really have anything to pair with it.. I was thinking about revisiting Bon Vivant since I was kinda \"meh\" about it, though I liked it the more I used it.. Then I realized that /u/hawns doesn't sell samples anymore. Is this temporary or a permanent thing?",

I really enjoy the scent of the Petrichor, it reminds me of quality time in the garden as a kid with my parents and grandparents. It smells exactly like wet dirt but there's a nice spicy background that peaks through every so often. Once the AS dries down that spicy scent becomes more pronounced, I can't place it but really enjoy it. Another full pass shave with the Chimera this morning. I love this razor, it is wicked sharp and easily maneuverable plus the western grind makes it easy to find the edge. One pass with the Supply and one with the Chimera and I ended up with a DFS. Have a great day folks!",

I love how it has a simple scent that's very soothing. Especially when all you want is a relaxing shave - a little quiet time in the morning. I'm also a huge fan of their Scale Polish because it feels so great on the skin!\n\nthe #4 on the rockwell was a nice surprise for me - used to be very aggressive for me when I first got the razor and so i only used it when i missed my regular shave day. past couple of shaves though, i felt that the #3 wasn't aggressive enough, so bumped it up and was surprised at how smooth it felt throughout. Will have to wait till the next shave to see how this plays out.",

First time doing back to back shave days. Kinda got the hang of the no pressure business but still suck at angles so I was rewarded with two small nicks on the chin area. Not that close of a shave on the chin this time, but it wasn't too bad otherwise. I lathered MdC to a 45 count using a mostly dry Muhle and it was way too much lather. Slickness felt good. Sometimes when my angle is iffy the blade skips over my face, not quite sure how to solve that. I resisted using alum despite the small nicks - still not sure if I miss it or not.",

I have to travel about five hours away tomorrow, so I'll probably toss the blade and give a different one a try in the V3A. Still a good and mostly comfortable, close shave.\n\nSunflower Fields was just the kind of scent I needed today after having worked in near or sub-freezing temperatures for the past week. It's bright with some good lemon and floral notes, without being too overbearingly sweet. It's not really a masculine scent, but I wouldn't call it a girly scent or anything. It's nice.\n\nHope everybody has had a good day and a good shave!",

Valobra is a classic and I can see why - [the lather itself](http://i.imgur.com/N2F6ZIu.jpg) was not bad and the slickness absolutely adeqaute. But the scent...well let's say we are much luckier today with our artisan soap makers ;)\n\n\n\n## I hope you all enjoy your shaves!",

I haven't used Baudelaire in awhile and actually was considering trading it. I'm happy I used it again, though, I forgot how awesome the scent was. When I first used it I think I described it as reminding me of going out on the town during a hot summer night in August, and that impression still really hits me. I'm ready for summer, no more of this rainy cold spring crap. Bring it on.",

I should probably use it for a week straight to get the hang of it a little more. I enjoy the length of the blade but am not crazy about the asymmetric blade. It forces me to use some add grips so I can use it correctly.\n\nThis soap almost went into the bazaar last night but it got a reprieve. I found something in the scent that I enjoyed last night.\n\nMy daughter bought me a new scent for my birthday last week. I wasn't a huge fan of the CK Eternity she bought me (I think she wanted the free promo bag ;-) so she and I took a trip to Sephora together. I really like this Atelier fig scent. Its going to work well in the summer. I am not sure it was a great match with the rest of the shave, but it's new and I wanted to use it. http://i.imgur.com/IECiJsm.jpg",

So obvs. I'm using woody lavender which has a heart of wood, and the Omega 10005 which has a handle of wood. I'm also shaving with a full-on erection, which, oftentimes, is referred to as \"a woody\" by the kids out on these streets* (*only if \"the kids\" are about 11 or 12, and \"these streets\" exist in some place in, like, 1992).\n\nOkay, the erection thing isn't true. Plus, I don't think shaving at full mast is even safe. It's not often that I drop my razor while shaving, but if that were to happen and I had my druthers, I'd much rather drop a razor on my flaccid dong, rather than bounce it off a chubby. Dunno, maybe I'm wrong about this, but it would seem to me that the dangly wang drop gives you a better chance at a glancing blow, whereas you got a real shot at a legit slice/dick injury if you drop a blade on your boner because you get that *boinggggggggg* catapult action. See, that's not what you want.\n\nIt's like they say, \"don't catch a falling knife.\" Similarly, don't slow down a falling razor by bouncing it off your erect pee pee.\n\nI once dropped my Wolfman and I'll be goddamned if the head didn't hit me solidly on the top of my abs. And that sliced me open nice and clean...twice actually; once on the initial blow and once a few inches lower on my stomach when it caught me a second time off the dribble. So I got relevant experience here.\n\nAnyway.\n\nGood semi-thematic shave today.",

For me, 5 doesn't give a noticeably better shave, but feels much harsher on the face, during and immediately after the shave.\n\nI have a tube of Proraso Red on the way. I like to cold-water lather, and the menthol in the Green makes that unpleasant (it's nice when I use warm water, and it's okay during the 70-degree NC spring, but not my favorite).\n\nLove this brush and aftershave. Cheap, easy, and good. I've been using the Nivea daily for probably 2 months, and am about a quarter-way through the bottle, too.",

So, I'm going to need to take it apart this weekend and give it some TLC.\n\nBecause of this regrettable setback, I threw my venerable Astra blade into my equally venerable Super Adjustable and went to town with some St. James of London this morning. Great shave. I'm smooth like polished wood, but smell like rough-hewn wood.\n\nTime to tackle this hump day the way it deserves.",

Rain. Dammit.\n\nWaking up today to yet another gray, rainy day had me in a 'I just want to stay in bed all day' mood. Chose Rhapsody for my software today because that scent always perks up my mood for sure. Also used the 34C for the first time in a while too. The 34C will always be a special razor for me because it's the razor I stuck with when I was refining my skills as a wetshaver. This is what I used from when I was a crappy wet shaver to a great wet shaver lol. I don't think it'll get used as much again as it was back then though. Back then I used to think I could only use mild razors. But once my technique improved and I got a couple new razors I came to learn that razors with a little more blade gap is what works great for me. While I don't grow a full beard what I do grow is coarse so I need something that lets the blade do its thing. Hence today my 3 daily drivers are a Rockwell 6S which I usually use on a 3, 4 or 5 plate; a Parker Variant and a Calypso R1.\n\nWhat was your 'trainer' razor?",

The scent is lavender, and very mild. I'm guessing some of this is due to its age, but I also think soaps didn't used to be as strongly scented as these days. It smells a little more of natural lavender than current bars of Yardley Lavender bar soap, which can smell more of soap base than (lesser quality) lavender.\nI started with a relatively dry brush, just a quick soak and shook out the rest of the water. I decided against my normal wet brush technique as not to damage the wooden bowl, it's unfinished, and not mine. It didn't take much to get the brush loaded and ready to go. I slowly added a few drops of water at a time, and this soap just kept taking it! It took a lot more water than I had originally thought. Rather than over-water it, I just added water until it was at a saturation point I felt was good, I don't think vintage soaps are like current soaps that just keep taking on more water.\nThe lather was a medium density and VERY slick. No problems whatsoever. The post shave is great too! Much better than I had anticipated, not too moisturizing, but zero dryness.\nI don't know if I would pay a collector price for this soap, but can definitely see how someone who has been using it for years would, both for nostalgia and quality of shave. I would absolutely use this soap again, but I might remove it from its wood bowl as not to ruin it.\nOverall a DFS! Thanks again /u/Eric--m!!! =)\n\nHappy hump day everyone!",

My girlfriend gets baby powder initially, something I don't pick up, but the smell evolves so much from puck to lather and throughout the shave. The big noted I pick up are an earthy leather and a dark musk. It's the way I imagine a swamp would smell, if swamp smelled manly and good. Aha. The aftershave lasted about 4 or so hours on my neck, and my head's still smell great.\n\nI was unsure about the Calypso initially but it just keeps getting better. I get BBS or DFS without trying now. It's efficient, comfortable although aggressive, and it looks hella good. I'd like to purchase the more mild head for this razor but evidently the heads aren't sold separately ):\n\nSoap Commander has also replaced Nivea for me. It's a great balm and a tiny bit goes a loooooooooong way. The most inefficient part of this shave was the amount of balm I accidentally wasted.\n\nAlso, I will forevermore advocate for textured shaving bowls. It has absolutely changed my lather and the quality of a shave I get. This particular one is from [Sarah Welch Pottery on Etsy](http://etsy.me/2oz2lHy).",

I also wanted to use this as an opportunity to learn proper angling for my chin area without bleeding for the information. I dialed the Slim up from 3 to 4 this time just to get a better feel of what changing the adjustment does. The difference is slight but it was there - the blade cut more readily despite the angle. As usual it was a pretty simple shave with no nicks. I actually went 3.5 passes but still missed a tiny spot on the left side of the chin. I loaded the soap to a 35 count with a gently squeeze-dried Muhle with a few drops on the MdC and it was pretty much perfect. On the 3.5th pass it was a bit thin, but I just needed to touch up anyhow. I began timing my shaves and it took me 28 mins from start to finish with the straight last time, yet only 18 mins this time around. That seems like a pretty long time in the bathroom...\n\nOtherwise I got some pretty bad news. I haven't received anything in the mail lately and have been stalking shave bazaar like a hawk, not even sure what I'm looking for. I have an itch to try out a badger brush and discovered the Hucklaration group buy. Holy moly that price point though.",

I'm starting to believe all the hype people have for this brand. Received some samples of Sterling and after a practice palm lather last night, I thought I'd try my face lather routine this morning. Didn't go as well, turned out thinner and I lost some globs of soap during the process. Had to reload for the final pass. I'll try a different soap tomorrow and just do a palm lather. Jury is still out whether I like the scent or not.",

I went to the Big Shave West in Pasadena, and I had to pick some up since it was a soap made specifically for the event, it was a nice Memento, I picked up a few other things as well.\n\nThe scent is not bad, and performance is pretty good. It's a cherry and rose scent with some other stuff, but I mainly get cherries, and roses. Smells like Cherry Coca-Cola out of the tub.\n\nI heard that Canadian Pre-War Tech is pretty aggressive. In mt opinion it was fairly mild, but much more efficient than other techs I have used in the past. I loved it in combination with the feather blade. I got a few weepers on my neck, but im sure the next shave will be better as I read that feathers can be rough on the first use.\n\nHave a great day guys! :)",

It looks to be triple-milled, can anyone confirm that it is? It's got a killer scent and has great performance. It also pairs very well with the B&M Classic. It was a great shave to start my day.

I find this soap/aftershave combo to be perfect in every way for summer: the scent is simple and straightforward while not losing any of that beautiful blending that makes B&M famous. The aftershave perfectly compliments the notes in the soap while adding a shot of menthol--something I don't always like but is perfect here. Such an incredible soap, I'm very happy I picked up two tubs and two aftershaves before it went away. If you can find some, grab it.",

Nice performance as well. Not a super lather but slick enough for a very nice shave.\n",

I don't know if it's the cream itself or the fresh Astra blade (or a little of both), but this was the smoothest shave I've had in some time. It takes only a small amount of cream (and more water than expected) to get a great lather.\n\nI really like the Elizabeth Street scent, but I have no idea how to describe it. From their website: \"With Top Notes Of Basil, Rosemary And Verbena. It Emerges Into A Spicy Fusion Of Juniper, Coriander, Cinnamon, Angelica And Finishes With An Oakmoss Accented With Fir, Patchouli And Vetiver.\"\n\nI'd like to try more of their scents because many seem quite interesting, but I'd forgotten how expensive they were. $50 for a cream + balm set is *steep*.",

I was lathering a little mindlessly today and managed to put too much water into SoA which turned it into a bit of a lather soup. Still had great slickness and smellz.\n\nI've been really enjoying tinkering with this Gillette Executive the last few days! It's my first adjustable and honestly I thought I'd be leaning towards the aggressive side of things but 5 really felt like a lot of blade feel. Down to 3 for the second pass and that was more my speed. I'm really looking forward to locking this thing in over the next few weeks.\n\nEnjoy!",

This was the largest thing I've attempted to finish off since starting wet shaving nearly a year ago. I'll credit heavy loading with the big dense Declaration knots for the last few shaves to getting through it.

So I went with a sample I had of LPV. I have been using the luxury offerings lately, and hadn't used on of the CB french style soaps in ages. In prepping the sample to load, it struck me that the texture of the soap was somewhat similar to MdC, which seemed logical. More moisturizing to use though. I haven't decided which CB to go with tonight.\n\nAlso for those pomade etc... users here, the combo of the O'douds and THB worked great. The O'douds is more manageable to apply, and I put that in first, which makes the application of the THB matte clay much easier. Usually I find that it tugs quite a bit.",

This means that I'm sitting on my balcony in the sunshine and fresh air, drinking coffee and being productive for a change. Days like today make me wonder why the hell I would ever need to go to an office in the first place.\n\nPré de Provence; what can you say about it? It's inexpensive, slick, residually slick, easy to lather, soft, gentle, post-shavey, pleasant smelling and overall lovely. So that, I suppose. All of that is what you can say about it.\n\nI think I need to try one of those Futur clones, because even set at 9, this Black Beauty really just feels like most any other razor with a moderate amount of blade feel. Or maybe my face is just getting leathery with age. Regardless, this was a nice, easy shave.\n\nIt's Thursday, and I'm beat. I don't know if I'll be able to keep up with this weekend, but I'm sure as hell going to try.",

It does creep up, too. It's about at the limit of what I like, right on par with Arctique and not quite as cold as Cryogen. It's a very soft soap, and loads very quickly. I used my normal wet brush technique to load, but in the future I will use a less wet brush.\nI do have soaps that are more slick, but this is plenty slick. I also have soaps that have more moisturizing properties, but this certainly didn't leave me disappointed. This soap really shines in the fact that it's SO COLD, and has ZERO menthol smell to muck up the awesome lavender blend it has going on. It's a nice blend that is balanced and refreshing, nothing too sharp or anything dark and heavy. A perfect match for the cooling effect it has.\nThe aftershave has a boozy smell out of the bottle, but that dissipated quickly. This isn't as cold as the soap, and once again, doesn't have the menthol smell messing up the lavender blend. The scent after applied is what I would describe as a nice clean lavender scent. Once again I think it's a perfect blend to compliment the cooling effect. This aftershave doesn't have any moisturizing properties, so fans of alcohol splashes will really dig this, if you like moisturizing properties, you may want to look to something unscented to supplement it.\nI'll admit I'm a bit of a sucker for packaging, and the ceramic bowl it comes in looks great! The purple dropshadow looks excellent, even better in person than in pictures. The aftershave looks awesome too, the purple bulb-like bottle with white print and white wax seal look awesome. They look great together, and will make a great display.\nOverall I'm stoked on having the set, and had a DFS with it today! This is going to be an awesome set for the hot summer days I know are coming this summer.\n\nHave a good'n everyone!!!",

The scent is great, but I feel like it's on the light side. I used CdL toner for the first time a couple days ago and today this splash and for both I feel the scent strength is light compared to other splashes I've used. We'll see how the longevity is throughout the day though. Overall, this stuff is great! :)",

Best artisan base that I've tried - others are good, but none have been this good for me yet. I may have to just buy alllll the L&L soaps. I'm still just in love with this scent. So nice.\n\nI had just a little bit of sting along my jawline from the aftershave, but a fantastic shave nonetheless. Still trying to figure out how to shave that area with zero irritation. Speaking of aftershave, Lavanille seems to be a decent pairing for this soap scent-wise.\n\nTime to start figuring out how I will spend my four days off in Duluth - I loved this city the last time I was here for work, so I'm excited to figure out what I want to do this time. I wish the weather was a touch warmer, but it's not tooo horrible.\n\nHope everybody has a good day and good shave!",

The menthol is pleasant, but I'm really waiting for my stirling glacial shipment to arrive to satisfy that craving. Didn't have any postshave options that matched the soap this time, so I just went with the classic EM (they didn't mix well, but when the soap scent faded it was alright).\n\nHad mixed experiences with this blade, this is my first time using a Personna Red and it seems like it alternates between tugging and tearing at my face and gliding perfectly. Luckily, last night was the latter and I got BBS on cheeks, chin, and even some parts under my jawline with DFS elsewhere and very little irritation in problem neck spots.",

Needed a 47 and made a 94. One more test next week then I'll be finishing up to enroll in school late summer. Thanks for the encouragement and support guys, much appreciated.\n\nI still love pairing Taiga with Sakura for a flowery woods scent. Added in the Cape Heartache and yikes... they weren't kidding about the strawberry. Once that died down, the frag turns into a nice warm, mellow vanilla that will probably go well with Night Music and Hallows. If only that strawberry didn't punch me in the nose so hard...\n\nFinally getting two nights off from work after working almost every night this month. Mexican food and await. Someone else is driving AND paying so I'm tempted to skip the food entirely...\n\nY'all have a good one!",

The Feather Professional blade gives a crazy smooth and efficient shave- loving the combo. I'm also pleasantly surprised at the quality of the Stirling brush; I have brushes that cost 4 times as much and this is every bit as good. Very dense, beautifully soft tips, simply phenomenal for the price. I highly recommend it.",

I'm still having a hard time getting a good lather from this soap. MLS is well known around here, so I'm sure it's something I'm doing incorrectly, but I can't quite place it. I was building until my arm was sore, but it still wound up being thin. On top of that, I got a few pretty substantial nicks from the Feather blade, and wasn't anywhere near as close as I normally get. All in all a sub par shave, by no fault of the gear whatsoever.\n\nJust got to keep working at dialing that lather in, and perfecting my technique!",

I picked up this one, a while back, with two vintage brushes and miscellaneous razors in it. One of those was a tech. That tech had a bent safety bar on one side, so I decided to try to bend it back to spec because I thought it would be fun. I definitely didn't get it bent back to spec, but I did get it straightened at least, which makes it pretty exciting to shave with. It has more blade feel than any tech in existence XD\n\nShe gave me a helluva shave though. The Dr. Jon's didn't hurt. Anyone who thinks that vegan soaps are inherently inferior to tallow soaps\n\n1. Is factually incorrect, and\n1. Needs to try Dr. Jon's soap right fucking now.\n\nThis stuff is an awesome performer in every respect. *13* is also a great scent. I love its jasmine note. I have literally nothing that will pair with it. *Beaudelaire* doesn't pair with it, but I really wanted *Beaudelaire* today, so there.\n\nHappy Friday, everyone. Enjoy your weekends!",

I'm thinking at least for a bit, I might only do ATG every other day - we'll see though. Quite a comfortable shave - got a good lather with the Stirling, and this blade seems like it might be a bit smoother than yesterday. Either that or I'm just starting to dial in the technique with the V3A a bit more.\n\nI did have one little weeper on my neck, and a few spots where there was a little bit of sting from the aftershave, but all around pretty darn good.\n\nHope everybody has a good day and good shave!",

Heljestrand No. 24 straight razor\n\n**Post**: Stirling Executive Man aftershave splash, Nivea sensitive post shave balm, Aveeno daily moisturizing lotion\n\nSR shave #10. First time using a quarter hollow, first time using a non-spike point. This razor didn't seem as sharp as the Wade & Butcher one I honed in the beginning, but I think it got better after the first WTG pass. Does that even make any sense? I flew dangerously close to the sun with some shady feeling passes, but managed to escape with one small nick on the right side of the chin. I did a lot of touch-ups after the 3rd pass this time around and although the chin area is pretty damn smooth for a SR shave the upper lip still kinda sucks. I'm tempted to stop chasing BBS but isn't having a goal the whole point of learning a new skill?\n\nI decided to stop using Martin de Candre for a day just so I can enjoy the awesome Stirling smells after the shave and I think I kinda see why MdC is a \"premier\" soap now. It just seems to lather so much easier than Stirling... but then again maybe that's just because I'm unsure how much water the Stirling needs and it takes me 3-4 tries to get the right amount of water on the brush. It is still interesting how the Stirling soap scents seem to last a while even after being washed off but the MdC is completely gone afterwards.",

The iKon Deluxe OC is one hell of a razor. Solid all around and much more tamable than other fully stainless razors out there. I realize there's not a lot of love around these parts for certain aspects of the iKon name, but this razor is excellent. It's well worth it's approximate $130 price point, IMO. Panty Dropper is a beauty. It's discontinuation is a shame, but that's sometimes the nature of artisanal beast.\n\nThe CL Y/R/P was the only CL toner that initially threw me for a loop. After a few more uses, it grew on me and my appreciation for it's scent profile is now in full force.\n\nEnjoy the weekend and obviously, enjoy the shaves. Otherwise, what's the point......",

The puck is quite hard and so required some extra loading but the reward was well worth it. Beautifully slick and all the protection needed for using the 1914.\n\nThe D01 3 band hair is very interesting. After its first run out I'd say it's a little scritchy but has fantastic scrub and decent backbone. Unlike some other brushes I own I felt like I could really go to town on the puck without damaging it. It's very dense but allows the lather to flow through nicely.\n\nFirst night out in a long time tonight and this shave has set me up fantastically.\n\nHave a good day people.",

Got my tub of the Special Edition Fougere Bouquet by Wholly Kaw yesterday and vowed to await the arrival of the matching Post Shave Toner before I did my first shave with it. Those plans lasted less than 12 hours!\n\nThis soap is fantastic! Sri's got mad skills, and I likee! Monaco Royale and this new Fougere Bouquet are my two favorites right now. I ordered the Stirling Soap Co.'s synthetic 24mm in the 51mm loft which arrived yesterday as well. As expected, it hits my personal sweet spot of surface area and stiffness. Looking forward to using it with my SdM which I keep in the smaller opening wooden bowl that Phil sells over at Bullgoose.\n\nI'm not particularly in love with the pairing of the CL - La Foret de Liguest (one of my favorites in /u/hawns stable of offerings), but until I get delivery of the true fougere toner from Sri it worked fine.\n\nWishing you gentlemen a great weekend!

My first use of an Eufros product and I see why it is in such demand. The soap was easy to lather, offered great protection, a wonderful scent and was one of the slickest soaps I've ever used. Both razors just glided across my face. One pass with the Supply and two with the Chimera and I'm close to BBS. It's getting easier to use this Chimera. Alum was mostly silent, slight tickle on my lower neck. The Eufros balm was nice; not greasy with a wonderful albeit short lived scent. I've been directed to a cologne that matches this scent pretty closely that I need to order. Have a great day folks!\n",

I've had the heavy hold pomade that he makes in this scent for a while and that's what made me eventually pick up the soap when he released *13.* No ragerts.\n\nI should probably accomplish something today, but I don't really see it happening.

The more I use it, the more I'm enjoying it. I think I may have finally found my daily driver. Again the only issue I have is a touch of irritation along the jawline. I seem to have a bit of trouble doing that area ATG.\n\nI'm going to use this Captain's Choice sample until I kill it - should only be two shaves at the most I would think. Super easy to make a good lather with the stuff. It's not quite as slick as B&M/L&L (and maybe even a bit behind Stirling in that department), but it has good post-shave feel and works pretty darn well.",

It's made with caster oil, coconut oil, tallow, glycerin, and kokum butter. Soap wasn't hard or croap, more like TOBS type consistency; [sample](https://imgur.com/gallery/5DNJt). Scooped out a dime size sample and smeared it on the bottom of my bowl, did a quick run of water over my brush and shook it out. Ended up with a few drops of water in the bowl but I just went with it. At first it was slightly a bit too foamy with tiny bubbles but as I started getting more soap on the brush and working the action it lathered up nice and thick with a good sheen. Layered on thick to my face no issues, didn't dry my skin out or anything. Good cushion, I didn't end up with any irritation or nicks thanks to a smooth blade. Okay now on to the scent it's a nice medicinal eucalyptus smell, reminds me of VapoRub. Cleared my nose cleared right up which is great since I've had the sniffles lately. Menthol was really cool on the face and just at the right point for me, too much more and I think I would be in Cryogen country. Overall great shave and looking forward to what's in the future.",

That really is an amazing soap. The scent is bright, but the spice is still there, and the slickness and post-shave are incredible. I was very impressed. I didn't even consider using an aftershave. This may be the best soap I've ever tried. My inner L&L fanboy wept a little, but I must give credit where credit is due. On a side note, the MLS shampoo bar was awesome too. I highly recommend picking one up.",

And to be honest, I was surprised: the razor is much milder than I thought - given that so many rave about the NEW and I found them to be very uncomfortable. Having said that, the shave itself was also not super close...I will try it with a Ladas next. The soap is for me more a croap/cream - in typical Italian fashion. And it was actually quiet nice. It took some decent amount of water, and the resulting [lather was very easy to build and shiny](http://i.imgur.com/QFO7w9Z.jpg). The scent was also quiet nice - not a dark Vetiver like Mike's, but more a grassy version. For some reason I also got some Fenugreek in there. The resulting post-shave was much better and less drying than the likes of Proraso. All in all an enjoyable Sunday shave.\n\n\n\n## I hope you all enjoy your shaves as well!",

Performance is good, but I'm not sure why I feel I'm getting better performance with my other B&M soaps. Just to confirm I used 42 yesterday and then using SoA so that my observation with the other soap is fresh in my mind.\n\nWith this said, my skin is extra sensitive, and I think SoA is a good soap. However my other B&M glissant is up there among my top and jives well with me.\n\nPerhaps my mind is playing tricks on me and they are the same base, but so far it's what I'm seeing.\n\nEnjoy the weekend, gents.",

It's amazing how much a nice lather can make a difference in how well a blade works. A good shave starts with a good lather.\n\nStill too wet to cut grass, but maybe I can get some bushes planted today.",

Invariably someone else comments that it is a difficult razor or it even has a design flaw. I have never understood any of that. I shaved almost exclusively with my 37C for a year and while it took a while to get used to it when I did I found it flawless even on a daily basis. It is a serious razor and has been around since about 1930 in many forms. It probably is not the razor for someone who doesn't do any prep, struggles with making quality lather and hasn't developed proper technique. For those that have paid their shaving dues it is as flawless a shaver and as enjoyable to use as a Gillette NEW SC.",

I can't say enough good things about this soap, it lathers easily, offers excellent protection and glide. I've been searching for a while for a scent to match up with this soap and I think I found it. This Oud Noir has a wonderful woody scent with a slight citrus note, it matches the Arctic Tundra well. One pass with the Supply, two with the Chimera and I'm left with a DFS. Have a great day folks!",

In short, I'll need more shaves to really get a solid perspective on the scent l, but I *can* say quite definitively that I like it.\n\nIt reads to me like a decidedly un-fruity citrus. More herbal, bitter, and a bit medicinal, even. Very much in the vein of L&L's Puzzle, CFG's Santa Paula, and even Razorock's The Dead Sea. I would call it more subtle than the first two, but pleasingly funky like Puzzle. I'd say that black pepper comes through clearly, and the woody basenotes fill everything out quite nicely.\n\nAnd the performance is, as always with Bufflehead, delightful. I've found that I get the best performance from Bufflehead when I really load a lot of product, as much as it pains me. But it's worth it. I was very disappointed to miss out on North York, but this tub more than makes up for it for me.",

The Asylum is great if you have a light to medium hair growth (in my opinion). I have a thick hair growth, and it wasn't really cutting it for me on my neck area.\n\nThe DOC on the other hand was by far much more efficient, while still being relatively smooth. I didn't even need a clean up pass, it was a 3 pass and done.\n\nOn another note, I love this Manchurian knot. It is so good that I don't reach for my synthetics anymore. Also, this Chanel scent I have now associated with Sundays. Growing up in a Church going family when I was younger, this scent would be the \"wear to church\" type scent.",

The lather this ass milk formula makes is just wonderful and feels so nourishing that I could probably forgo an aftershave (but that's no fun). The lather felt so nice that after my shave I squeezed the extra lather out of my brush and spread it across my face and just left it there.\n\nI also adore the scent. It's easily a top 3 scent for me personally. This may be my desert island soap... I'm starting to wish I'd ordered a backup tub. I can only hope Sri makes it a permanent offering. The scent is so good that the matching splash will definitely be my next shaving purchase.\n\nSpeaking of splash, I knew Unconditional Surrender wouldn't match the soap, but I had yet to try it (and none of my AS seems like a great match) so I wanted to give it a go. The scent changed a ton during the dry down and to me this is a good thing and it mellowed into a very pleasant, masculine scent. I have a very unsophisticated sense of smell so I cane describe it any better than that :(\n\n**TL,DR**: if you can get your hands on some ass milk Fougere Bouqet do it!!!!!",
