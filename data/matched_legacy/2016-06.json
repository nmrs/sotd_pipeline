The June Soap Challenge has finally arrived, and I am *pumped*.\n\n\nI've decided that for each day of the month, I'm going to do a short review of each soap. I'll be giving from 1 to 5 points based, in no scientific way whatsoever, on scent, performance, and anything else I deem relevant (yeah, like I said, not scientific).\n\n\nFirst up is our Vegan soap. I wanted to kick the month off with something a little different. While hunting for good Wild Card soaps for later in the month, I came across a number of local soap makers, and this soap by \"Purple Urchin\" caught my attention. It's locally made, and 100% vegan. The scent is described as \"cedarwood, balsam fir, and bergamont with a hint of vanilla.\" Off the puck it smells great; very woodsy, but not overpowering.\n\nThat's about where I stop with the positive aspects. Once I started lathering, the soap scent practically disappeared. What was\nstrong and pleasant off the puck, became minute and barely noticeable once I started *trying* to whip up a lather. *Trying* is the operative word here - this is clearly an example of a generic soap maker adding bentonite clay to a body soap and passing it off as a shave product. The \"lather\" was bubbly, thin, and completely lacked slickness. I actually tried with both my Semogue 830, and a synthetic, but neither could achieve better than the badger. After accumulating a sad, frothy mess, I did one quick WTG pass for the sake of the competition, and called it quits. The good news, if there is any, is that I now have a pleasant smelling body soap for the shower, which is clearly what this is more suited to.\n\nI will be giving Purple Urchin's Lumberjack, 1 star out of 5: *\n\nAt the very least, I still smell great, because Cologne Russe. Thanks B&M, for coming to my rescue, though it burned more than usual applying the aftershave after that abomination of a shave.\n\nHahaha, I'm off to a great start.\n\n**June Soap Challenge Running Total: 1 theme complete, 1 unique soap used**",

The shaver heaven is nice, but all the scents are very sweet. It creates a big thick lather when worked well. The senator continues to impress me.\n\nAs a side project during these lather games, I'm going to try to start taking some pics of my SOTD. Hopefully I'll improve those skills from potato pic to serviceable.

I definitely don't need more soap, but I would really consider buying (and almost have a few times) some DR Harris cream. Love the scent of Windsor and it has just enough vetiver in it - at least to my nose - to let me use the new Fine A/S. Not like the other soaps I have are difficult to lather, but it is nice to scoop out a dab of cream and whip up lather in seconds with a synthetic sometimes.\n",

Nice way to start out the June Challenge and the menthol was very appropriate for how ridiculously hot it is around these parts lately.",

I also opted for this bone scaled chopper that's on loan because this will be the only day I have a few days growth to mow through, sorry not a complete vegan theme but it's the only time I could justify using a razor with this much heft.\n\nThe shave was actually pretty damn smooth. I did get some minor burn on my cheeks due to excessive pressure but all in all I'm pretty pleased. The weight of this made ATG passes on my jawline a breeze and the slight smiling edge made getting in my neck pockets quite simple. Fuck yeah I have a good feeling about this coming month.\n\nHappy shaves!",

A few years ago in the fall I was searching for fall scented soaps to try and this one sounded nice. I enjoy the scent of this soap and quite honestly, lathers really well and from my limited experience it performs well. I have not used this soap for some time since it was re-branded and I struggled to use something I could never replace. This challenge will be a nice way to break out the few soaps I enjoy but will most likely never be able to replace them.\n\nI don't have enough soaps for everyday this month so my alternate plan is to use up my samples. It's going to be a good month.\n\n**June Challenge**\n**Days Completed: 1**\n**Unique Soaps: 1**",

Maybe I'll add any commentary on the shave the following morning with the next SOTD post. On that note, I got another great lather from my 620 last night, which I had been struggling with for some time.\n\nAlso, I really like the performance and scent on the SC soap, but why does every soap they sell come with the words \"Vegan Edition,\" on them?

I would never miss the games.\n\nSamantha and I were recently accused of using SOTD posts as subliminal advertising which is kinda funny since our post frequency is so low. Either way, this is your warning; I will be using MLS products liberally throughout this month. Prepare to be marketed to!\n\n\nAs with last years challenge I intend to complete each themed shave without repeating any soap or aftershave. Today was HeV C&CC. Before I tried this soap I was very skeptical of this scent as it is named almost exactly the same as a very common, low quality FO. Boy was I wrong, this stuff smells great and the soap itself is very good as well. The aftershave is a bit too high on the menthol for me but I'll continue to suffer through it for the scent.\n\n\nThe Mergress XL came to me by way of /u/SethH and I've been hooked on it for about 6 weeks now. Very enjoyable shave with a huge range of blade gaps.\n\n\nLast years challenge was great fun and brought about some really cool completion methods and self-imposed side challenges. I'm looking forward to seeing what comes out of this years Games.",

When you're pissed off at someone and you're angry at them, you just haven't given them enough time. Just give them a little more time and they almost always will impress you.\" -Randy Pausch\n\n- Prep: Stirling mentholated preshave soap, hot towel\n- Brush: Razorock Plissoft\n- Soap: The Holy Black Goldrush\n- Razor: Standard\n- Blade: Trig\n- Aftershave: B&M Arctique Tonique\n\nGoldrush is in THB's new hot process vegan formula. It's an easy lathering, good performing soap, and the ceramic pot it's in is nice. There's apparently a gold nugget in there somewhere, but I haven't dug for it. The scent is peppermint and vanilla, sweeter and more gourmand than what I typically go for, but I do like it. The Arctique splash goes well with it, and is almost, almost too cold.\n\n/u/shawnengland gave me a few Trig blades to try at the Maggard meetup. They remind me a lot of Sharks, for me both are exceptionally smooth, comfortable blades, giving that \"did I forget to put a blade in the razor?\" sensation. However with both I don't get quite as close of a shave. My hypothesis is that blades like this are made of blade stock that is slightly narrower (distance from sharp edge to sharp edge) than most other blades, as that would explain my experience of them. But I don't really know if that's the case.",

I had no desire to restock my samples after months of using them up (I still haven't used them all). So I will just use what I can, when I can. Many of my soaps will be crossovers for other days. I thought about seeing how few soaps I could use and still be on theme, burn that requires effort. I'm too lazy for that shit.\n\nAnyway, this is my wife's favorite scent of all the soaps I have. It's a pretty damn good soap, but it doesn't quite reach the very top tier. It's close, very close, but there are others that perform just a tad better. It's still a good value and a puck will last forever. Now...of to another day of drudgery.",

      "body": "**Backward with Time - Vegan Vednesday**\n\nLet the Lather Games begin!\n\nIn addition to using the theme lather each day for the June Challenge Lather Games, I'm going to try something else to make the game more challenging for me. As the title indicates, I'm planning on a little trip through the history of safety razors..and music. I will use a different razor every day, starting with 2014 when I first discovered the wet shaving forums here on reddit (I'd been wet shaving for several years before that). Each day I will step backwards in terms of date (some are the same year). In some cases, I'm making an educated guess at age because many of my razors predate the date codes and/or are not Gillettes...and I'm lazy. I'll try to take selected pics of the razors I like the most. As for music, stay tuned.\n\nJust for fun, if anyone guesses in today's comments what my final razor is, I will send you something nice (probably soap, but negotiable).\n\nOn to today's shave:\n\n**Pre:** Shower, MLS Sandalwood Pre\n\n**Lather:** Damn Handsome American Ale\n\n**Brush:** Plisson\n\n**Razor:** RazoRock Stealth Slant (2014)\n\n**Blade:** Gillette Platinum Plus (1)\n\n**Post:** Thayer's Witch Hazel\n\n**After:** Damn Handsome American Ale AS Balm\n\nSo the Damn Handsome was a gift my wife picked up at the local apothecary. It has a pleasant scent and decent lather...and most importantly, it's vegan!\n\nSo excited for the rest of the challenge. Happy Wednesday!",

The Castile soap I used is vegan and cruelty free, and definitely smells like orange. The scent doesn't linger, so it's a nice scent to start the day.\n\nMy 28mm synth seemed like the appropriate choice for the occasion, so I went with that. It doesn't see too much use, but it was perfect for today. This is my first go with any of the Stubble Trubble offerings. The scent off the puck is orange, and when lathered opens up nicely. It says blood orange, cucumber, and mint, but I didn't get too much mint out of it. It may have what toned down the cucumber, which can sometimes be pretty strong in my experience. Also, I think my mind was playing tricks on me, but it almost felt like there was an ever so slight cooling effect, like menthol extra light or something (was that the mint?)\nIt lathered up nicely, slick, with a nice light post feel.\n\nDespite the many variables I have thrown into today's shave, I did use a few tried and true items. The WR1-OC loaded with a Kai never does me wrong, so I went with that rig.\n\nFor post I went with the Chatillon Lux Colonia Balsamica. I felt it paired well with today's theme, plus it's just awesome stuff!\n\nOverall, today's shave went very nicely! DFS, and nothing unpleasant whatsoever. I'm even going to have vegan meals today! How do you like them apples?\n\n=P\n\n\n",

The lather is easy, generous, slick, and much, much more moisturizing than the first formulation of The Holy Black's new artisan line. Really good stuff. Plus the presentation is quite nice. And I definitely had to fit it in somewhere this month, because I'm desperate to see if I've struck it big with my nugget and I'm determined to do it as intended.\n\nThe AlumiGoose. Wow. I'm only one shave in, but I'm worrying about the future of my S1. This is a remarkable razor.

I remembered that Scrumtrulescent was a pretty hard soap, so the Semogue was the smart choice (though I'm sure the envy white would've been just as good). Actually I should've used a synthetic to stick with the theme.. WHELP. So I've already shared my thoughts on this soap before; it's my fat day soap. It's indulgently sweet, but not overly so. I couldn't figure out what to pair it with, so I used Lavanille. I'm pretty sure I'm going to need a Drunken Goat set to solve my problem.\n\nYesterday I ran my first PCR reaction (which you throw some DNA and polymerase and shit into little vials, then run it in a machine which cycles temperatures and you get a buttload more DNA) yesterday which was cool. I'm gonna run gels on them on Tuesday. It's kinda sad that I've never done a PCR during college as a bio major, but I mean I was in an eco evo lab at the time.. \\o/ Today's work day with my internship, so at least I'll be making money. Personal statements are out to friends to edit; then I'll probably open it up to strangers on the Internet to read \\o/ yay for pre-meddit. Happy Vednesday!\n\n____________________________\n**Days Completed:** 1/30\n**Unique Soaps Used:** 1",

Decided on a Personna Blue as it's normally a good performer for me. The blade seemed more exposed on one side than the other and no amount of adjusting could even it out. Even managed to cut my thumb with the tab on the side of the blade trying to adjust it. Lots of weepers and irritation. I own a 39c and the Fine is definitely more aggressive. One of the rougher shaves I've had in a while. Snake Bite burns like Cocytus in the ninth circle of hell but in a good way. I've had this sample for over a year and while I enjoy it I miss smelling like something. The temptation to spray a fragrance was strong.\n\nOnly the second day of this short week and it feels like an eternity. We're almost halfway to the weekend...",

It'll never be my favorite, but it always gets down to business and makes a great lather. The MR5 / V3A gave its usual effortless BBS shave.

I did the games last year and I got around to knowing a lot of soaps. I ended up acquiring a case of the SAD. I figured hey... since we're challenging ourselves to new themes etc why not extend that towards another vice? I'll be pairing my SOTD's with a new beer/drink/protein shake. Since today's was vegan I decided to pair it with a gluten-free spirit, Tequila!\n\nTopanga Fougere is probably my favorite offering from LASSCo in regards to scent. The bright floral fougere is just fantastic and persists through the lathering. Some soaps change their scent profile or potency once off the tub and into the lather but LASSCo's Topanga only improves. Pair it with the BBS-1 and vooooila. Oh yeah my frags and AS for today are all over the place but then again they always are. 42 is a nice bright citric floral and the SJoL is a bright peppery-fresh lime note.\n\n\n\nAs for Don Julio Anejo? Probably my favorite brand of Tequila that is readily available. Go for the Anejo though! Their Blanco and Reposado lines are great but their Anejo is a completely different animal. Its just such a soft and smooth offering with a buttery honey opening and ends in a spicier bright finish. Other Anejo.\n\n\n\nLets hope my DoTD and SoTD doesn't leave me with another case of SAD and a side crippling alcoholism.",

I think I did very well. I was pretty nervous, but I tried my best not to show it, I know there was SO much more I could have said for my concluding statements but I forgot it all, despite practicing for days! Funny how that happens.\n\nAnyway, good shave this morning! I was surprised to see this container of Strop Shoppe, I have their big 6 o.z plastic tubs, is this their latest formula before closing shop?\n\nScent is great on this, it's probably my favorite now since its so clean and fresh. I wanted a mild shave for my 1 day hair growth and the super adjustable did not fail, clean BBS with a sharp feather blade. 4711 is delicious haha, the scent anyway, Sharp citrus scent I love it.\n\nHave a great Wednesday guys :)",

Harris Arlington\n-Brush: H&V Luxurious Badger Shaving Brush (review of this at a later date)\n-Blade: Astra SP\n-Razor: Slim\n-Post: Dr Jon's Savanah Sunrise\n\nAfter yesterday's craptacular shave, I was looking forward to something more proven today, and D.R. Harris has stepped up to the plate.\n\nI really like Arlington's scent. It's not particularly novel, but it's classic, and pleasant. I get a lot of the citrus, but it's not an in your face citrus - a little more subdued.\n\nPerformance is pretty typical of these top-shelf, triple-milled, tallow soaps - above average in all categories. Nice and slick, and plenty protective - this stuff feels very good. While the post shave isn't as nice as MWF, it's perfectly acceptable, and D.R. Harris is much easier to lather. Presentation, offered in a variety of bowls (mine is mahogany), is great. Again typical of these soaps, the cost is a bit high, but the puck will last a while.\n\nI'll give D.R. Harris 4 out of 5 stars. ****\n\nReally good stuff.\n\nWent with Savanah Sunrise, not because it's a similar scent, but because they both felt pleasantly summer-y.\n\n\n**June Soap Challenge Running Total: 2 themes complete, 2 unique soaps used**\n\nEdit: missing word.",

Two passes and I'm pretty much bbs except for my neck because it's not worth it there.\n\nThis SV soap base is a good step forward. It lathers easier and post shave is a bit nicer.

I can play today! So that motivated me. That and I woke up early for no good reason, and that and I have 5 hours of meetings today.\n\nI went with the Schick I because it's considered to be mild. I think it did a good job with the minimal growth I had. This is also my second day using /u/mrtooniceguy's aftershave booster and it seems nice so far. I've been using 1 drop and it seems to add a nice softness to my normal alcohol splash.\n\nOverall a little irritation but it was sort of to be expected. But I got to play! That's what's really important, right?",

I usually pitch my blades after using them 5-6 times because they are cheap and I have a hundred of them. Many moons ago I used to milk as many shaves out of a clogged, dull cartridge. Since switching to wet shaving four or five years ago I've vowed to never use a blade that long. I decided today, in order to make things more interesting, I will be attempting to use the same blade for the entire lather games (plus the two shaves it had on it prior).",

It is floral straight off of the puck but once it is lathered it you really get more of the masculine scents from the fragrance profile. Overall I think the performance is good but I have never had the best of luck when lathering from samples so I am sure that is a contributing factor. It has performed well enough for me I will most likely pick up a tub of something. I am having a hard time deciding between this, Sherlock and Cedar & Spice.",

I bought a Slim on eBay that appeared in perfectly good shape, but I really wanted the Delta Echo look for it, so I had it sent directly to Jay. This thing is gorgeous, and it shaves so well! Being able to adjust between passes resulted in an ultra-smooth final pass (set on 3), with no tugging on getting stuck while going ATG. I highly recommend his services, and will be enjoying this razor as my daily driver for some time to come.\n\nAlso, Anne Bonnie just smells so good. I'm trying to finish up my small tin so that I can justify buying a bigger one, and add the splash to the mix!",

This was my first time using it and I found that the performance was really there. I've seen a few other reviews of this new Fine hard soap that found it didn't really stack up to Tabac's performance, but I thought it was fantastic.\n\nThe scent is really light off the dry puck, but comes up nicely when you lather it. It actually smells a little more like authentic Guerlain Vetiver EdT than the aftershave: less lemony and more walnut-y. Still has that same nice vetiver-and-cigarettes core as the aftershave.\n\nThe matching Fine aftershave would be the natural choice to follow it, but I wanted an orange-colored aftershave today to match [the orange shirt I'm wearing today.](http://wearorange.org/) I can't say Floïd Vigoroso really goes with Green Vetiver at all, but it doesn't clash either.",

Phoenix & Beau Spitfire headed your way soon.\n\n**2014** This was the year that I discovered shaving forums online and went from wet shaving on a budget to a ridiculous glutton of shaving. **Music:** \"Happy\" from Pharrell Williams was the top song this year with Meghan Trainor's \"All About That Bass\" coming in number 2. Joe Cocker, Phil Everley and Pete Seeger were among those we lost in 2014.\n\nOn to today's shave:\n\n**Pre:** Shower, MLS Sandalwood Pre\n\n**Lather:** DR Harris Windsor\n\n**Brush:** Mühle Black Fibre\n\n**Razor:** iKon DLC Slant (2014)\n\n**Blade:** Gillette Platinum Plus (2)\n\n**Post:** Thayer's Witch Hazel, Alum\n\n**After:** PdP Shea Butter AS Balm\n\n\nThe iKon is the last \"modern\" razor I will use this month. This was a huge purchase for me...kind of a \"crossing the Rubicon\" moment in wet shaving. I really don't like it very much. I seem to cut myself almost every time I use it...and I frequently use \"aggressive\" SEs and OCs with no issues. Had to break out the alum today.\n\nThe DR Harris is really nice. I am pleasantly surprised at how much I liked this cream. Excellent lather and a great scent. I guess there is something to the thrice milled thing.\n\n\nHappy Thursday!",

This mornings rushed shave was flawless. I'm feeling really comfortable with the straight and have a nice system down where I minimize passes emphasizing on efficiency. This month is going to fly by!\n\nThe previous wedge that I used didn't do it for me but these larger ones have surprised me with how great they feel in the hand. I want one.\n\nHappy shaves gents!\n\nEdit: Fixed razor size\n\nEdit #2: MdC isn't triple Milled, I'm an idiot. Swapping today with tomorrow with permission from Ragged.",

I hadn't used my Edwin Jagger in a while and was surprised at how great the lather was. I had never used it with this brush either and I can probably attribute it to just getting better at my lather technique. This combination of soap, balm, and frag worked incredibly well.

The Le Marche du Rasage is my first and only CB soap. Historically I've not had much luck with veggie soaps, so I was **very** happy when I first shaved with this one. The lather from the new Luxury Cream base is *unbelievable*. I've used it 3 times now and, like the B&M Glissant, it just makes me smile seeing how creamy the lather is. It's like a mix between Cool Whip and Fluff. Cushion? Yeah, I'd say so. Slick too. But for me at least, there's a very faint burning during the shave that blooms into full on irritation post-shave. And this makes me sad.\n\n:-('''''",

Ended up breaking off a small chunk and smashing the fuck out of it into the bottom of a bowl and loaded from there. I had the perfect amount too if I loaded just a *tad* longer. I really like this scent! I think I'm going to end up buying the Fine Santal Absolut set down the line.\n\nConsulted with my friends and my mom gave me comments from her friend re: my personal statement. Long story short, I'm going to rewrite it LOL. This time, I'm going to have a little more fun with it. I have a theme that I'm going to be interweaving throughout it and hopefully the end product won't have to get scrapped. I have a basic outline in my head, but I'm going to have a hard time putting some meat on those bones. Going to take off work an hour early just to grind it out at a Peet's or something\n\n____________________________\n**Days Completed:** 2/30\n**Unique Soaps Used:** 2\n\n",

Last night (CB LMR) was first shave I used Fatboy with in about a week or so, and keep forgetting how much I love it, great shave and really enjoy the weight on it.\n\nFor tonight's shave however, going to test out the YRP for the first time, and because it's in toner form, will probably just use a small bit to test irritation out. I really enjoy the sniffs I've gotten from it out of the sample so far tho, and will likely revisit it in salve. Was trying to decide between the YRP and LQV as they were the only scents available that I hadn't tried yet, but LQV seemed to be a bit earthier and didn't fit as well with the powderiness of the Tabac.\n\nHey I'm 2/2 on this challenge so far!

Neumann &amp;amp; Company - Heartwood\n\nFor today's shave, I went for the scrubbiest brush I own to tackle the triple milled soap. This soap doesn't feel as slick for me as many of the others I use regularly. The post leaves something to be desired for me too. This could partly be due to a fairly aggressive razor.\n\nToday's Razor is an early post patent Ever-Ready 1914, this one has zero problem holding the blade in place, but felt a little more aggressive than the first 1914 I used, but that could be due to the lather. I'll try again tomorrow.\n\nPost is something I don't see around these parts too often, but I opted for WM. Neumann &amp;amp; Co. - Heartwood. I get a big whiff of bergamot, some wood, and a little medicinal/herbal scent, something else I can't quite put a name to but is present, and an ever so slight hint of spiciness in the background. My nose isn't very well trained, but those are the scents I am picking up. The face feel is light, but feels like I used something more healing than a splash. Very nice. Thanks /u/designtofly for the samples!\n\nI hope everyone has a great day!\n\n\n",

Not sure why there's really any hate because the performance is exactly what people should look for in a shave soap. Even the scent is nice and \"masculine,\" but with that said I do understand scent is very subjective.\n\nAnywho, after having used my synth for the better part of 6 months while deployed to the sandbox and using my PK-47 since I got back, my 620 had been neglected. Today made me realize why it was the first brush I got because face lathering with it is just fantastic; it's such an affordable brush that feels great and performs well above its price tag.\n\nFirst go with Fresh Fine Vetiver and it smells pretty good. Not much else to say as the performance is already rather well known.\n\n**Shave: 2 of 30**\n**Soaps used: 2**",

Very VERY lightly scented but pleasant. Every time I shave with it I am left with a very nice post shave feel and just buttery smooth skin. For $12 a tub-less puck is well worth the investment and since it is triple-milled the lather damn near explodes off the puck and lasts forever. I received this from /u/wishbound a year ago and use it quite regularly... Damn thing still doesn't have a dent in it.\n\n\nAs for Allagash Tripel? Get that too! It is oooOoo man it is one of my \"I could drink this for life and never feel like I'm missing out\" . It is deep complex flavor that consists of citrusy, floral, and spicy notes(clove/cardamom)in a slightly creamy delivery as far as a tripel is concerned. Nothing as creamy as the Nitro Milk Stout by Left Hand but still good. /u/amanforallsaison get on this yo!\n\nGood shave and Good Brew!\n\n",

Nobody needs to see a ramekin. This is my first go with LPL and I have to say I'm pretty happy. I know some said the smell was a bit strange but I really like it. I mostly get lavender. Plenty slick when it's slathered up but doesn't leave a lot behind but that's alright. I don't do much buffing after the lather is gone anyway. I can almost do 30 different manufacturers for the month but I think I'm going to fall just short. I'll have to repeat when it comes to some of the Artisan days. The Azzaro Nighttime is pretty nice stuff. Smells like the original but quite a bit brighter. Not sure what's nighttime about it though. If I remember correctly it would go very well with MLS Cape Verde.",

Cade. Cade is awesome.\n\nSuper slick, super easy to lather, super great shave. This is one of those soaps where you have to nitpick for faults. It's not cheap, and while it's entirely subjective, I really need to be in the mood for the scent (quite woodsy), which I'm not super crazy about. The post shave is only okay.\n\nStill, that is only nitpicking, and Cade is good shit.

Got all these new goodies from /u/drivenlegend (including his volunteered time to set the knot for me). The Triad handle is definitely a keeper, perfect length and grip for me. The C&R brush handle (from /u/Eighchops) is simply amazing. The Romera Manchurian bulb has so much backbone it makes me realize how much I've missed by not paying attention to this one piece of hardware. That might trigger my brush addiction disorder but oh well.\n\n\nAnd now, SMdF. I have to admit I was really skeptical. My experience so far with RazoRock soaps had been pretty uneventful -- just meh. So I was wondering: why do people want to have a stash of SMdF jars as backup? Why does /u/Quadricwan talk about it all the time like that? Well, now I understand. I'm terrible at describing scents, and no need for me to do it here since you all already know what the scent is about, but I can definitely say I'm now completely sold on the scent (and performance), too. Even after only one shave with it. Top shelf already...\n\nTraveled way too much these past two weeks, so taking the day off and spending time with my daughters this afternoon. Have a fantastic Friday everyone!",

This tiger blade seems like it's straight out of the '30s. It has only 3 holes so I can't use them with any TTO razors and it's a thick carbon steel blade. It seemed ok, but nothing great.\n\nI had originally tried to use my baby smooth razor, but the curve of the head was too much for this blade. It snapped before I could tighten down the handle.\n\nI have a day off and my brother who's in the navy is in town for my daughters baptism this weekend. Super excited to see my nephews today at the zoo. And yes we will watch them carefully to ensure they don't fall into any animal exhibits.\n\nTomorrow at the Reds game my brother gets the honor of hometown hero. They recognize military members by letting them stand on the Reds dugout and the fans give a standing ovation for their service as a picture of them is on the scoreboard. They give a brief bio and the crowd goes nuts. It's a really awesome thing and is best when it's a WW2 vet. I'm really proud of him.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/Iilfb\n\nDays completed: 3\n\nSoaps used: 3",

I like aggressive razors and this one is even too much for me to use as a daily driver. When I picked up this razor the gent who sold it to me advised to make sure you had the morning coffee in you. He wasn't lying, this razor will tear you apart if you don't pay attention!\n\n\nMy other take away today is how far synthetic brushes have come since the Plisson first hit the market. I hadn't used this brush in quite sometime and was shocked with how I used to think this brush was the creme de la creme of brushes.

FH) on loan courtesy of /u/Golddragon\n\n- **Post:** Fine Platinum\n\nWell I'm an idiot. I was informed yesterday that MdC isn't a triple milled soap so Captain /u/Raggedclaws is allowing me to swap days. I guess /u/sunderka also made the same mistake last year.\n\nExcellent shave today, Tabac is great stuff and would be my go to traditional if I found myself short on shaving funds. It's weird using a hollow after a few days with a few large wedges, I'm missing that weight that did all the work for me. After a good stropping and shave I can really appreciate the quality of this Engels, the razor is just magnificent in function, it's beauty is just a bonus.\n\nSmall rant, I'm ready to burn down my local post office. I've recently had repetitive issues with packages arriving and being sent out. I've had to start sending goods from another location near my work to avoid issues. I've got two missing necklaces and a kamisori but they were kind enough to [leave me this](http://imgur.com/gWDiXEC). Who does this? Let alone that note is a day late :/\n\n\nHappy Friday shaves to all!",

My fiancé and I are getting married exactly 1 year from today here. Our day includes The Dune Climb at Sleeping Bear Dunes National Park and engagement photos later.\n\nThis is my first time using the brush /u/landlgrooming custom made for me for the wedding. I'll use it sparingly to break it in and today felt like an appropriate day. The handle is a chubby design with our wedding colors; peach and blue. It looks wonderful and feels great. Scott did an excellent job!",

I've heard that the older version (the one I am currently using) is slightly more harsh, not by much, but noticeable. Now having used this razor with a familiar lather, I've decided tomorrow will I will be using the newer version 1914 to see for myself if I can feel a difference.\n\nHappy Friday everyone!",

The scent of the soap is pleasant, albeit pretty light (but that might also be because I've had this sample lying around for months). And that's saying something, since I don't really like Lavender based scents! Probably has to do with the herbal scents in there balancing it out (rosemary and mint iirc?). I'll definitely be down the try the fougere in the future, though I'd probably just buy a sample off someone first; the price is a little too steep for a blind buy (unless I somehow manage to get to France and visit the shop).\n\nThat being said, I did find it lacking in residual slickness and post shave feel. My face didn't feel as moisturized as it would with most of the artisans we have. I can see why it was once highly regarded, but there's so much more competition now! That said, I do have really hard water, so maybe I'll try a distilled water shave or something to really see what the hype's about.\n\n____________________________\n**Days Completed:** 3/30\n**Unique Soaps Used:** 3\n\n",

This time around however I used my synth and I've gotta say the lather and performance was pretty darn good. A synth really is easy to dial in the perfect lather, so much so if you had an underwhelming experience with a soap (that is well reviewed) it might be worth giving it a try with a synth instead.\n\nFirst real go with B&M Wonderbalm and the moisturization is ridiculous. The scent is a bit herbal and it's an oil based post shave rather than a lotion/true \"balm.\" So keeping that in mind it is oily during and after application but it's not heavy or suffocating. The first shave this week was a bit rough so I'm glad the soaps I've used since this kicked off has minimized continued irritation and I feel the WB will further help repair my face as I continue through the weekend.\n\n**Shave: 3 of 30**\n**Diff soaps used: 3**",

There is little to no blade exposure and it was a real challenge to get a shave out of it.

I've only used the razor a few times and didn't remember how nice it shaves. I don't know why it was made in such small numbers and for such a short period of time. I was inspired to use by /u/sunderka1987. He's been using his a lot lately. The fresh cut lime scent that comes off this soap is exactly why this was my very first artisanal soap purchase at Maggard's store. It's raining here, so no yard work today. The local strawberry festival is going to be soggy as well. Maybe I'll just be lazy today. Yeah...that sounds good.\n\nEdit: I can't format for shit.",

      "body": "\n\n**[2016 Lather Games Day 4](http://imgur.com/XJ5sIut)**\n*Citrus Saturday*.\n\n\nA quote for today:\n\"When you're ass-deep in lemons, you start looking for a shovel, not a pitcher and a cup of sugar.\" -Melissa DiCarlo.\n\n\n- Prep: Stirling mentholated preshave soap, hot towel\n- Brush: Simpsons Commodore X3\n- Soap: Barrister & Mann Latha Limon\n- Razor: Gem Micromatic bullet-tip\n- Blade: Gem PTFE coated\n- Aftershave: Chatillon Lux Colbeck\n- Beverage: Hendricks & tonic, plenty of lime\n\nI've been torn between using the soap I like best for each theme vs. maximizing the variety of soaps over the course of the month. I shouldn't have a problem hitting each theme with a different soap, but I was trying to also not use any brand more than once, and that was leading to some weird gymnastics in putting together a schedule, and a couple days where I'd be using something I consider subpar just to avoid using a brand is scheduled used again. I've decided to eff that and just use what I like best (or am most interested in trying) for each theme, which mostly means multiple appearances of B&M, starting with today.\n\nLatha Limon's scent is simple but perfect. Lots of lemon, some orange to sweeten it, and that rose. It's a citrus scent but it's the rose that really makes it.\n\nThe brush I picked up at the Maggards meetup. I had wanted a Commodore fire a long time, but ended up getting distracted by other brushes. I bought a Duke 2 at some point and it really turned me off of Simpsons Best hair. Poky and scritchy. But I figured I'd I could actually handle a brush before I bought it, I could get some idea how the knot felt before buying it. So I rubbed a couple circles on the inside of my wrist and it felt good.\n\n\nAnd it translated into a much better experience than I had with the Duke 2 Best. It's a great, scrubby addition to my brush collection, and I've always really liked the handle shape.\n\nI have not used my bullet tip Micromatic in a while. I really think it's one of the prettiest razors out there. There was a time where pretty much all I used was SE razors, mostly this bullet-tip and an Ever Ready 1914. But after I picked up a Standard, that started getting about half my shaves. And when I got into injectors they displaced the SEs for the most part, as they have most of the advantages of an SE while also being really maneuverable and easy to use.\n\nMy opinion of the bullet tip suffered: it's ultimately too mild, and it doesn't balance well in the hand.\n\nBut this shave it really performed well. Not too mild, felt good in my hand. Still a pain in the neck to get right under the nose, though.\n\n/u/hawns upcoming gin-based aftershave splash, Colbeck, is really great. Super refreshing, big dose of menthol. I've taken to slapping some on whether I need to cool down a bit-- coming in from doing yard work, etc.\n",

The bright scent of the Acure Tropical Citrus was nice to help get the day started.\n\nLathered up the SdP no problem, but slightly overloaded and ended up taking a little longer and was messier than normal, but whatevs! This stuff smells great! Does what it says on the tin! It's lime and basil, similar to London Barbershop, but milder. Nice and slick with residual slickness. For minor touch ups I only needed to add a little more water and it was ready to go. Post face feel is great! Thanks /u/chill31613 ! Just by happenstance, this is 3 for 4 vegan soaps for the month...I never would have guessed that was going to happen =P\n\nYesterday I had mentioned the roughness of the older style 1914 I had, so today I would go with the newer version. My face told me no, but I said yes. And yes, there was a noticeable improvement for me in smoothness. Yay!!! Nice shave, a little residual irritation from yesterday and the day before, so I was easy on those areas, paying close attention as not to irritate further.\n\nPost shave I went for 42. It's Citrus Saturday so why not have more citrus! This time it's lemon. I have also added some menthol crystals to about 5ml of this to try today too. I made a great decision in doing this! Hell yeah!!!\n\nSo in review, I've used Orange, Lime, and Lemon today. It's like a [mufuggin' fruit salad breakfast](http://imgur.com/AQpu859) up in here!!!\n\n=P\n\nOverall a great shave! Hope everyone else has a good one too!!!\n\n\n=P",

It lost about 6-7 this shave. I don't know what happened to it. That said, I *did* just clean it out with shampoo and conditioner 1-2 days ago if that could've fucked up the glue in the knot. I hope not. I also hope it gets softer soon, it's too scrubby to be used as a daily driver (but I guess that's what brush rotations are for).\n\nAnyway, on to the soap. Hydra is my first Dr. Jon's soap and I really enjoy this scent. It's just a clusterfuck of a bunch of citrus scents that smack you in the face. Like a hydra, as soon as you figure one scent out, 2 pop up in its place. Post-shave was surprisingly nice, though the slickness isn't as good as others I've used. Definitely worth revisiting.\n\nNow the toner (/u/hawns I'll keep you tagged in these). NO BURNING, even with a liberal application! I don't know if it's an ingredient omission or a change in concentration, but it works for me. I'll randomly pick from 1, 3, and 4 tomorrow as well. I'd assume 3 shaves with each toner will give me a pretty good idea of how they work for me.\n\nFor anyone with CL salves, have yours ever melted? I think mine melted in the mail and separated; should I reheat them and mix them up again or am I good using them as-is?\n\n____________________________\n**Days Completed:** 4/30\n**Unique Soaps Used:** 4\n\n\n",

The scent evolves so much in the lathering. It's definitely not unlike peeling an orange. In the tub it smells quite bitter and oily, but once lathered it opens up and softens/sweetens a good bit. Not to say that this is a juicy, or even particularly fruity, scent though. It is very clearly the smell of an orange grove rather than an orange. And huge props for that, this is definitely one of my favorite citrus-forward scents (the others that come readily to mind are Seville and Cheshire), and definitely my favorite 'citrus' scent.\n\nY/R/P was also a treat. Much lighter than my usual fair, and the interplay between the yuzu and rose reminds me of pear, which I love. Good stuff.\n\nDays completed: **4/30**\n\nUnique soaps: **4**",

Either way this is a top notch shaving cream, still not as good as a lot of soaps in the den but it's leagues better than any cream I've tried. Tomorrow though, I am using some Cade for the first time so that should supposedly dethrone CForbes right? Happy shaving gents!",

After a long, exhausting week, I had a work function last night. Then I tried to work some when I got home, but I was too tired to get much done. Ended up sleeping for 10 hours, which really pissed me off, but damned if I don't feel much better. Worked a little bit more, then went and had coffee at a great shop I used to work down the street from. I prefer to make my own coffee vs coffee shops usually, but the company was fun and the place is nice.\n\nBut the shave? Damn, Mike's isn't the best at one thing, but it's really great at a lot of stuff. It's a scent I'll be looking for much more often now that the weather is getting hot.",

Because of the company it seems to be date-able to a fairly narrow time span (1850-1852).

I use it sparingly because I want it to last, and I don't want to run out. I do have Maggard's **Bergamot and Limes**, which was the first soap I ever got, but I like Shaver Heaven's so much more. I also contemplated using **First Canadian Shave Soap's Esther's**, which is peppermint and grapefruit - but Citrus Garden was the best citrus soap I have, and the theme called for it. It's just so good.\n\nI could have also used The Holy Black's **Ramos Gin Fizz** which is equally good, but I wanted to to be on theme.",

Several reviewers agreed that its initial scent is closely related to a urinal cake. I likened it to the blue liquid that fills the bottom of a port-a-potty. The reviewers also said to apply Lilac Vegetal then give it about 20 minutes for that initial slap of urinal cake to give way to a floral scent.\n\nSo I gave it 20 minutes and cupped my hand to get a good strong whiff of what was coming off my face. Indeed there is a strong floral scent. But, sadly, the urinal cake is still there in enough strength to make Lilac Vegetal unusable for future shaves. Oh well, I really gave it a good try.",

The Senator is one of my favorite pieces in my collection because I found it at an old antique store buried in one of their junk drawers, I think it was $5. Actually I found two Senator's that day but sold the other one off long ago.\n\nI was surprised by the Dr. Jon's soap with the crazy amount of lather and the rather strong scent. This was another one of my many soaps that hadn't ever seen use. I really liked the smell of this one and will be adding it to the rotation at the conclusion of the games.\n\n\nI can now say that 5 days in I have used a different soap, after shave, brush and razor each day. However, my wife is starting to ask questions about how much stuff I really have...\n\n\nWhy do the weekends go so quick?\n\n\n**JUNE CHALLENGE**\n\n\n**DAYS COMPLETED: 5/30**\n\n\n**UNIQUE SOAPS: 5**",

In any case, it's nice to be getting back to an artisan soap after brand names for a couple days. It makes you realize how lucky we are when the artisan stuff is generally better in every respect, and at a lower price.\n\nI've used a bunch of Dr. Jon's soaps, but the 1803 is a new addition for me. It smells ... *awesome*. I can't quite nail down what I'm smelling in the scent, but it's fantastic. Performance is very good, if not quite among the top tier of artisans. One nagging gripe against Dr. Jon's soaps, is that they vary spectacularly in consistency. The base is supposedly the same for all of them, yet some (Propaganda/1803) are kinda hard, and others (Classic/Anne Bonny) are soft even by cream standards.\n\nI'm going to give 1803 4.25/5. Really, it's a 4/5 soap, but with an added bonus, because every time I reach for one of these soaps, I'm struck by how goddamn awesome the artwork is. It genuinely makes me enjoy the product more.\n\n**Challenge Running Total**\n\n- 5 Themes complete\n- 5 Unique soaps used",

The only thing I have to compare this brush to is an unbranded brush I found in new condition in an antique shop a few weeks ago. That knot isn't near as dense as this Silvertip from Frank's. I have benched all other brushes so I can get more time with the badgers to break them in a little.\n\nThis soap isn't a top tier soap, but it still a pretty good performer. The Toggle is not only a nice collectors piece, it's also a pretty damn good shaver too. I use it so infrequently that I forget it was intended to be used when it was made.

Then I remembered I have this Faena stuff. Really damn good soap from Greece that reminds me of Latha the way it performs and lathers up. This is the second knot I have put in this handle and I'm still not sure. I have one on its way that I'm 100% positive I'll like the most so I used a very small amount of silicone just so I can actually use the handle. It's been sitting around for too long and needs the attention it deserves. Hopefully the Romera dude ships fast so I can get my preferred knot in here ASAP.\n\n- Shaves: **5/30**\n- Soaps: **5/30**\n- Brands: **5/30**",

From somewhere nearby you can smell hot coffee. But\nyou also also smell ... something else. Something feral, and not a little\ndemonic. You look and see crouched next to you a hound, an enormous coal-black\nhound, but not such a hound as mortal eyes have ever seen. A gust of air from\nthe doorway brings the odour of the coffee more strongly to your nose, and now\nyou can smell that it must be a thick Turkish coffee, sugar added with a rather\nheavy hand (perhaps to mask the taste of something else, because there's also\nanother component to the coffee scent that you can't quite place...)..\n\nApropos of giant hounds, [a recent news story: 7' Tall Hellhound Skeleton Unearthed Near Ancient\nBritish Monastery](https://www.bozzfeed.com/breaking-7-foot-tall-hellhound-skeleton-unearthed-near-ancient-monastery-in-uk/)\n\nI find Leviathan somehow a bit difficult to get my ideal lather. It seems to\nwant a good bit of water, but worked in very slowly.\n\nWith the leather component of Leviathan, Bvlgari Black seemed appropriate.\n\nDespite this being \"Shea Butter\" day, this shave ended up with a dark Alice-ish\ntheme to it (including the razor, with its faux tortoise-shell dyed ox-horn scales).\n\n**edit**: [link to yesterday's Lather Games SOTD](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/4mhf0a/lather_games_sotd_thread_saturday_jun_04_2016/d3vy44q)",

Passion isn't one of their more popular scents (at least in the SOTDs I've seen), but it combines two great scents that I'd like to see more of in shaving soaps: teakwood and cardamom. Great product nonetheless.",

It was at the Funny Bone, which sucks, and I watched him turn a room from ambivalent to eating out of his palm. Beautiful.

Marcus Welby, M.D. was the most popular TV show. **Music:** 1970 was a pretty sad year for music IMO. The Beatles \"Let It Be\" was the most popular song this year and was the anthem for the Beatles break-up. The world also lost Jimi Hendrix and Janis Joplin in 1970.\n\nOn to today's shave:\n\n**Pre:** Shower, Dr. Bronner's Lavender with Emu Oil\n\n**Lather:** MLS Drunken Goat\n\n**Brush:** Virginia Sheng Frankenbrush\n\n**Razor:** Black Handle SuperSpeed (P4 - 1970)\n\n**Blade:** Feather (2)\n\n**Post:** Thayer's Witch Hazel\n\n**After:** Nivea AS Balm\n\n\nMy first MLS of the challenge is also my first MLS soap. The first time I smelled the Drunken Goat, I wanted to eat it right out of the tub. I now have well over ten MLS scents and the Goat may still be my favorite. The Goat is love!\n\nI really need a cooler birth razor. The Black Handle is okay, but not even close to being in the regular rotation.\n\n\nHappy Sunday!",

Needless to say I was surprised. Further surprised when I checked the ingredient list on the rich vs. the tube, and found that the tube DOES have shea. Though I was looking forward to Cade today, I'm not touching my little sample tube except for travel. Needless to say, FCSSC was a happy replacement, and was not a maker I had scheduled for this month, which worked out great. This is a truly lovely scent, which has a nice balance of floral and vetiver. Good for a kind of rainy day in late spring with flowers blooming. I will definitely need a tub when I finally kill this sample.\n\n[Edit: Days completed: 5/30 Unique Soaps/creams: 5 Unique Aftershaves: 5 Unique soap/cream makers: 5]",

Going to be testing the ZY that I honed. The first shave with it was meh. /u/dendj55 recommended taking it back to the finisher with a slurry. I have the Wüsthof on deck as backup.\nSoap Commander is a really good soap. Still need to find a scent for me. This one is nice, but a little too sweet. Like a sweeter Latha Sandalwood.\n\nEdit: first pass with the ZY was aiight. So grabbed the Wüsthof for the second pass. Back to the drawing board. Not sure if it's at the bevel set or polishing stones where I'm just not getting the edge where I want it",

This brush is also the one that really forces me to remember to use just the tips. When light pressure is used, it's soft and scrubby at the same time, with a ton of backbone. If you use too much pressure, you get reminded quickly not to do that with a few pokes. It's also a little bit of a lather hog... I learned not to use it with any soaps I am trying to ration. Pre de Provence isn't one of them.\n\nToday's go with this 1914 (later version) is my second use of it post adjusting the springs that hold the blade in place. It's back to where it should be, an extremely efficient razor that has no trouble mowing anything in its way. I need to have a few more alternations with the 1924 to see which I like more.\n\nPost shave feels great on its own with that PdP niceness, but I am using some Kyovu Original, it's been a while since I have. On its own, I felt it would be a little heavy, so I diluted it in my palm with some plain witch hazel. It worked out great!\n\nI hope everyone is having a great weekend!",

Johnny Cash had the hit, but Kris Kristofferson wrote it.\n\nAll the software has shea in it, in most cases as a featured ingredient. Catie's Bubbles Luxury Cream Soap is an amazing soap formula, probably the best I've used, and the fern scent is really nice, with fennel on top and cedar moss replacing the usual oakmoss.\n\nThe Shea Moisture splash is a drugstore item, but is really one of the best performing, soothing splashes I've used. Really underrated.\n\nI love the Scarlatti's handle but I only just like the knot. Might eventually reknot it, or maybe I'll learn to love the knot as I keep using it.",

It was one of the first samples I got when I first started DE shaving, but I didn't know quite what to pair the scent with. First time using the Chatillon Lux GLS toner as well, really nice on my skin and good scent afterwards. Chatillon has some great smells and they pair really well with lots of soaps, looking forward to trying them all.

Derby blades were the first I used for DE shaving. I first used Aqua Velva the first time I shaved, and it was the only aftershave I used for decades. So it's old-timey stuff all around.\n\nI had to edit the shave a little, and while I was at it decided to try a Derby blade, which I haven't used in a long time. Dialed the razor back to 5 in anticipation of the worst, but it was actually remarkably good. Some day I'm going to have to do some back-to-back testing against my standard go-to, the Astra SP.\n\n6 days, 6 unique soaps (7 if I get to count both ingredients in the Superlather).",

Still, it fits the theme perfectly, and it's a classic.\n\n\nI'm always a bit surprised at how well Proraso works. It's easy to dismiss, but clearly it didn't become the most widespread shaving soap by being garbage. It's slick, protective, and feels nice. I don't like the smell, and it dries my skin out, so low marks on post shave. I wish it smelled more like the splash, which seems a little more refined to me.\n\n\nI'll give Proraso a solid 3/5. In my mind, as the ubiquitous shaving soap, it's the standard against which all other soaps get judged.\n\nEdit: Totals:\n\n**Challenge Running Total**\n\n- 6 Themes complete\n- 6 Unique soaps used",

Henckels 11/16 QH\n**Post:** Lucky Tiger - extra moisturizer\n**Frag:** Marc Jacobs\n\nI am not a particular fan of menthol and this soap is at the upper limit of my tolerance for it. I did an accounting of my soap yesterday and although I knew I was going to be short for 30 unique soaps that are on theme, I'm a lot closer than I thought. I made no attempt to prepare for the soap challenge. I hadn't even planned on participating and decided to play along on the morning the challenge started. I'm going to be 4 short. Since I didn't prepare or plan to participate, this tells me I have too damn much soap.\n\nApart from practice lathers, this is my first use of this knot. I set all three knots a bit on the high side and will probably drop them down after I see how much the knots will relax. Not being a badger guy, I have no benchmark for performance. I can say that I didn't detect much difference between this knot and the 22mm Silvertip I used yesterday. My impressions will undoubtedly change as time goes by. In any case, both brushes felt good on my face and made a metric shit ton of lather. Monday has arrived and I'm not ready for it.\n\nEdit: Added tally-\nDays completed: 6\nUnique soaps used: 6",

      "body": "**Backward with Time - Menthol Monday**\n\n**1967** The Green Bay Packers defeated the Kansas City Chiefs in what would later be called Super Bowl I. Rolling Stone magazine was published for the first time. *The Andy Griffith Show* and *The Lucy Show* battled it out for the most popular TV show of the year. **Music:** 1967 was a pivotal year for music. The Beatles released both *Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band* and *Magical Mystery Tour.* The Doors splashed on the scene with *The Doors.* The Monkees were all the rage. Somewhat surprisingly, the number one song of the year was Procol Harum's *Whiter Shade of Pale.*\n\nOn to today's shave:\n\n**Pre:** Shower, Prorazo Green Pre\n\n**Lather:** Prorazo Green\n\n**Brush:** Mühle hjm Black Fibre\n\n**Razor:** Slim Adjustable (M3 - 1967)\n\n**Blade:** Feather (3)\n\n**Post:** Thayer's Witch Hazel\n\n**After:** Suavecito Eucalyptus & Tea Tree As Balm\n\n\nThe old stand by. I started wet shaving in 2009 when I got laid off as a means to save some money. I bought a Parker razor from Amazon and a tub of Prorazo Green along with some blades. For five years, this was the only lather I used...I just didn't know what I was missing. I kind of love lathering with this on occasion; it brings back memories kind of like cracking open a Milwaukee's Best. Nostalgic of a simpler, if not better, time.\n\nHappy Monday!",

I would say Arctique is just at the threshold of the amount of cold that I can handle. It's going to come in really handy in the next few months. Took a hot shower just to test it, and it came through. The only downside is that I should've used a milder razor, given my propensity to accidentally use too much pressure when my face is numb and I can't feel the razor. Unfortunately time was of the essence and this was the only one in my bathroom. Some irritation on the neck, but not the worst price to pay for feeling ice cold on a warm morning.",

Um, OK, thanks.*\n\n+ Soap: **Leviathan**\n+ Razor: **Aristocrat #16**\n+ Brush: **Fine 20mm synthetic**\n+ Splash: **Mickey Lee Bodhisattva**\n+ Blade: **Voskhod**\n\nI shave at night. Particularly impressed with the diplomatic moxie of Ser Davos Seaworth, and remembering I must exhaust my current supply on or about September 22, Leviathan was on deck. It's my favorite soap. I can't wait to get it in the Glissant base. I'd like to try the aftershave too, so there's one reason to look forward to Fall.\n\nI had intended to use my PK-47, but forgot to soak it while brushing my teeth, so the little Fine stepped in. Some think 20mm is too small, but after having used my 24mm Maggard synthetic, I think the Fine version compares very well in terms of size & proportion.\n\nI'm a broken record when it comes to singing the praises of the #16 Aristocrat. Although I'll get back to my beloved Wolfman next week, if the Aristocrat were my only razor I'd be content.\n\nNot that it \"pairs\" well with Leviathan--and honestly, I detect no soap scent after my shaving is complete, so any \"pairing\" is only done in spirit--but I am quite fond of the Bodhisattva. My wife's initial reaction to my [over]application was, \"That smells like Off\" (the insect repellent) but once it gassed out a bit she said it smelled quite nice. I apply a double dose--one to my face and one to my neck--because if a little is good then a lot must be better, right? Also as a prophylactic against infection as I get nicks from acne.\n\nFinally, this is the first time I used a Voskhod in the Aristocrat. It was a BBS shave all around, but there seemed to be a bit more chuffing at first.\n\nHappy Monday y'all!",

The base plate is surely different but the two razors appear to shave much the same, which is quite excellently. Any differences are as likely to be from a variation in lather as to the difference in baseplate design.\n\nAnyone who doubts that a vegan soap can't match a tallow soap ought to try one of the Saponificio Varesinos and this is a guy who thought tallow was the only way to go. I have the Felce Aromatica and the Tundra Artica and both are truly excellent lathers.",

Obviously, this meant I loved menthol. The next logical step was to get a sample of CFG's Cryogen, right? It turns out, I didn't like menthol as much as I thought I did. After going through some more sample, I've concluded that I like some menthol, such as in Maggard's Orange Menthol, but not dry ice being pressed against my face. I was a bit concerned that that Arctic Wyrm was going to be closer to Cryogen vs Orange Menthol since it was a mentholated version of an existing soap (Ice Wyrm), but it was a nice happy medium which was really refreshing. The mint and rosemary smell great together and the menthol added enough cooling to know it's there, but not enough to create icicle shaped tears. Finished up with some Snake Bite. While strong, the sub zero cooling goes away a lot quicker compared to letting a super mentholated soap sit on your head and face while meticulously removing every hair from your head.\n\n**Days completed**: 2/30\n**Unique soaps**: 2",

I did a ~80:20 ratio and my face was still freezing! And I guess the menthol is really that strong, since I didn't really smell the spearmint in the cream.~~ Performance-wise, the cream is actually pretty damn good considering I bought it at a Target!\n\nMenthol brings back 2 memories, the first being tiger balm - that's all my parents used whenever I was sick. For colds, for stomach aches, for anything lol. The other was back when I marched in drum corps. On show days, the mentholated gold bond was my section's holy grail of products. Prevented chafing AND was cooling (which was especially awesome when we toured the midwest). Good times.\n\nIn retrospect, I should have gone with a scented post shave. The menthol burn is so strong, I wouldn't even be able to tell if the toner itself was giving me a reaction. I will visit this one again tomorrow. Also, I really need a name for [this brush](http://imgur.com/a/irPAs) since I'm so tired of typing 39 characters whenever I shave with this. Any suggestions?\n____________________________\n**Days Completed:** 6/30\n**Unique Soaps Used:** 6",

So in what seems to be my sample modus operandi, I thought I completely overloaded my brush. I suppose I do that because I dislike re-loading, like *really* dislike it. Anyway, this cream doesn't ever really blow up, it expands, but not that much. My 'overload' was just enough for three passes...turns out I didn't overload at all.\n\nAfter the last 4 shaves with a few different new to me SE razors, I figured it was time to touch home base again with my Wolfman. I know exactly what to expect and how to maneuver it to get there.\n\nArctique is strong. Very strong. In fact, every time I use it I get at least a little in my eyes, not from actually getting it my eyes, but from the evaporation. Even today knowing full well this was going to happen, and exercising caution with quantity, I still got it in my eyes. When my eyes water from it, it gets even stronger. I kinda like it =P\n\nExtra menthol crystals in the pic because it's Menthol Monday!\n\nGreat shave, nice and cool! Happy Monday!!!",

Against the snow, black cuts on a white, white hand.\n\n-John Gardner, *Grendel*\n\nThe Shave:\n\n- Prep: Stirling mentholated preshave soap, hot towel\n- Brush: Carnavis & Richardson Chubby-style steel handle with 24mm Envy White knot (*Needs a nickname!*)\n- Soap: Krampert's Frostbite\n- Razor: Merkur 37C\n- Blade: Rockwell\n- Aftershave splash: Krampert's Frostbite\n\nWith menthol, I really like mentholated aftershaves, but I don't get into metholated soaps that much. I absolutely love Krampert's Frostbite splash, for example, but only just picked the soap recently. This was my first shave with the soap.\n\nIf you aren't familiar with Frostbite, here's the deal with it: it precedes the current crop of hypermentholated products. The current arc, as far as I can tell, starts wtih Yeti Snot, which was really cold but not really very good. Then Stirling came out with their Glacial line. The Glacial formula went through several iterations, and in the beginning it was also very cold but a pain to lather. Then Fine Snake Bite, aftershave only. Then Cryogen and Arctique, along with the now perfected Glacial line, all three available in both soap and aftershave form. But before all those, and standing aside from them, is Krampert's Frostbite. It's all about cold, but it's not about being the coldest, and it is far from being the coldest. But it's plenty cold, and the combination of cold menthol and tons of frankincense give it this lost-in-a-sinister-dark-winter-forest feel.\n\nThe best description of Krampert's Frostbite, of the smell and the experience of it, is that quote from *Grendel* above: \"Snowlight blinds me, heatless fire, pale, apocalyptic. ... The trees are dead, and only the deepest religion can break through time and believe they'll revive. Against the snow, black cuts on a white, white hand.\" And when you lather on for the third pass and you question what you're doing, like Frost says, \"the best way out is always through.\" By the time you rinse your face with cold water and then splash on the aftershave, you have been through an ordeal you will not forget. But I mean, in the summertime that feels pretty good. :)\n\n---\n\nOn to the brush: I've been nicknaming my brushes. First it was the GDSOC: a Semogue SOC boar knot deep-set in a handle by /u/thegoddamntrain. My Omega 31025 is already nicknamed Scarlatti by Omega and I'm happy calling it that. My Chubby 2 Super, which I bought from /u/uncle_dubya, I call Dubya's Chubby. And my Kent BK8 I've been calling The Fluffy Bunny. I really like the C&R/Envy White brush I used for this shave, but I can't keep calling it \"Carnavis & Richardson Chubby-style steel handle with 24mm Envy White knot.\" Any suggestions for a nickname for this brush?\n\n---\n\nRockwell blades... enh, they prove at least that not all Swedish steel blades are the same. Quite different from my beloved Rapira Super Swedes, which work great in every DE razor I have. The Rockwell blades I have yet to find the ideal razor for.",

Confirmed. Cryogen *is* mostly a sick joke. I always suspected as much, but I'd never actually tried shaving with it until now.\n\n\nI bought my Cryogen sample at least six months ago, smelled it, laughed about it, and abandoned it until today. When I opened it, I was met with the beautiful twinkling sight of [thousands of tiny spears of cold evil](http://imgur.com/ux5v5BW) that had managed to claw their way free of the soap base. This was the point at which I should have smartened up, shaved with Proraso Green, and added another separate soap manufacturer to my list. But no, this guy wanted to *really* hit the theme.\n\n\nWell, everyone says Cryogen makes your eyes water. They're right, but they're not man enough to admit that it makes your eyes water to the point of streaming down your face. Oh yea, Cryogen made me cry a little, and I still went back for a second pass.\n\n\nAnd then, with great courage, I pulled out the Summer Storm *mentholated* aftershave and suffered a bit more. And used the unscented salve on my poor, frostbitten neck.\n\n\nDays completed: **6/30**\n\nUnique soaps: **6**",

What amazing stuff.\n\nThe razor did very well this morning. I already like it better than my stainless steel Mongoose. I used a Kai blade which did much better for me than the possibly dull Feather blade on Saturday. I need to experiment with blades, but it got me BBS on a 3 pass with no irritation. It seems to like a shallow angle with the head pretty close to the face.\n\nOne design tweak I would definitely make is the posts holding the blade are SHORT. It barely holds the blade during assembly, so for those with shaky hands or poor coordination, I could see the blade falling off and causing frustration.\n\nThe bamboo handle is nice and we'll done, but I prefer the Kronos. I swapped it out after the first shave. The bamboo is probably better suited to a lighter razor that is well balanced. The ATT SE is noticeably front heavy.",

All the stuff that we avoid Roam for. But today it worked out-I have a meeting that I'm not really in the mood to go to, I have a plan of making myself a nice steak dinner tonight, and everything just screams Roam.\n\nAt first this soap and particularly the Koyvu didn't appeal to me. It seemed too metallic, too much like (as I've heard it described) soy sauce. But much like many of B&M's more complex scents it grew on me and grew on me and now I find myself looking forward to using it as a special treat. Even the Koyvu-which I think everyone agrees is incredibly strong-feels like making a statement. It's brash, it's bold, and it lingers. You either have to love it or hate it, and I find myself loving it.\n\nMy lather felt particularly good today as well. I've been trying to use less water, as the lather is feeling thin particularly in the 3rd pass. I'm trying to me more conscious of that when I'm working on building the lather on my face in the beginning to try to give more protection, since I've been having some irritation issues lately.\n\nHave a wonderful day, wet shavers!",

Frozen Tundra! Ice cold and earthy. Good stuff on a humid Monday morning. Wilkinson Sword blade is still going strong, but can I make it last 30 days? Only time will tell.\n\n**Days complete: 6/30**\n\n**Unique Soaps used: 6**\n\nEdit: I ended up using Fine Snakebite as an Aftershave to really keep with the theme. Everytime I use Snakebite I always try to figure out the scent but can never quite place it. Some say it has no scent but I think it definitely has a scent or maybe it's just the native scent of the menthol I am smelling.",

WOW what an experience, I was expecting something really harsh that would make me tear up etc. What I got in reality was this awesome chilly shave, it was the perfect amount of soothing cold. Seriously this was the most awesome shaving experience that I have ever had. I think I might be a menthol head!\n\nThe V3a did a great job too, it cut well and was easy enough to dial in. I had some irritation before shaving because I got greedy chasing bbs with the previous shave.\n\nMenthol monday was life changing, after the lather games are over I am grabbing some B&M Arctique + Splash and a tub of Cryogen + pre shave gel.\n\nHappy shaving gents!",

SO instead of the Cryogen I busted out another Stirling Glacial in \"Iced Pineapple\" it is a supremely sweet scent of gourmandy Pineapple ickiness. Reminds me of Mexican pineapple candy...

Still getting used to my SOC. I had some problems before but it would appear it was due to me not \"loading it like I hated it.\" I have all of these great scents and some of them cannot be replaced so I was probably being a bit stingy. Now the A/S is something. When I use Mr. Fine I get this lovely sting, followed by a lovely cold feeling and what I can only guess is either Menthol or Alcohol sensation in my eyes. I like it. I used this and at first it feels fine and then BURN! So something in the A/S doesn't work for me.\n\n\nJune Challenge\nDays Completed: 4\nUnique Soaps: 4",

I tend to ignore it for shaving because it tends to dry out my skin. Still, it makes a pretty decent lather and I got a pretty decent shave with it. A bit more moisturizer than I normally use and I'm good to go.\n\nThis is the first live use for this knot. Damn, it holds a bunch. It's way bigger than what I'm used to.

Morley & Sons \"Clover Brand\" 5/8\n* **Brush:** Shavemac 23mm silvertip\n* **Soap:** Haslinger Sandelholz\n* **Post:** Barclay Crocker sandalwood & juniper balm\n\nThis was a test shave with an Ebay beater that I bought so that a friend who had expressed interest in straights could try one out. The scales had a crack near the non-pivot pin and I'll eventually replace them, but I was able to repair the crack with CA glue and the blade centered fine and had good tension at the pivot pin so I decided to just get it shaving. The blade itself was in pretty good shape, and only needed some Flitz to knock off some minor rust spots.\n\nI sharpied the spine and edge and cut a fresh bevel with a DMT D8F - the resulting wear pattern was pretty even without putting too much fancy english on the honing stroke. I then went to a fast LV coticule and progressed from thick heavy slurry to something a little thicker than what I'd call misty. I then finished on a Nakayama asagi jnat on tomo slurry, going from a milky consistency to misty. At the end, it treetopped pretty well before stropping.\n\nThe test shave went well, although I may want to tone the edge down just a tick before sterilizing it and giving it to my friend. When stropping and shaving, I noticed that the length of the cutting edge on this razor is a little longer than basically all my other razors - probably 3\" compared to a more typical 2.75\" or so. Didn't make a big difference in maneuvering it around my face, but curious nonetheless. I should also note that the jimping that Morley did was really comfy.",

Sadly, JFK was assassinated this year. *The Beverley Hillbillies* was the most popular TV show of the year. **Music:** The number one song of the year was the Beatles *She Loves You.* In addition to losing JFK, the world also lost Patsy Cline.\n\nOn to today's shave:\n\n**Pre:** Shower, MLS Sandalwood Pre\n\n**Lather:** Williams Mug\n\n**Brush:** Plisson\n\n**Razor:** Lady Gillette (I1 - 1963)\n\n**Blade:** Gillette Platinum Plus (1)\n\n**Post:** Thayer's Witch Hazel\n\n**After:** Pacific Shaving Co. Caffeinated AS Balm\n\nWilliams Mug Shave Soap is...well it is. And it has **tallow.** I've made a couple sacrifices so far in order to maximize the number of unique brands I use this month. This morning was one of those sacrifices. I was planning on MLS Unforgiven, but decided that since I've already used one MLS soap (and will use one more on Sammy Lee Saturday) that I wanted to stay more pure in terms of brands. Williams is probably the stuff my grandfather used in his youth and I know men have used it for decades, but it doesn't compare to the modern artisan soaps. Oh well, as I said it does have tallow.\n\nThe Lady Gillette is very sentimental to me as it was my first vintage razor. When I got it, I didn't know the difference between a Gem and a Gillette, a TTO and 3 piece. I was clueless. But I was at an antique store and saw this beautiful vintage razor for $12. I couldn't resist.\n\nHappy Tuesday!",

Tabac Tuesdays always feel like i can grab life by the short hairs and make the day mine. I figured if there was any day to quit. I would be today. I had a great shave. At First i was torn over the 102 and wasn't an huge fan. I restarted some blade exploration and i can tell you this thing is a gentle giant. I threw a random blade in there i though was going to be garbage. but it actually performed well.\n\nO well... Back to my cube to chew through my finger nails.\n\nCheers boys,",

I've actually never tried a mentholated product before, so I guess I've got one year to get one into my rotation. For today, I went Stirling for its tallow content. I have mixed feelings about Stirling. I love the scent of Ozark Mountain, enough so that I bought the splash as well, but I find that I always have to work very hard to get a lather out of the soap, and it's never quite as protecting as I'd like. I know many people are big fans, but the base just doesn't quite perform for me.",

Sure, you're not supposed to use a new soap and razor for the same shave, but I did. It seemed like the S1, which I picked up from /u/ubaldjr, was about the smoothest operator this side of Sade. Efficiency-wise it doesn't hold a candle to the H2, but it's an alright tradeoff for me. I'd imagine that it'll end up being around 65/35 on the S1/H2 usage. Poor R2 plate probably is on its way out of the rotation.\n\nAlso, I got this Mornington soap from /u/Avastz, who went above and beyond for me, and have been looking for a chance to use it. It was slick, although maybe not so much residually, and had a pretty nice post-shave feel. The scent seemed made to pair with Pitralon Classic. A nice, old-fashioned scent and pretty good performer.\n\nAnd lastly, I think someone may have given me this Penhaligon decant, either that or I picked it up and forgot about it. I was cleaning up the workspace last night and found it behind some shelves. Damn if I don't love it. The EdP gives it staying power other Penhaligon scents don't have, plus it's like a spicy cousin to L'Occitan, but also somehow more round. Really amazing smells going on here.",

This version feels slightly more aggressive than the 'curved top' version I used a few weeks ago. Just a touch more blade feel. Whenever I feel the blade, I proceed with caution. The end result is exactly what I was looking for, a DFS with no irritation. Nuff said.\n\nStrop Shoppe is a brand I like the performance of, but the scents were always so mellow, I sort of grazed over them most of the time. Luckily I have an almost full tub of Baker Street, such a great performer.\n\nFor my post I put a little London Barbershop, and a little witch hazel together in my palm. I always feel like there's something coating my face when I use Lb on its own, like a film or coating. I discovered that if I dilute it with plain witch hazel it minimizes this, so I get a great face feel and that great scent. You can't beat that with a stick!\n\nHave a good'n!",

I have been neglecting my Ever-Ready. I had a bad experience with it the last time I used it. Maybe my angle was off, anyway, it was just as I remembered, smooth and effortless.\n\nNow, the great thing about barbershop scent is you can pair this up with anything. I have quite a few A/S samples in my den so I just chose one at random. Barnacle Bob is reminiscent of the coast being salty, with green notes. It was rather pleasant.\n\nHave a great tuesday guys!",

      "body": "[Tallow Tuesday](https://imgur.com/lrosq4j)\n\n* Pre: shower with glycerin face soap\n* Lather: Soapy Bathman Black Magic\n* Brush: Semogue 620\n* Razor: Delta Echo Desert Brown Fatboy\n* Blade: Gillette SB\n* Post: witch hazel followed by Nivea Sensitive ASB\n\nSoapy Bathman Black Magic was a gift from my wife when I got into WS. With very little reviews at the time I had to evaluate this artisan soap completely on my own. The scent from the description is as follows:\n\n\"Hints of sandalwood, cedarwood, lemon and bergamot dancing with ylang-ylang, lavender, rose. Then allowing warm amber,coriander, patchouli, and spicy vanilla to cut in before the night is over.\"\n\nI'm not too terribly good at describing scents and when there's a number of notes coming together it's even harder for me to differentiate them. Off the bat the scent is slightly sweet, I mean a very tiny hint, not anything that could even be considered sickly and quite light overall even though mentally you're thinking it'll be in the same family as B&M Baudelaire, WK Vetivertal; \"heavy\" if you will. I would say it's between a bright scent like CdA and a warm/heavy scent like Beau, not saying it's a combination of the two, just overall atmosphere.\n\nWith that said it took a bit for me to warm up to the scent but the performance however was apparent from the first shave. It is exactly what a wet shaver looks for in a soap, as every box is checked off from cushion, slickness, protection, and post shave feel. As I collected more artisan soaps SB BM continued to be a soap I would use if I needed a protective shave, it was just too easy to get a great shave.\n\n**Shave: 7 of 30**\n**Diff soaps used: 7**",

I told u/Eighchops I liked the simpsons classic 1 handle so he set out to make the world's tiniest brush handle in stainless steel. (I'm pretty sure Guinness world records has comfirmed) this thing is perfect. The shape is so comfortable in my hand and has an ideal weight to it. Beautiful craftsmanship. (I will he ordering more from him) the envy white knot is soft but not too floppy. This little brush is great for face lathering. Thank you so much (again) for making me such a great brush. Also night music. I mean night music you know. Great shave today. Have a wonderful Tuesday shavers.",

This soap performs pretty well, though I did get some irritation on my upper lip, I guess it's time to change blades. Too bad they closed shop before I even started wet shaving :/\n\nAs far as the toner goes.. There didn't seem to be any burning from the toner at all, even though I did have irritation on my lip. /u/hawns I'm starting to think I'm either allergic to some scent oils, or /u/garewolf did something to those toner samples he sent me >:/ I'll likely use the Y/R/P or whatever old toner I have leftover as a somewhat positive control.\n\nI rented a Rug Doctor yesterday and cleaned the carpet while my mom was on vacation as a late mother's day gift (her birthday is next week, so I need to figure something else out quick.. Maybe trekking poles for hiking) and I'm not looking forward to moving the furniture back. I have to return the thing before I leave for San Francisco soon too.

Granted today is about as close to a freebie as we get in the challenge when your collection consists of mostly tallow soaps.

I feel like this fougere scent works well on a rainy day as well so it's a coincidence I just got back from being out in the rain.\n\nI'm also very happy with this homemade aftershave - works better than the other balms I own. I wanted to make a balm but this ended up as...a salve. Very liquidy and it looks slightly oily but it dries fast and leaves my skin feeling hydrated and smooth. I got the recipe off of B&B and tweaked it to my preference. If anybody would like I can share it here.\n\nAlso I just realized this is my first SOTD post on the new sub. Cheers!",

Shambala & Dapper Dragon Scale Polish\n\nToday marks my 6th straight razor shave and my 7th entry into the lather games! I went for two full passes without using any other razor which I gotta say was pretty cool. I felt my blade tugging a ton and I didn't really cut much hair, yet I have irritation on my face. My lather was fine too, I dunno what gives there. I decided to bust out the Cr0x and see about using that a little before shaving next. It's possible my bad stropping has dulled the blade faster.\n\nThe Semogue was terrific, this thing is not quite broken in but if how it performs now is to be an indicator of things to come, then I will be enjoying this for a long time.",

I bought the stick many months ago and, like Cryogen, smelled it and then never actually got around to using it.\n\nThis seemed like the day for it. It's about the cheapest tallow soap you can get, no frills, just animal day and whatever they use to scent urinal cakes.\n\nWell, I officially don't care for the stick format, as I greatly prefer bowl lathering. It's hard to get uniform consistency especially with the stick. The water just doesn't blend in the way I want to.\n\nSo, the first pass was thick but good, and then I got halfway through my second pass, i.e. I did my cheeks and jaw no problem, but had to take the brush to the bowl before I could do my neck, as the lather was just too dry and thick. It is *definitely* true though, what they say about Arko exploding with lather. That was fun.\n\nAlso, good god, that post shave. So dry. Not worth it. I had intended to revisit my old Lucky Tiger balm, but I needed something really moisturizing, so the trust Chatillon Lux salve it was.\n\nDays completed: **7/30**\n\nUnique soaps: **7**",

I really like it, it reminds me a little bit of Razorock Mudder Focker, just a little bit. I might go for a full tub of this in my next Maggards order. The Proraso Aftershave cream is nice, makes my face super soft and it's unscented for if you use a strong scented soap you want to let linger.\n\n**Days complete: 7/30**\n\n**Unique Soaps used: 7**",

(It took 9 calendar days to arrive.) Shipping cost determined the number of soaps I bought, and of the 4 Tierra Humeda was up first. Lather is wicked good. Reminded me of Bufflehead. Just really creamy. Scent is stronger than most. The strongest scent I pulled from Tierra Humeda (\"wet earth\") was that of cedar. It's a bit early to tell, but based on this first my top tier soaps are going to have to make room for a new neighbor. I'm looking forward to using the other soaps (Brisa de Oriente, Rosa Bourbon & Haitian Vetiver). Manuel also included 5 (**five!**) samples, so it's going to be a fun couple of weeks. :-)\n\nBecause of the cedar note, I opted for some La Quatrième Ville. Now, the last time I used this splash a couple of weepers appeared after I wrapped things up. So I applied the styptic, rinsed and then put on more LQV in the affected area. As luck would have it, that night included a little [business time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqZcYPEszN8) and this double dose proved to be too much for a certain participant. I tried to \"sneak\" it on last night to see if she'd notice, but was immediately found out. Unfortunately, she's now soured on the LQV, so it'll be looking for a new home during my next den purge. (*sad*) Let that be a lesson to you night shaving Don Juans--don't double dose the splash if you want to keep the lady happy.\n\nAnyway, American Blend pinch hit without much fanfare and led to some Rive Gauche for today.\n\nHappy Wednesday y'all!",

I was surprised. Its very slick and it shaves well. Near BBS or more and no apparent irritation. Fragrance? What are these guys complaining about? Its no more an issue than my Palmolive shave stick fragrance. Both are mild and citrusy. I am just fine with both. With this razor which has very little clearance for lather and whiskers to move through it seemed to drag a bit at times. I attributed that to it being a bit in need of water but adding water didn't seem to solve it. Still, an excellent shave.\n\nHow about drying effect on my skin? Some sign of that but with Lucky Tiger and then a L'Occitane balm that disappeared quickly. Is it due to insufficient water or chemicals in the soap? I have no idea but I'll guess its the latter. Do I have better soaps? Sure. Would Arko be just fine to use regularly? I think so. Would I love it? I don't think so. Will it replace any of my travel shave sticks that I can choose from? Let's see, Speick, Palmolive, La Toja, Tabac and Valobra? No, it won't. Valobra will be in my kit when I travel again. I mean, why not? A small 50 gm stick and a tremendous shave soap. I took a whiff a couple of days ago and it is not scentless as advertised. Maybe the Fougere, probably the Cologne and I like it a lot!\n\nThe RRSS continues to impress me. To think that I had it sitting in a drawer for 18 months. This is a very good razor on a daily shaving basis. I tend to think with multiple days of growth I would strongly prefer my Techs or NEW SC or I can wheel out my venerable 37C. I have easily shaved 4 days of growth with my Pre-War Tech and this isn't an easy beard to shave. Old guy's dry, white no particular grain pattern. The Tech did it without any problem; the NEW SC just scoffed at the test.:-)",

I'm expecting my DER Tech to come back soon and my friend should be sending his Gillette Diplomat soon too. I'll be home tomorrow night. Friday's shave will be glorious.

I usually don't DE--it's just SE and Injectors for me--but I always try again. In part this is because I really love some of my DEs. In particular, my Ball End Tech may be the prettiest razor I own. It's in near flawless condition. The balance is perfect. It feels great in my hand.\n\nBut...but, I just can't get a good shave from DEs. Ended up having to go 4 passes. One part of my face is bleeding, the other one still has stubble, and my chin has irritation. It's frustrating because, as instruments, I really love the DEs. But they just don't do it for me shave-wise, and that's a big disappointment.\n\nI have to go in to work today (I mostly work from home in the summer) so I couldn't Roam it up, despite declaring it as my Summer Seasonal yesterday. LPC is perfect, though, for a light, attractive smelling soap. I wish it would become a permanent part of the Latha line. The AS in particular is my favorite non-alcohol based splash. The slight hint of menthol is perfect at the end. Both soap and splash are just designed so darn well.\n\nHave a great day!",

Burned my dominant hand badly and had to wait for it to heal up. Luckily just in time, my most recent Maggard order came in so I tried the V3A. Wow, so efficient and comfortable!\n\nShout outs to MLS for their Grand Havana pomade, I keep catching whiffs of it; it's great!\nhttp://i.imgur.com/O49p5bY.jpg",

Such a fantastic scent. Is it just me or does anyone else get a chocolate scent off the puck after use? I decided to grab a blade from ny sampler pack I only have a few left and I want to get them out of the way.\n\nCroma blades are nice. They're pretty damn sharp I had to really be careful with the pressure. Im gonna keep it for a few more shaves and see how I like it.\n\nHave a great Thursday guys!",

The shave was incredible. Standard level incredible. I'll be using this for a while and see how it performs in the long run.\n\nAll my boar brushes have been shedding lately. Including todays 1305. Dunno why. I generally use them carefully without any vigorous motions. Maybe I'm not letting them dry enough? I shake off all excess water and run circular motions on a towel before keeping on my desk to dry.\n",

I was told by a fellow shaver here (I think it was the /u/Huckleberryking) that using this soap is like being punched in the face by Mike Tyson holding a fist full of vetiver. I'd say that description is apt. Eufros soaps seem to be more heavily scented than most and this version isn't the sweet, friendly, light grassy vetiver you might know from, for example, Fine's Green Vetiver. No, this is more like jumping face down in a muddy field of vetiver as [Papa Doc's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fran%C3%A7ois_Duvalier) hunt you down. It is raw and visceral, not at all like a perfume. Do I like it? To paraphrase a great line: This isn't a PG-13 soap, it's a rated R soap, a soap I'm not sure whether or not I like yet.\n\nToo melodramatic?\n\nScent aside, the performance is really good. I used Tierra Humeda yesterday, which is from the regular (non-premium) line and the closest thing that compares to is Bufflehead. I've only used each soap once, but I'd say the premium line was even a bit more slick. This is really good stuff. I'm looking forward to the other 2 soaps and 5 samples waiting in the wings.",

Its been hot the last few weeks in Michigan, so the break in the heat and the cool that came with gave me the opportunity to use the Lavanille. That beautiful, inky, leathery, dark mistress.

I had to decide what to go with this afternoon and decided, well, fuck it, I'm going to go DE again, just to compare. Used a different one this time, my NEW LC with a Feather instead of an Astra (Astras generally work well for me).\n\nI had a great shave overall. Sadly I got some irritation on my upper lip and chin area, but it was nowhere near as bad as yesterday. While that part of the shave left something to be desired, the rest of it was actually really excellent. BBS with a really nice post-feel. No wonder the NEW LC is my favorite DE.\n\nI also decided to go the balm then splash route today because I once read somewhere on here that was a good idea. I don't know why, and don't know if it's true, but, hell, why not try. Certainly didn't hurt, and as I said I have a real nice post-shave feel right now so maybe that had something to do with it.\n\nThis shave gave me an opportunity to reflect on how this summer I seem to be doing a lot more experimentation with my shaving. This is my first summer as a wetshaving enthusiast. Last year at this time I owned two razors, one brush, and one soap. Now, well, let's just say I own more.\n\nI'm fortunate that I work from home for about 90% of the summer. During the rest of the year my shaves have to be quick and efficient, so I generally use the same soap and razor every day to get a clean and irritation free shave. I like the fact that I can try things out more this summer, mess around with my DEs, all that stuff. I feel like it's opening me to a lot more opportunities shave-wise and it's making me enjoy the hobby more.\n\nEnjoy the rest of your day!",

I received 4 tins of Eufros this week and was going to use that anyway, so really I just had to find something else made in Spain. (I know, pretty weak.)\n\nThe Eufros continues to impress. The Brisa de Oriente (Oriental Breeze) has some spice to it. It's not the incense-type scent I was expecting, but rather more of a cinnamon/clove/ginger-ish tea aroma.\n\nThis stuff lathers great. I've been using my light weight Fine on it, rather than my Paladin, so's not to pick up too much soap. Additionally, I reduced the number of load swirls from 50 to 40, and even my little 20mm synthetic was able to grab enough for a 3 pass shave.\n\nMy *yuge* bottle of Floid Blue--made even more unwieldy by the bulbous atomizer--sits in the back of the closet, so I don't reach for it much. The scent is a nice clean powder and the face feel is pleasant, but IMO performance is not on pace with the hype. Applying aftershave with an atomizer might earn you some strange looks from your wife, but it's a great way to efficiently apply the stuff. Much less goes wasted than dumping it in your hand and then splashing it on your face. Plus, for a brief moment you can imagine you're Thurston Howell the Third.\n\nTGIF y'all!",

While the razor has a bite to it, I didn't get any nicks or irritation this time. I chose the Jermyn St. as I feel it gives excellent protection. I was only going to use alum as my post but a friend showed up and offered me a lotion to try. Wish I could remember the name but it had a light, green tea, oatmeal scent. A lady friend bought me the Capricorn Astrological oil. She said it made me smell like a witch. It's kind of a floral, patchouli, sandalwood scent. She bought it at the Magick Cauldron here in Houston. Their website says: \"These oils are for Magickal Ritual use only! Not intended for internal consumption. They can be used for anointing of candles, the bath or wearing.\" The scent paired well with the Jermyn St. and lasted a long time. I could still detect the fragrance on my clothes several days later. Going to a southwest Texas country party this weekend. Going to roast some kielbasas over an open flame and drink some beer.\n\nSeize the weekend ya'll!",

Probably the best I've had in a few weeks. First time trying P&B and let me tell you guys that the hype is real! Slickest soap I have ever used right next to Barrister & Mann, and the scent? Oh man, Im a citrus nut and I love this scent, it's very citrus-y but not overwhelming, it's sweet, and bright, absolutely loved it. These guys are going to be a permanent product in my den!\n\n4711 is probably my favorite citrus splash right now, it complimented Citra Royale beautifully. I just wish the scent lasted longer. Oh well, great shave over all.\n\nHave a great Friday guys! \\ ^ - ^ /",

It's ok though the dfs covers it up and that's all I smell. I love me some dfs. Enjoy your weekend everybody. I have to work this weekend but I'm hoping they are short days.",

When I opened it today the soap appeared very oily and shiny. 1803 is far softer than my tin of Aphrodite which made loading a little more tricky than I am accustomed to. The scent of 1803 is very pleasant, thankfully. I may shoot an email to Dr. Jon and ask their advice on what appears to be separation of ingredients. There's probably nothing to be done for it, but it never hurts to ask.",

Very happy with my latest MLS purchase.\n\nHave a question for you fellow shavers. So, my tub of Lavanille is almost up. I also have the Lavanille splash and Night Music splash as well. Right now, for summer time, my small (I limit myself to 6 soaps at most) collection of soaps is mostly citrus and floral. So after using one of those soaps, Lavanille or Night Music isn't exactly what I grab first. So I was hoping some of you guys would have some recommendations as to a soap I could buy that will work well for a nice summer scent, while still being able to pair nicely with the two aforementioned splashes. I plan on buying Lavanille again later in the year so this soap is more for summer, early fall. I have taken a look at Sapone Di Paolo Cremoso which is creamy scent made of Coconut and Vanilla. I'm no scent master though so any opinions and recommendations will be appreciated. Thanks in advance!",

I'll give a better review of it after some more use.",

While the performance of Santa Paula is top notch, as with all CFG soaps, I'm just not sure on the scent. It seems to be loaded with orange peel. To me, anyway. It's very cirtrusy, but also kinda bitter. Maybe if I had ever visited a California orange grove the scent might be more familiar and thus more positive. The scent is definitely not bad or unpleasant, it just may not be for me.\n\nIn any case, following up with Easy St. splash was the right choice. What a shame Easy St. is no longer produced. I have found Easy St. splash to be one of my favorites and I try to ration its use as best I can.\n\nAnd thank heavens the on-base beer shop got something new and different in stock. They got cases and cases of Rogue 7 Hop IPA and 4 Hop IPA. The 4 Hop IPA is fantastic and I look forward to trying the 7 Hop IPA. They're $6 for a pint bottle, so I can't buy too many.",

I could tell from the first stroke it was going to be an excellent shave. First time using the 7 O'Clock black box, and they've becoming my favourite blade so far. No tugging, and absolutely no neck irritation. I also used cold water today. This was also the closest neck shave with only two passes. Jawline still needs a bit of touch up, but I'm not complaining. It's nice to finally find one of those blades that works well for me.\n\nEnjoy your shave!",

The best price, oddly enough, seems to come from [Connaught Shaving](http://connaughtshaving.com). I say oddly enough because I live in the US and Connaught is in England, but even after shipping and exchange rate it ended up cheaper, so, whatever. As I wait and wait and wait for the blades to get here, I've decided to do some SE blade exploration before settling forever with the PTFE.\n\nAs I mentioned, my shave yesterday with the PAL Blue Carbon Steel blades was horrible. Today's shave with GEM Carbon Steel blades was not horrible (I didn't have to change the blades during my first pass like I did yesterday), but it wasn't great. Despite the ER 1914 being a wonderfully efficient razor, it took me 4 passes to get a shave I was happy with. I ended up with a good deal of irritation--and it almost felt like, at points, the blade wasn't cutting but pulling. It won't be a blade that I'll use again.\n\nIn other shaving thoughts, I truly love pairing Tabac with the B&M Barrister's Reserve Beta. For some reason this scent combination works well for me. I find the scent pleasant and light, and I'm looking forward to the official release of Barrister's Reserve soon.\n\nHave a wonderful evening, all!\n\nEDIT: Title.",

Having only known one head design, getting good shaves is coming slow but steady with the Rockwell. They are improving each day.",

This would have qualified for today's lather games but I don't have the discipline to do this. BBS shave again with the new Wolfman. I have both an OC and SB head and so far (only 1 shave with each) I'd give a slight advantage to the SB. All things being equal my face always slightly disagrees with an OC. Suspect it is technique and experience (or lack thereof) not kicking in. Happy Tuesday everyone!",

      "body": "* **Razor:** JE Henckels \"Friodur 472\" 13/16\n* **Brush:** Shavemac 23mm 3-band silvertip\n* **Soap:** Tabac\n* **Post:** Speick splash\n\nMy first shave with the 472. It went really, really well. Something about the size, the bellied grind and the honing really agrees with my face - I was between BBS and DFS after two passes, and there wasn't any alcohol sting when I put on the aftershave. I should also note that the jimping on this razor feels really good in my hand, even though it isn't the prettiest.\n\nBackground: a few weeks ago, I bought a pair of NOS Friodurs from an Ebay seller - a 72 and a 472. I finally got around to honing and shaving with them, the 72 two days ago and the 472 today. Part of the delay was that I'm a lazy SOB, but mostly it was because I hadn't set a bevel on a razor that had never been honed before (these both had no honewear, no bevel and didn't shave arm hair as they came out of the box). So in the meantime I bought a couple of Ebay beaters and tested my progression on them - DMT D8F to a dilucot progression on the faster of my cotis before finishing on a jnat. I think I've talked about those beater razors (a Torrey and a Morley) in earlier SOTDs - they shave well now and I'll probably loan them to a friend who wants to try straights.\n\nI was pleased with the results on the cheap razors, so I honed the 72 first, finishing on a very hard 8x2\" Shobudani asagi with tomo slurry, starting out thick and finishing on a sort of mist. The results were good but not great - the resulting edge was in the coticule++ zone. I also noticed that I had scuffed the part of the spine just above the honewear when doing the bevel work on the diamond plate. This wasn't an issue with the 72 (it has a plain spine so I can just polish the scuffs out), but it would be with the 472's decorated spine.\n\nAs a result, I used a different progression with the 472, skipping the D8F and setting the bevel on the coti. It didn't take as long as I expected - I was shaving arm hair easily after about fifteen minutes. I finished on a Takashima iromono koppa that is a little bit softer than my other Jnats but still probably in the \"hard\" class. I made slurry with a Nakayama asagi tomo nagura, and after I figured I had refined the edge as much as I was going to with tomo slurry I finished on plain water, going until I felt stickiness and could see undercut along the entire edge. The result was very keen and super smooth and I'm really, really pleased with it.\n\nSpecial thanks this week to /u/runninscared for pointing out AFrames Tokyo to me (where I got the Takashima, the tomo I used with it, and another tomo that I haven't experimented with yet) and to /u/Old_Hiker to whom I promised pictures of the Friodurs. Still working on those pictures - I've got my lightbox set up but my youngest (4 mos) has his crib in the same room where I'd be taking the pictures and he doesn't sleep well when it isn't really dark (even with a sheet over the crib), so I'm pretty much limited to Saturdays.",

This is the combination I landed on after about 15 minutes of internal deliberation. I don't have the deepest bench of shave products in the world, but that didn't make the decision any easier :)\n\nDisclaimer: This is not to be confused with a \"deserted island\" shave, which would be SMdF soap and aftershave all the way!\n\nHappy shaving, friends!!\n",

I even had a little trouble with my lather at first. I think I got used to my nicer soaps and loaded it like the others, but when I lathered it it was too airy. I tried again and it was better. Also, this is my first time using this soap at my new place so the water may be a bit different than what I'm used to. That being said, I still managed to get a nice shave without any nicks or irritation.",

I had some Proraso green, though, that I haven't used in forever, and it fit today's theme, so I thought I'd use it as a show of solidarity for all the participants. I may do it again on Thursday because vetiver.\n\nI see a lot of upturned noses around here whenever Proraso is mentioned, and I really don't understand why unless it's simple snobbery. It's actually a really good soap/cream, and a certifiable classic. I feel like people who say it doesn't perform well aren't lathering it correctly, which is weird to me because it's ridiculously easy to dial in.\n\nBut, I digress. [M-m-m-my Kuh-rona](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2dicpOe4HE) breezed its way through my stubble this morning. No irritation whatsoever. The GSB is performing admirably in it so far. Proraso is somewhat lacking in the post-shave department, but Dapper Dragon's Scale Polish more than makes up for that. *Green Dragon* and Proraso Green also pair really well. All in all a great shave.\n\nHappy Tuesday, everyone!",

No nicks or irritation. Only felt the need for alum in post. It seems like my stropping is a bit more on point this time as well. Performance and scent of Bespoke #1 is outstanding. Keep doing what you do LASSC! I'll pick up another full tub when I whittle my stash down a bit. Was going to go with a different fragrance but I was hanging with the friend who gave me the Astrological Oil. They wanted to smell it on me ; )\n\nWe're half way there ya'll",

I decided to break out the sample of Summer Storm I had. First impressions is it had too much of a dirt smell. Once lathered, the dirt calms down and more floral scents pop out. The smell of rain is definitely there as well. Very good scent overall and I don't think I need to comment on the performance of a CFG soap.\n\nB&M Awesome is interesting. I get a grape scent with some bug spray notes. Not overall the greatest scent but it's not the worst either.\n\nOne more day folks. I hope your shaves are good today.",

I love the pairing of Tabac with Barrister's Reserve. It takes me 3 days to get through the little ketchup pack of BR, so I just do Tabac/BR for 3 days straight. Today was my last day of that cycle.\n\nIt was a great shave. A legendary shave. Smooth as silk. My face feels great (I've been upping my use of pre-shave butter lately which has made a world of difference). But...I cut myself on my chin. Bad. This was super irritating because otherwise this was a completely irritation-less shave. It was a shave for the ages.\n\nExcept for this bleeding slice on my chin. I don't even know why it happened. It just...happened. And it's like practically impossible to slice yourself on an injector. So I should actually be proud of myself for managing to get such a big cut on a razor that is practically foolproof.\n\nStupid chin.",

After a couple passes on his face (rinsing his razor after each swipe), he needed extra territory to shave so naturally he lathered up his chest and went to town.

As everyone is aware, B&M \"Latha\" line is the best bang for the buck in shave soap. Actually, it can hold its own against the \"white label\" IMHO. I finished this morning's shave with a sample of CL *4th & Pine*. I don't know if it is the toner or the aftershave since the aftershave is extremely soothing as well. I am on record as guessing: TONER. Fuckin' Friday! Yes! Great shaves to all.",

I mean, that's not entirely true, but I pretty much have planned out the limited edition soaps I want for the year and only occasionally buy myself hardware. Also, I'm a B&M fanboy and tend to spend my limited shaving budget on Will's products.\n\nI found myself with a little extra money this month and, with my birthday coming up soon, decided to treat myself to some samples. I had already planned on placing an order since I'm running out of my pre-shave butter, and decided I would bump it up to get free shipping.\n\nThe mail call will have to wait for Mail Call Monday, but I decided to get myself 4 MLS samples and a few aftershave samples. I got the box this afternoon and immediately sniffed my way through the samples before settling on the Grand Havana and what seemed like a good aftershave match to me: the Floid Black.\n\nOverall I'm pleased with the products. I had trouble getting a good lather with the soap, but I blame that on mistakingly using too much water and not the soap itself. The fragrance was pleasant and I could smell the hint of a good cigar coming through. The Floid Black was nice--but the fragrance is a bit overwhelming. I'm not sure if that's the fault of the AS or the fault of me putting too much on my face.\n\nIn other shaving news, I decided, for the first time in years, to use alum again. I used it when I first started but for some reason thought I was allergic to it. Since it was only a couple of extra bucks on my order I put one in my cart. So far no reaction and my face feels nice. I plan on using it for a week and seeing how it goes.\n\nHave a great Friday!",

I got a sample of it yesterday and liked it. Thought it had a classic, masculine scent. Reminds me of what my granddad would wear.\n\nSo I'm getting ready for a wedding this morning and decided to use it again. Came out of the bathroom and my fiancée declared that, quote, \"You smell like a department store. Get away from me.\"\n\nSo, I guess no more Floid Black for me. I'm hoping it will fade. I think I'll thrown on some Night Music on our way out.\n\nIn other news, someone please stop me from chasing BBS. I fucked up my under chin area. The rest of the Shave is great, except for the red blotches all under my chin because I hate my under-chin stubble. In the future I need to remember a little bit of stubble is better than massive red blotches.\n\nHave a wonderful Saturday!",

Speaking of unused brushes, my Vie-Long horse brush is gathering dust as well. I've used it just a few times, but found it unremarkable. I better try it again.",

The Single Edge.](http://i.imgur.com/xJo9gXo.jpg)\n\n* **Prep:** Post gym shower, CFG Preshave Gel (wishing it was the mentholated version...)\n\n* **Brush:** Rubberset 400-3 w/ Romera Manchurian Fan\n\n* **Soap:** Mickey Lee Soapworks Reunion\n\n* **Razor:** Supply Provision Co's The Single Edge\n\n* **Blade:** Personna (Ted Pella) Coated Injector (1)\n\n* **Post:** Mikey Lee Soapworks Reunion\n\nSo this was my first go with The Single Edge. As many of you know (because I bragged about it a bunch) I was the first backer. I asked for something cool since I was numero uno and the guys over there agreed to give me one of their 3D printed prototypes. Don't know that I would ever try to give it a shave, but it looks pretty damn nifty if I do say so myself. Thanks again /u/SUPPLYProvisionCo! So on to business. Lathered up as usual enjoying the hell out of this Romera knot and proceeded to knock down my \"I've been sick for a while and haven't shaved\" 5 day stubble. The weight and balance of the razor is spot on for me, I find it very comfortable. I really like the thin profile injector head as well, it makes it maneuverable in a way that I just could never get from some larger SE's like the 'Goose. As far as the shave goes... it was excellent. I must admit that with the amount of hair I had going on I probably should have moved up from the \"normal\" plate to the aggressive but I thought I should start with the normal one since I was in unfamiliar territory. It was probably a little milder than my Schick '66. A bit more aggressive than say... my Aristocrat Junior, but nowhere near most of my other SE's. I think the aggressive plate might have mowed through it a little quicker, but results are results. It gave me a close (2 pass) and very comfortable shave. I found it easy to angle correctly and its weight made using no pressure very easy. All in all I'm very glad I grabbed one of these. I'll have to use the aggressive plate next time and see what I think. Hell I might even be able to shave daily if I use the gentle plate lol. I think I might contact them to see if I can get a backup attachment screw though, I can see myself losing it because that's just the way I am.\n\nI made it through my first Father's Day without my dad. Sucks. I spent the day honoring him by working on the lathe! Happy Monday everyone.",

My, then, girlfriend and I went to an awards dinner dance held by a local theatre company that we both worked for and met at. The evening was wonderful and was brought to an amazing conclusion when she accepted my proposal to marry her! So, I thought this incredibly good luck shave involved a repeat this morning.\n\nHere's a photo of us at the dance, as well as the obligatory ring shot taken the next day.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/a/2nlUE",

My daughters stayed with my wife and I all weekend. BONUS: They surprised me with 1 oz. bottle of my all-time favorite designer fragrance - *Clive Christian's 1872 for men*. It's crazy expensive, but I've never worn it without at least one compliment on the scent. Never!\n\nAfter skipping yesterday's shave, I went for my old reliable C&S No. 88 lather, and put a brand new Feather Stainless blade into my AS-D2. That combo just laughs at a full 48 hours of beard growth! Awesome shave, man!\n\nY'all have a great week!",

Needless to say, it was time for a cool water shave. I realized that I don't have any menthol soaps (save for a tube of C.O. Bigelow cream), so the MLS got the honors. I also got in the Super Speed. Save for the side guards missing it's in better shape than the other '52 I have. It also seems to shave better. Also, I've noticed that, for me anyway, the GSBs are really sharp on the first shave but on subsequent shaves it smooths out. Is this just me or is this true for everyone and I've just now figured it out?",

This is what Semogue should strive for in a boar brush. I know that is sacrilege, but it is such a relief to knot (har-har) have to test/hand lather forever just to get a brush to begin to be useful. This is not a small brush. The break-in they do does wonders. This is more broken in than my 1305 which I have had for over 2 years and pretty much sits on the bench. Bonus is this thing was a whopping $6.99! Shave today was fantastic. When I want a BBS/DFS shave without effort, the H2 is the only razor that can do it without doing multiple passes.

I had been particularly looking forward to MLS Reunion after reading such great reviews of it here and on other shaving forums.\n\nThe reviews did not lie. MLS has a great performing soap, and I was impressed by the straightforward scent of, well, forest that I got from this soap. Not pine forest, but a deciduous, Adirondack forest in the late summer. I wish there was a bit more to the scent, an extra layer perhaps. But still the ability of MLS to capture the perfect scent of the forest was impressive to me.\n\nI continue to strike out with my aftershave samples, however. This was my first time using a Fine product and I really enjoyed the performance. Nice face feel while going on and even now, about 30 minutes later. But the scent...this reminds me of orange tang. Now, I'm going to keep it up because sometimes I get strange takes off first smells (e.g., Roam Koyvu I first thought smelled like soy sauce but now I love it). But I wasn't as impressed as I hoped I would be.\n\nGod, please let my PTFEs come in from England.\n\nHave a great day!",

I had 4 days of growth on my face. I had a really bad experience with the fine Superlite the last time and I gave my face some time to heal. I feel so much better, I absolutely hate having stubble on my face it makes me feel dirty.\n\nIt was so satisfying watching my little super speed mow down all that hair. Perfectly smooth BBS shave, no nicks or irritation. Just fantastic.\n\nAlso glad that today's weather isn't going to be HotasBalls°F.\n\nHave a great tuesday guys!",

Lather was better than I expected, since the brush isn't broken in, but that could be because Fine soap is an excellent lather. There's a bit of Boar smell, which will hopefully go away soon! I only started using Feathers last week because I was so worried about them being too sharp, since everyone says they hack up your face if you're not careful. I'm loving them so far! Today's blade cut through two days growth with ease, and left things pretty close to BBS! I can't wait to get this brush broken in - it's a beauty!",

A conversation that I had with /u/praise_the_fireborn about the differences between Mr. Fine's new *Green Vetiver* and his former *Clean Vetiver* scents prompted me to order a puck of his soap (I'd been meaning to try it out anyway) and a bottle of the new splash so that I could compare it against the sample of *Clean Vetiver* that I have. I did a quick first impression sniff test, and the new one does smell a bit...greener...than the old scent. I think it may be the tobacco notes, but I'm not sure. It reminds me a lot more of *Réunion* than *Clean Vetiver* did, and I think it may be a great complement to that soap. I'll have to get my nose into the two soaps at some point and do a comparison of them. I think I like it a little better than the older scent.\n\nSpeaking of the soap, it does perform a lot like Tabac: Excellent slickness, little to no residual slickness and good-not-great post shave feel. Actually, when I smelled *Green Vetiver* on the puck it reminded me a lot of Tabac, which I found odd. I wonder if that's the soap base rather than the scent profile coming through? Does anyone get that from any of the other Fine scents? If I had more mugs to house them, I'd buy a few more pucks of this stuff. It's definitely worth having around.\n\nI chatted briefly yesterday with /u/heybobitsme about GSBs and Kronas, and it put a bug in my ear, so I decided to shave with my Krona today. This was the 8th shave on the GSB in it, and so far the shaves had all been ridiculously comfortable and efficient. Today was a little different: it was still ridiculously comfortable and efficient, but it also gave me a 2-pass BBS shave. Incredible.\n\nAll in all a fantastic shave today. I hope all of yours are as good. Happy Hump Day!",

Also one cannot say enough about pantie dropper, it's such a great scent and I really think they should bring it back and I don't think I'm alone on that. Have a good day people.",

This is not a cream, this is not a soap. But what is this? Loaded the brush as I'd normally do and got about 10-pass worth of lather available. The citrus scent with that is simply amazing. Cannot really describe as I suck at it, but I can say it's definitely very unique in terms of citrusy scent. I'll have to use a few more times to comment on the overall performance, but I've got nothing wrong to say about it so far. One of my greatest shaves lately, BBS without any irritation whatsoever, great post-shave feel.Was on the fence re: keeping the Wolfman OC or not but this shave convinced me to keep it (at least for another while).",

I plan on always having some of this stuff in the den.\n\nThe 24mm Maggard performs adequately, but it's just too large--lofty and bulby--for my taste.

This piece looks and feels amazing and the quality at the price is unmatched in the artisan space IMO. For those of you who enjoy, video shave later on.\n",

I started wet shaving with RazoRock XXX, and this brought me right back to that! Scent was spot on and performance was everything that I come to expect from Stirling. A little more menthol than I expected in the aftershave but I found it pleasant today due to the muggy weather. Texas on Fire won my heart but Piacenza really swept me off of my feet.",

So instead of going with CFG Friday I decided to go with cape verde. This has to be one of the slickest soaps I have ever used. I think it has something to do with the new formula. The old formula kraken is not this slick. The razor glided effortlessly across my face. And the scent is glorious! I have this new attraction towards all things lavender and this soap is simply amazing.\n\nHuge thanks for my summer swap gifter /u/hughmonstah for sending me a whole lot of shaving goodies!",

It's actually really nice stuff. It's a really hard puck with a clean soapy smell that I would say borders on a little cologne-y. For me it lathered extremely easily and created a wonderful creamy lather. It wasn't quite as slick as most of the newer artisan soaps that I'm used to, nor is it's post shave qualities as good but that would be expected. It's a commercial non-tallow (I think) soap afterall. It's a bit drying, but it's hot as hell so it's no problem. Hence the Snakebite :-)\n\nThe brush was a fun one. I got the thing in a trade for practically nothing. The handle is great, but unfortunately the Pure Badger grade is like lathering with satan's toothbrush. Couldn't handle that mess so I grabbed a Best B2 from TGN, removed the old knot, opened the hole up a bit and popped it in. Absolutely wonderful feeling brush now. It feels **very** similar to Simpson Best imo, though not quite as dense. I'm really enjoying the Best brushes here lately. They are soft, usable amounts of backbone, and fairly cheap.\n\nThe Maggard razor was fine, not a favorite or anything but completely passable. Feels a little harsh compared to my regular razors but that's just likely me being unfamiliar with it since I've not used it much.\n\nGlad it's Friday! To all my UK friends, I hope that the referendum came out to your satisfaction. Good or bad, at least the people's voice was heard. Now we wait to see what global effects are going to be. Best of luck to everyone involved!",

I had no idea what blade to use, I heard this razor is really picky with blades so I went with what was familiar to me, Rapira Platinums, they did not disappoint. The weight of the razor was really different for me I never shaved with anything so heavy! I took my time at first, but as I got used to the weight I took the same pace I did with any other razor. 3 passes and a touch up, BBS, and I only cut myself once on the chin.\n\nThis razor is great, and I'm glad I made the purchase, it's very smooth, it has a lot of blade feel to suggest that it is aggressive, and it does feel pretty scary but it's surprisingly pretty mild, and VERY effective, great shave today.\n\nI hope you all have a fantastic friday :)",

This was my first time using it and wow! Every review said that it was cold, but that is an understatement. This was like sticking your face on a freezing winter morning where everything smells like Vick's VapoRub. It made my eyes water! It has awesome sickness. With a fresh GSB in my Krona, I had a great shave. I don't know how much I can actually use this stuff, I may pick up something else for my menthol needs. Maybe Krampert's.",

Slick and abundant and a perfect shave. The fragrance is absolutely first rate and highly enjoyable. I know that because I kept on smelling the brush as I carried it back to its position in my repurposed and converted rubber stamp holder. Excellent brush and excellent shaving lather.\n\nMy Steampunk Tech and its Polsilver SI slid through this abundant slickness reducing my beard on each of its 3 passes as it is supposed to do and I am as near BBS without quite being there as is possible. This is almost my one year anniversary with this razor that I bought from Delta Echo. I received it right around July 4th last year.\n\nCedre & Oranger is a very nice match for XXX.",

Since it was nice out, I actually walked there! It is only a little over 2 miles. A quick shout-out as well as a \"DAMN YOU!\" to /u/Huckleberryking. I really don't *need* more products and I actually went there to pick up some Thayers. Anyhow, first go with the all-natural Esbjerg shaving cream. I started with a damp brush and added water as I built my lather. This stuff ranks right at the top with Cade *RICH* and Baume.Be creams. Very slick with fantastic post shave feel. Just like the two mentioned creams, it takes very little product to produce a shit-ton of lather. I skipped yesterday's shave, so 2 days growth were mowed down with zero irritation or issue. The *Orange Vetiver* starts out with the orange and mellows as you go with the vetiver. Quite a nice scent. Another highly recommended shave product. Great Sunday shaves to all.",

Spent my evening working on that fun stuff.\n\nReally enjoyed this morning's shave. The second shave on the Personna blade is always better than the first and the Single Edge was great. I left it with the regular plate and it just erased my relatively short stubble with no fuss. I had restored the brush with an Ubersoft II but it just didn't impress me. I swapped it out with a Game Changer and I think I'm going to like it better. I may still yet try out the TGN 3 Band synthetic before I decide what to leave in there, but I'm happy with it ATM. Love the Black Tie/Debonair combo, wish that Strop Shoppe hadn't closed the doors but I'll just use and enjoy what I have while I have it!\n\nHappy Monday. Wish me luck. First day on a new phone system and a bunch of users who don't much care for change...",

Not sure I can judge it properly. Only was able to get a pass or so with Shumate before finishing up with my 40's Super Speed. This Gillette Silver Blue has held up nicely for around 4 shaves. I feel the Tabac and Lucky Tiger Aspen scents play together nicely. Performance on both is excellent. Received a bottle of Armaf Club de Nuit Intense Man from India on Saturday. The bottle exploded all over the the inside of the box. Have to see about getting a refund or replacement bottle. It's Monday; take no prisoners.",

I love the luxury cream formula! Really easy to build lather and super slick! The only issue was that LPV burned my face a bit, which means there's something in it I'm allergic too. Which is funny because I didn't think I had any allergies! So..that wasn't much fun but I toughed it out. Hopefully Le Marche du Rasage doesn't burn this way I was really looking forward to using that one next.\n\nThis shave marks the end for the Rapira. It was really tuggy against the grain. Let's see how a Sharp Edge blade works in this razor.\n\nHave a great day guys!",

(I'll post a picture on tomorrow's SOTD.)\nMy fear of 28mm being too big was totally unfounded. My assumption was based on a Chubby 2 coming in at around 27 mm, but the density of the Paladin is significantly less than the Simpson - for me this is ideal. Even with the knot nowhere close to broken in, I can tell that it won't be a lather hog. Not sure why, but it made the scent of the lather stronger?? Makes no sense, but I smelled the soap a lot more today. Good backbone, nice scrub without a hint of scritch or scratch - for reference, the D01 2 band was so scratchy to my skin that I broke out in hives.\n\nAll around it seems like it is a perfect brush for me. Only bad news is that they are not readily available for people to go pick one up.\n\nThe Supply injector seems pretty good. I did manage to do some damage on my neck on an ATG pass that doesn't make me want to use it tomorrow. I think I just need to get used to the razor a bit, although it shouldn't be much different than any other single edge razor, so I'm not sure.",

I do believe MR has a winner here. The knot size is perfect and the way the handle is shaped allows it to easily rest on the edge of a shaving bowl without risk of coming loose and falling in the lather. Bravo!! Of all my brushes this is the best handle.",

As a shaver with naturally oily skin who always got irritation/ingrowns/etc on my neck, shaving with this razor has almost eliminated that. The XXX performed fine. The scent is a light cologne that doesn't overpower. The blade is one I received as a random add on with a purchase on the B/S/T subreddit. It seemed to perform better on the second shave than the first. Today, being the third, was good as well. I may have just had an odd combination or poor prep on the first shave.\n\nThe Drakkar Noir Balm is something I found in the back of my bathroom drawer a few months back when I was cleaning out. I have no idea how old it is. After a little research, it looks like it was originally only available as part of a gift set. The only time I can remember ever getting a cologne/aftershave type gift set is when I graduated high school (16 years ago) or college (11 years ago), though it may have been given to me somewhere along the way when I was moving or helping someone move and they didn't want to take it. At any rate, I just make sure to shake it real well in case it's settled or separated, and it seems to perform great as an aftershave balm. The scent is that 90's cologne scent that's good, but definitely not overpowering in this form.\n\nI ordered a bunch of Samples from Maggard this past weekend, and they should be arriving today. Nothing worth making a Mail Call post or anything, but I will hopefully be posting to the SOTD thread every other day now with some better options and combinations than I've had in the past (which kept me from posting before.)",

For awhile I've been looking for a cheap aftershave that I can enjoy the smell of and pairs pretty widely with my soaps. Not that I don't love buying expensive, artisanal aftershaves, but it's nice to have a few around that can be widely used. For awhile Aqua Velva Ice Blue has been the only one I've been able to find.\n\nI purchased a sample of Clubman Special Reserve with a little trepidation, since I hate Clubman Original (reminds me of lemon Pledge). However, I had read good things about it online and thought I should try it out. Well, I am impressed. It has a nice classic smell with some depth to it. There are no strange or odd notes (e.g., lemon Pledge) that turn me off to many cheaper aftershaves. The scent is a bit long lasting, but it is mellowing nicely in the hours after my shave.\n\nOverall I think this is a winner. Also finally had a decent shave with the Damaskeene. It's been a troubling razor for me despite having such great reviews in the SE community.\n\nHave a great day, all!",

I skipped the usual under the chin XTG pass and straightway went for ATG. An the end result was no different from the regular WTG, XTG, ATG pass.\n\nI haven't gone ATG on the upper lip in ages and today I felt a bit adventurous and went for it really slowly. The result was a really really close shave with some irritation. So I can rule out ATG on the upper lip for good. I payed extra attention to the blade angle today and I noticed that the initial two passes reduced a substantial amount of stubble than before. So I'm going to go back to WTG, XTG, XTG with extra attention payed to the blade angle tomorrow and see how it goes.\n\nThe lilac vegetal is a sample from /u/ketchuegrast. There were many more soap and aftershave samples too. I have no words to express how thankful I'm for the wonderful gift. I have being a little stressed out lately because of university and the soap business. And this gift filled me with joy. :)",

Both the soap and splash contain lavender in their scent profiles, but both are so much more than that. Speick is an awesome soap. It performs like a maniac, is incredibly slick and its post-shave feel is fantastic. My lather could have used more water, and it was still a champ. I really enjoy the scent, too; it's a nice, spicy floral blend with subtle hints of earthiness.\n\n*Lavanille* is *Lavanille.* I don't know that there's much more I can say about it that I haven't already. I smell like sex, and that's never a bad thing.\n\nMy I2 didn't provide a 2-pass BBS this time, but I only needed minor touch-ups in a couple of spots, and I was working on 3 days' growth instead of my normal two. Still fantastic, and 14 shaves in the blade shows no signs of quitting.\n\nHave a great Thursday, everyone!",

Two types of E2 and a Hydro-Magic. Like anything else it has taken a little while to catch on but I seem to have arrived at a point where I am liking these razors. Pretty easy to find proper angle with a flat head.:-)\n\nI have also been experimenting with soaking my boar brushes for a maximum of two minutes which has resulted in a profound difference as compared to a 10 minute soak while I am showering. As expected I have more backbone to work with so I load more easily, make high quality lather and have more face feel which I like. I tried it and I like it. Now I can understand the love for this brush.\n\nVery nice, 3-pass near BBS shave.",

I got it in the shave stick format because I've heard good things about them for traveling.\n\nI enjoyed the soap quite a bit--it has a nice, clean, barbershop-type scent. I could see me using this soap when I just need something to reach for without thinking too much about the scent. I was less impressed with the shave stick format. I found it hard to get sufficient soap on my face to produce a lather that would last over more than one pass.\n\nI also think I'm giving up on my Schick G2. I used to get great shaves with this thing but it keeps on giving me irritation now and I'm not sure why that is. The Hydro Magic is, well, magical. Truly a great shave, so I used it to clean up my stubble on the 4th pass.\n\nI liked the Floid Amber scent. Hadn't had a chance to use it yet. It seemed like a pretty good aftershave--I liked the feel of it and the scent seemed nice and complex, but not too strong. I think it could be a good one in the long run.\n\nHave a great day!",
