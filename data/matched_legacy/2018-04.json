I have been looking forward to trying out this sample. I really like the sweeter floral scent of this soap, it smells like the nice parts of a flower shop or garden center. The shave went great, again I think I still need to work on my face lathering as it seems that the suds didn't hit their full stride until the third pass (adding a little more water each pass). I didn't put on any post to see how that works for a change. I hope everyone has a great Easter and April.",

Cloudy through mid morning, then gradual clearing, with a high near 51. Breezy, with a southwest wind 15 to 20 mph becoming west in the afternoon. Winds could gust as high as 35 mph. High tide at 12:47this afternoon.\n\nFrom November 1st through March 31st the only thing that I do to my hair is wash it. I call it my winter coat. April 1st is the day that I start shaving my head every other day for the next seven months. As is tradition for the first head shave of the year I used Adagio. I love this scent, and am glad that I was able to get a back up before Will discontinued it.\n\nSurprisingly, the shave didn't take as long as I had anticipated it would. Not a bad shave, but it shouldn't take me nearly as long to get to the level I got to last year doing this. Put on the splash, and got a bit of burning, but again, not as much as I thought I was going to get. Over all the shave went better than I thought it was going to go, but there is still room for improvement.\n\nHave a happy Easter (if you celebrate), and a nice Sunday everyone!\n\nEdit: I'm bad at math",

The NEW is a great shaver but you have to get the angle right. There's a couple spots I'm struggling with ATG that get cut a little too close. Nothing a little alum won't help!\n\nBut, I think I'll only reach for my oldies on weekends when I'm not trying to tear through beard before work.\n\nBeautiful weekend in the Bay Area - our backyard garden is blooming and a wonderful natural perfume is enveloping our little home. Jamestown Gentleman was a perfect match for the day, quite floral. Performance (on the vegan base) is awesome.\n\nWishing everyone great shaves!",

Oh well! 😅 Anyway, this Tabac is getting ever closer. It now looks like a crescent at the bottom of the jar as every shave erodes it away.

He knew that grapefruit was one of my favorite scents, and generously offered to make me a custom grapefruit scent. I had a really great shave with it this morning. Although it's a vegan base, the slickness is terrific. They've also tinkered with the post-shave aspect in this version, and I think it's improved. I kept the citrus theme going with Pinaud lime sec. I like the smell of this splash at first, but it gets a little funky on dry down. I probably won't purchase it when my sample runs out, but we'll see.\n\nHappy Monday everyone!\n",

I mean that quite literally as my lead texted me that his wife had gone into labor and they were headed to the hospital about twenty minutes after I woke up. Since no one else would be there to open the shop early I get to leave a couple of hours later. Anyway, I tried going back to bed but it was too late. By the time I would fall asleep I would have to get up again. So, what is one to do in a situation like this? Why, go for a rare weekday morning shave! Oh, it was a good one too. I believe I have this razor dialed in nicely. It seems I need to ride the cap more on this one than most of my others. This soap has about two shaves left in it. It lasts a long time but once it gets to the end, it wants to go. Also, this brush is coming along nicely still. Splash on a bit of Clubman and top it off with some balm, man my face feels nice.",

First time using a wolfman wr instead of my UAG. Wow what a difference.\n\nThe razor is light as a feather, maybe I'm use to the weight of the steel compared to this, maybe it's aluminum? Not sure, either way it felt like a plastic disposable it was that light! Needless to say it delivered a smooth close shave and I'd love to get my hands on one! Gonna be shaving with this a couple more times.\n\nThanks /u/nex_renegade for lending me this beauty!\n\nHappy shaving all!",

I managed to get a closer shave than yesterday. But, I paid a price. I left a 1/2\" vertical slice almost dead center of my chin. I actually laughed when I did it, because I figured \"it was only a matter of time\". Aaaaand I was right.\n\nStypitc and Alum will *really* wake your ass up on a Monday, when you apply them to a nice fresh cut.\n\nIt's all part of the learning process. I'm enjoying learning the ways of the straight. And I've decided I'm not going to touch my DE until April is over. I'm committing to this.\n\nHappy Monday ya'll!",

I killed off TSM Fougere on Friday. I think due to the softness of Declaration Grooming soap they tend to be used up much quicker than others. I forgot to take a historic picture as /u/cadinsor requested. I'd buy the soap base again but not the sent. No sir.\n\nI received this Cade Cream in a tube for Valentine's Day. I am not overly fond of the smell so I never really used it. Well, time to get rid of it. The shave this morning was decent. I had to use much more cream than I expected as my 28mm B2 knot was a lather hog. Maybe this cream will disappear just as quickly.\n\nDid anyone else notice the hilarious suggestion on TTS.com of Gillette foam?",

Youngsters mainly know Marley as a [ganja](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabis_(drug\\))-smoking [rastafarian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rastafari), but his message was about peace, love, social empowerment and positivity against the backdrop of an amazing rhythm section. [Redemption Song](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redemption_Song) channels all those emotions but with a stripped down production of only Bob on the acoustic guitar. It speaks of freedom beginning with ones own mind. Such a beautiful and bittersweet song from an artist who was taken too soon. \"Emancipate yourselves from mental slavery | None but ourselves can free our minds\". For bonus listening today, Joe Strummer from The Clash and Johnny Cash did an [amazing cover](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ulZP8RUqpF4) of this song which gets me right in the feels everytime I hear it\n\nFor the shave, it was my first time trying Bufflehead. I participated in a Take2/Leave2 offering from /u/ahjoyc2/. He put in some BH samples since not everyone has had the chance to try them. I had a pea-sized sample that I smashed down in my bowl which I was able to whip up into excellent lather in no time. As is typical the first time using a new soap, I did not get water right as it started out a bit too bubbly. As an aside, /u/urfrendlipiro/, could you add some new data points into your awesome site that included \"thirstiness\". Especially when trying out a new soap it would be helpful to know. In any case, I was able to work the soap into a great, slick, rich and heavy lather and the scent was light but pleasing. I totally get why people love Bufflehead, but I don't think I will take the day off from work and/or create a Buffle-bot the next time a release is announced in order to get some.\n\nPost shave, went with CL balm and then my homemade Bay Rum splash, which is my favorite.\n\nGreat start to a Monday. Have a great day!!!",

I had waited till the end of March/early April to try this Soap and almost waited too long.\n\nInitially, it reminded me of Diamond and Petrichor, with the combination of bright grass and damp earth- but man, oh man. The scent notes aren't normally what would be in my wheelhouse but I really loved it. I'm still not sure if the history of ROAM played any role in biasing me or not, but I absolutely adored this shave.\n\nAbout 30 mins afterwards, I began smelling a note similar to what my grandfather would smell like after smoking a cigarette- before he quit. That was a very fond memory that I wasn't expecting at all from a wet shave- its incredible the things that smell can do.\n\nI was able to purchase a set- including the EdT, and am very excited to have one as Roam heads into permanent retirement.",

This scent smells fantastic, I used to love polo green when I was in high school. It got me a lot of compliments. I used to find it at my local Ross as a small kit. Body wash, aftershave balm, and cologne. But now I cant find it. Glad that Stirling came along and brought this scent out.",

I was kind of hesitant after the first shave but its coming in nice. I will probably change it by Wednesday but we shall see\n\nI commented on an simple questions thread asking best way to drill out a handle, and the answers provided were fantastic. I was able to take out the knot that came with it since i wasn't too thrilled with it and switch out the knot. Used an epoxy once i got the loft right and heres to hoping the knot stays on firm.

I've now used Blu, Verde and Nera. They all have a similar cologne aspect to them that is immediately identifiable. I don't know what it is, but it's unique to all of their soaps that I've smelled. Thankfully, it's really great. Nera is extremely well-done, and I would imagine this will become as popular as Blu if not more so based on the scent. Great shave this morning.\n\nHappy Tuesday everyone!",

I'm really enjoying Reunion and I'll probably buy a full bottle or maybe even a set. I'm not gifted at describing fragrances, so I will spare you all an attempt at doing so, but I will share two words that come to mind when I splash it on: green and fresh.\n\nHave a great day!",

I still suck at lathering, I had read this was very thirsty and thought I was going slowly adding the water. The first pass was amazing, very very slick, but after trying to reapply for the second pass on a wet face it got a little too thin. No big deal, just headed back to my loading bowl but I didn't get it back to that happy place on the first pass. Soap performance is outstanding, I am a fan of the simple but well executed scent. I look forward to trying more with it this week. Today was also my first time trying a Derby blade, it did ok nothing super noticeable either way. I did get a few nicks around my goatee but was comfortable and I am happy with how close I got.",

Soap loads easily, maintains slickness, and provides a nice comfortable shave. Smells great as well, but the scent does not stick around very long, which is understandable given the price of fragrance oils. Y'all have a nice day.",

Where to begin? I transferred what turned out to be the last bit of soap, which turned into a cream, in to my Captain's Choice bowl. The Semogue took all of it. I did it! I beat the mighty TABAC! I got the blades from tryablade and loaded one in the Fatip. I lathered up and upon the first stroke I actually said \"whoa\". I had used these blades before but it had been a long while. I don't remember them being this smooth. It cut through a day and a half of growth with ease and was comfortable all three passes. I'm keeping an eye on this blade for sure.",

They are such a fun band to see in concert, complete with the whole [Shakedown Street](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Shakedown%20Street) vibe. In concert, they have songs punctuated with white boy funk, big soaring jams, compositional excellence and truly catchy hooks all set against one of the most amazing and trippy [light shows](https://www.google.com/search?q=phish+light+show&rlz=1C1GGRV_enUS751US751&tbm=isch&source=iu&ictx=1&fir=sgvgQ41Pr0BxRM%253A%252CXQmPkXfTomUGLM%252C_&usg=__eQROM0998yKX12efoJBDMRL9QTg%3D&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj1i_iZ6KDaAhWnsaQKHdpmAscQ9QEINjAD#imgrc=sgvgQ41Pr0BxRM:) ever. Even if you are not a huge fan of the music, the show is a not to be missed experience.[Bouncing Around the Room](http://phish.net/song/bouncing-around-the-room/history) is such a fun, light-hearted singalong and definitely got me going on this rainy Wednesday. I know that hard-core Phish phans such as /u/falcons1583/ probably hate this song, but I am always so glad when it comes up in rotation. \"And I awoke, faintly bouncing round the room |\nThe echo of whomever spoke\"\n\nFor the shave, it was another first timer for me, this time with Wholly Kaw. I got this in a Take2/Leave2 offering organized by /u/ahjoyc2/. I had never tried Wholly Kaw but felt it appropriate to use today after the funny and informative post from the owner of WK about [donkey milk](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/88r53a/wanna_know_more_about_donkey_milk_here_you_go/). Once again, I got the water all wrong which is a consistent problem I have when trying new soap...paging /u/urfrendlipiro/, could you add some new data points into your awesome site that included \"thirstiness\"... Once I got going, though, I was able to whip this up into an unbelievable lather that was thick, slick rich and smelled amazing. It also makes me happy that I got in on the [WK wetshaving exclusive](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/86jsvg/can_you_weather_the_storm_rwetshavings_new_sub/) as I love the soap base and I am excited to add some more to my burgeoning collection.\n\nI understand that Dance with Agrumes was a \"special edition\" soap and it has such a great smell. I can't begin to do it justice, but suffice to say that it combines some of my favorite scents to create an absolutely intoxicating aroma.\n\nPost shave, went with CL balm. I was looking for something similar to the soap to use as the aftershave and the TSM fit the bill. It definitely seems to complement the scent and enhance some of the things I liked best about the soap. I may see if I can get one of the Dance aftershaves on /r/shave_bazaar/ as I really enjoyed this product.\n\nHave a great day!!!",

It's a nice change from a lot of the darker greens we've seen lately. The lather performance was excellent, although the new base with the goat's milk has it beat. I've also been testing out a greener than green Paladin Winston, courtesy of /u/vigilantesd (Thanks!!) It's doing some damage on my soaps and has great face feel. That D4 knot is pretty awesome!\n\nHave a good day everyone!",

I was able to do multiple passes without additional lather, the residual soap was enough for ~5 more slides. For the 13th ish DE shave, I finished with an ATG pass for fun and I was feeling comfortable about it. It went well and no irritation has occurred yet.",

Breezy, with a west wind around 20 mph, with gusts as high as 40 mph. High tide at 3:44 this afternoon.\n\nWith today's theme being Not Popular on Reddit I decided to use a product I got quite a while ago that someone threw in to a trade. This shave was interesting to say the least. Started off with an almond sized dollop on the brush and started lathering on my head. This is when it started to look like I had bubble bath suds on my head. The \"lather\" wasn't very thick, and it just didn't seem right, so I rinsed it off, put another dollop in my hands and just spread it around on my dome. It foamed up a bit while I was doing that, but it didn't last very long, but I decided I was going to tough it out. It was the slickest shave I've ever had. Like slicker than whale shit (which I don't recommend shaving with). Also probably the closest shave that my dome has seen since I started shaving it a few years ago.\n\nWill I us it again? I could see myself using it if it fits a day in the Lather Games, or if it fits another Theme Thursday. But other than that it will be thrown under the sink to be forgotten about by time.\n\nHave a nice Thursday everyone!",

As some of you know, Local Gent made this in partnership with PAA for the local meet up a couple of years ago, which I hear will be happening again this summer. Here's a funny thing, I drove by a small orange grove that was blossoming the other day and it reminded me of this. It smells so good. The performance is a little lacking for today's standards but it's still good. The splash, well, it could go with a little less menthol and a little bit of witch hazel or something. Oh, the blade again was great! It felt like it did the first use. I'm quite happy with it so far.",

This was the first soap I ever bought when I switched from creams to soaps. I love the scent but the performance has been vastly outmatched by some of our other current choices. I didn't get much slickness, frothy lather or residual slickness from the soap base. I should note that my water was super hard this morning from doing a water change on my aquariums last night. Whenever I do a water change I need to bypass the water softener and then the hot water tank gets filled with nonsoftened water. I'm going to revisit the soap once the soft water returns...maybe even tomorrow?\n\nAnyone around here follow The Masters tournament? I only follow because of the large pool we do at work.",

I had it in my hand then put it away, then got it back out, but I just couldn't. Honestly, I kinda thought there'd be more attempts with the ol' cartridge posted, now I'm bummed I didn't follow through. ANYwho, I've had this soap since I got it at last year's Maggards meet-up, never used it until today. I liked the scent since the day I got it, just never made it in my rotation. Easy to lather, enough for 3-passes, and the aftershave I thought was really pleasant. At first whiff I got a hint of Beaudelaire, which is always a good thing.\n",

Ballenclaugh is one of only 2 other shaving soap makers that I know of in my state (Ogallala Bay Rum) is the other. Ballenclaugh is a pretty small operation that has been around for a long time. He is known for strong and polarizing scents. The Woodsman is the strongest scented soap I've ever smelled. It is a cross between CFG's Pine Tar and B&M's Roam with an interesting citrus note that comes at the end. I highly recommend Ballenclaugh for anyone wanting something a little different. His soaps are only available on his Facebook page now as far as I know. Moving on, the Perfecto was my first brush because obviously Amazon reviews should be trusted! Although, honestly it's not a terrible brush, there are just much better options for the price. The Viking's Blade I received from my sister. I'm sad she overpayed for what is essentially a Baili 191 with stripes. That being said, this razor is worth $40+, but why pay $40 when you can get it for 1/4 of the price. If you haven't tried the 191 I highly recommend it. Finally, Uncle Jon's isn't that popular around here. This splash was from an exclusive he did for a small state group I'm in. Splash smells great, but I'm not a big fan of alcohol free splashes, or at least I've never found one I liked.",

From memory it was a pretty good soap that was just as good as most things out there. I think it actually misses some of the elite attributes that a lot of the \"Reddit favorites\" possess, but it doesn't necessarily have any deficiencies. What steers me away from using them more often is really the scents being all dupes rather than unique artistan-crafted fragrances. Got a good shave today, balm stung a little but not as bad as the last VY balm I used. My interactions with (VY artisan) Monica have been very pleasant and she's very personable and responsive. I think if you're one who enjoys pairing soaps with frags you own, or having a huge variety of options, VY would be right up your alley.",

This combination makes quite a bit of sense, as many of their products that once had a medicinal use now have a cosmetic one. In a [2015 CNN Travel article](https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/florence-apothecary/index.html) about SMN, Gianluca Foa, the pharmacy's commercial director, gave the example of their Acqua de Rosa, \"When the Black Death arrived in Europe in the mid-14th century, wiping out 70% of Florence's population, the monks began making a rosewater distillate to use as an antiseptic to disinfect homes. 'The Acqua di Rose is still one of our best-selling products; of course it's now used as an astringent toner and perfume rather than a disinfectant.\"\n\nI visited SMN during a trip to Florence last year. It was one of the most beautiful buildings I've ever been in, and [my photos hardly do it justice](https://imgur.com/a/V7pj7). It's a Mecca for anyone who loves fragrances-you can try anything while surrounded by ancient medicinal artifacts, beautiful frescoes, and stained glass.\n\nWhile I am very happy with my aftershave, I will tell you their soap offerings leave something to be desired. They only offer one soap, and nearly everyone you run in to when buying this soap overemphasizes that it is shaving soap for use with a brush, like you're buying some controlled substance or something. As you can see from my above pictures, the soap comes in a large tub and has a simple scent. The jar claims it is scented with Tobacco Toscano, but by far the dominant note is eucalyptus and menthol, with Tobacco Toscano hiding underneath. Their aftershaves come in a large variety of scents-I chose the Tobacco Toscano and am very pleased both with the fragrance and performance of the aftershave.\n\nWhile SMN's soaps don't rise to the level that they should be popular on Reddit, I think their fragrances and aftershaves ought to get a lot more traction in our community. And if you're in Florence, you simply must visit SMN. You will not be disappointed.\n\nEDIT: Fixed link formatting.",

For the theme (not popular on Reddit), I went a little different. I think Frozen Tundra is a popular use, especially on a hot, humid August day. My take on not popular is menthol on a below freezing day. I'm not a huge menthol guy even on the hottest of days. Proraso green and CL Colbeck is about the coldest I can go. So today in Boston area it was 27F degrees and howling wind in the morning, and I can't imagine many would normally reach for something as cold as Tundra. It is a very earthy smell, which I love, but my face was absolutely freezing by the end, especially with a full dousing of the AS splash. Then I had to walk my dogs around the block and I was miserable...but I took the challenge. NOT POPULAR ON REDDIT!!!\n\nHave a great day!!!",

I've never seen anyone use it here. I doubt it's even that popular on Connaught Shaving. But, you know, they bought those five kilo blocks and have already sliced them up for individual sale, and they'll be goddamned (or \"buggered\" or whatever) if they let those bloody wankers from Italy get one over on them, so they're going to ride it out until every last piece is sold, come hell or high water.\n\nAnd a Kent BK8 is hardly popular on reddit either. Who likes a pillow soft 3-band luxury silvertip anymore? Unless it's so scrubby that it can scrub your damn head clean off your shoulders, you can miss reddit with all that soft brush nonsense.\n\nAnd a Merkur 34C, the best selling safety razor on Amazon, and most likely the entire world? Pfffft. Hard, hard pass.\n\nAnd poor Feather. It's not a bad blade by any stretch -- and in fact, it's quite good in the Merkur -- but it's been undone by its silly mythology (\"whoa, bro. Don't even think about using a Feather until you've been shaving for at least 5 years and have your technique down perfectly. Otherwise, the Feather will sense your weakness, rise up against you, and slice through AT LEAST 7 layers of skin, if not all the way through muscle, sinews, and jawbone, and leaving you permanently disfigured. Be careful, man.\")\n\nAnd Country Club aftershave gets no attention, and honestly for good reason. But it smells pretty nice, I suppose.",

Indeed, my soap collection reads like a veritable *\"Who's Who of Top Tier Vendors\"* (as told by /r/Wetshaving).\n\nSo I dug into the dark corners of the linen closet and found something that's certain to lack popularity around here: [Dial Antibacterial Soap](https://resources.cleanitsupply.com/LARGE/USSCO/183197.JPG).\n\nWhat it lacks in cushion and residual sickness, it more than makes up for in sterile commercial disinfectant smell. I waffled briefly, but ultimately I opted to put Sherlock AS over the top of it, to help mitigate the soul crushing scent of disinfected nursing home hallway.\n\nGerm Genociding soap aside, something clicked today with the angle I've been holding my razor and I got a real solid close shave, without any nicks or stabbings today. Progress!\n\nHappy Thursday ya'll.",

Oleo is not unknown in these parts (AMA this Saturday 4/7) but I don't see much love for their vegan based soaps in SOTD posts. I really do like this soap, it is a super fresh scent and the performance is consistent and excellent. I also like the balm formulation, because it contains alcohol its sort of like a aftershave and balm together, I have found it very nice and the scent sticks around for a couple hours hopefully with out being too overpowering.\n\nFriendly poke to /u/urfrendlipiro to perhaps synergize adding the Oleo line to TTS in time for/around the AMA.",

Lavender all around. It may take me a while to get to know CF as well as I knew Cade Rich, but using CF every Friday will afford me that opportunity.\n\nUsing a wedge is just so different from a full hollow. Almost no audible feedback and the weight is substantial. Hopefully I'll find the time this weekend to tune a couple of razors that could use it.\n\nOff to finish off a busy week at work.",

High near 37. South wind 5 to 15 mph. Chance of precipitation is 80%. Total daytime snow accumulation of less than one inch possible. High tide at 4:33 this afternoon.\n\nNice shave this morning.\nI really like this Fragrance. This one will probably merit a full bottle once I kill the sample. It seems like the mellow cousin to your strung out family, played by Xerjoff 40 Knots. It makes me wish that I had more aquatic scents to use with it, but it works well with what I consider Spring scents.\nTime to get the Small One on the bus then off a slow day at work which is going to suck.\n\nHave a nice Friday everyone!",

Handle needs a knot, and will hopefully be getting one soon enough. Here's one [photo](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bg4vlh-BvnP/?taken-by=dogwoodhandcrafts) coustesy of /u/Phteven_j. The phnadle just blew me away, it's really something else! Basically I said, here's a charm I want in there, LoZ theme, I trust you with the rest.\n\nThe soap, at first I opened it and was overwhelmed by the scent. Let the sample settle for a couple minutes then went back and well, it's a fantastic scent. Nice and smokey. I'm horrible with scent notes, so I won't try to describe it any further, but it's definitely a winning scent in my books.",

Since then, I've only ever used TOBS soaps and Feather blades, and I've just accepted that my face wouldn't ever be smooth and that irritation was a fact of life.\n\n\nThis was my first shave ever that wasn't either a Feather or a Cartridge paired with goop or TOBS. It is the single best shave I've ever had. My face is actually BBS with no redness or irritation. I just cannot believe how good my face feels right now. I also bought the Roam blind and absolutely love it. It's such a good scent.\n\n\nThank you guys and the good people at /r/wicked_edge for showing me that there is more than just Feathers and TOBS, and for giving me a clean shave and no redness for the first time in years.",

Down a person and with no one else to pick up the slack, I've been putting in work and a bit of overtime just to make sure everything stays on par.\n\nOn to the shave, I may have to downgrade the Feather in the QShave. I thought it was my vicarious technique and speed yesterday, but a milder and more alert approach still left me with some weepers and a cut onto the base of a small pimple that was coming in. The same blade in the iKon X3 mowed down 3-4 days of growth in my usual 3 passes and was just butter all around. I'll have to remember to not put any Feathers in my QShave from now on.\n\nAfter applying some styptic to the weepers and cut, I splashed some Thayer's Lavender and chased it with the Stirling Balm. I really wanted to go with a Chatillon Lux Salve to help my face out a bit more, but the ones I have are a touch too dark for today's beautiful day.",

I hope to find a good straight for a cheap price. There is a vendor that has several razors, but I don't like the guy and his prices are just a bit too high for me.

My girlfriend absolutely loves the Roam. According to her it's her absolute favorite. It's incredibly ironic because out of us I'm the one from the country and she's from the city. Either way, I'm glad she likes it because I absolutely adore it.\n\nAnyway, started the shave with the Israeli Personnas in my ever continuing attempt to find \"my blade\" after years of destroying my face with Feathers. It... uh... didn't go well. All of the discomfort of the Feather with none of the sharpness. It didn't clear my stubble as nicely as the GSB from yesterday, either. It was so bad, in fact, that after a pass and a half I pulled it and threw my GSB from yesterday back in in an attempt to clean up the poor shave I had gotten at that point. Oh well, live and learn. That's why I got the sampler pack. Tomorrow will be the Gillette 7 O'Clock Blacks, which I hope will go better.",

It's a faux ivory handle with a beautiful cocobolo ring, knotted with a cashmere knot. A Dogwood Handcrafts \"rescue\". (Made by an unknown someone else, with really odd proportions; graciously reworked and saved by the prodigious /u/Phteven_j.) Too small for the previous owners yuuuuge man hands, it fits perfectly in my diminutive little paws.\n\n*Straight Razor Shaving News*\nWhat a great shave! Today was Straight Razor shave #7. Probably my best shave so far. I got up early, while the house was still quiet. Nice shower, put on some music while I prepped. I got the angles right - the razor felt confident and sure in my hands. And I came away with a 100% irritation free single pass shave. (It's Saturday, so I did a single pass only, to let my face rest and heal a bit). But even still, it was a good close shave. Booyah!\n\n*Saturday Events*\nMy 6 year old got 2nd place in his Pack Pinewood Derby last month. This morning is the District Race. So we're off to see how ol' *[Bailing Wire N' Duct Tape](https://imgur.com/WtnmFdG)* will fair.\n\nHappy Saturday ya'll.",

This scent mixture description really had me intrigued and it did deliver a nice blend that my wife likes. This brush is so much easier to lather with than the badger I use mid-week, so I was happy with the suds and performance. For the short term I didn't do any post shave as I wanted to preserve the soap scent for a bit, but my neck is feeling a little prickly so I will likely follow up with some balm at some point today.

I've got to say it is a unique beast of a soap and like nothing else I've used. When I was loading the brush it had those \"strings\" like declaration soaps get when loading but the difference was that it was very hard get those strings to go away. With my first pass it was like putting ectoplasm on my beard but wooooooooo, what a slick soap! It has a crazy residual glide for buffing up any spots you miss. My second and third passes were much better, however. I just need to learn how to use this soap. Following up with TSM Fougere is a winning combo. I think GSB might be a bit too aggressive for me though and might switch back to voskhods tomorrow :)",

I have had irritation on my neck since I started wetshaving, and never really solved the problem. Hence why I tried the slant.\n\nI was expecting a very comfortable shave, since I read that slants are for those with a thick beard and sensitive skin. But man, it really gave me some razor burn. The alum stung the most out of any shave so far. I usually do a wtg and xtg on my face, then two wtg on my neck (since it's so sensitive, and I still get razor burn) and it felt like the slant was tearing up my skin whenever I did a pass in the same direction.\n\nIs this a normal experience for you all with slants? Is the razor just so efficient that I shouldn't be doing two passes in the same direction? I really would like the slant to be the solution to my neck irritation. Maybe I need to use a less aggressive blade on slants?",

It's still less smooth than the GSB and had more tugging. I think these are a good blade, but I think so far my blade seems to be the Silver Blue. I'll use that tomorrow and then will give the Astra or Wilkinson Sword a try on Tuesday.\n",

Santa Paula is an interesting scent. Very orange forward, like the zest with a slightly woody background, probably from the cedar. The splash is more of the same with the cedar coming out after a few minutes.\n\nOn another note, I've been very satisfied with this blade. After five shaves it's just as smooth as the first. I've been trying to do some research on this blade and because I've seen conflicting stories about whether they're still made in the USA and I can't find any definite information except for articles written three years ago. It's not anything patriotic, I just think it would be cool to have some American made blades. Oh well, I'm leaning towards getting a 100 pack in the near future, regardless. But I'm going to try it out in a few of my other razors before I do.",

Somehow still managed to pop awake before 7. After a week on the beach, it's tough to adjust to our gray, rainy weather and I wanted something bright to start the day. I went to the mail pile and fished out the Barrister and Mann box that arrived on Friday to give Jacinthe a try because diving into Bay Rum would have been a bit cliche.\n\nI definitely got the \"Lemon Pez\" scent off the puck. But once I started lathering, I was genuinely shocked as the tomato leaf notes rang through loud and clear. Tomato leaf was one of the parts of the scent profile I figured wouldn't really stand out, but it did and I have to say I love it. The aftershave goes on with an almost overwhelming level of \"Lemon Pez\" and it took a good few minutes for the scent to diversify somewhat. Now, a little more than an hour later, it's a very pleasant white floral and sweet fruit with just a hint of the tomato leaf underneath. I have to say, I'm a huge fan of both the soap and the AS.\n\nI'm not, however, a huge fan of the Barbedeaux blade. Guess I'll be including the remaining blades as samples when I prepare the \"shave like a grownup\" starter kit for my buddy's upcoming birthday.",

I honed it yesterday and I think I could have done better, but it shaved acceptably.\n\nI seem to use Tabac a lot for the first shave with a new (to me) SR.

I've used a RR Hawk before, so I had some frame of reference with razors using blades of this type. The Alumigoose is a very nice razor--it shaves very smoothly compared to the RR Hawk, which always tugged for me just a bit. It was very intuitive to use as well. For someone who has a thick beard, I think this would be a great option as the stiffer blade seems to be suited to mow down thick hair. Back to work after 3 days off.....\n",

Love the scent and its performance.\n\nHowever, I humbly suggest to /u/stirlingsoap:\n\nAcademia Man\n\nYou make decisions and stand by them, despite student whininess and insubordination. You give orders and expect them to be immediately followed, but then you get 20 emails from students asking to repeat them. You walk into a room and some eyes are on you, some are closed, and most are staring at their MacBook screens. You are the Academia Man.\n\nScent notes:\n\n* Bourbon and cedar: the \"desk whiskey\" that your assistantship supervisor gave you years ago that you can't use now because your office is too close to the department chair's.\n* Bitter coffee: the Keurig coffee that the full-time faculty down the hall can make because their office isn't a repurposed storage room.\n* And, lurking underneath, gall (students' attitudes) and vitriol (your feedback on their papers)\n\nEdit:\n\nAnd let me add \"vetiver,\" the \"grass-is-greener\" attitude that administrators have that means that it is impossible to be hired tenure-track at a school where you've:\n\n* graduated from\n* adjuncted at, or\n* been an interim at\n\nbecause no desirable faculty member would ever do any of those things.",

Australian Private Reserve makes some interesting smells and Lightning Ridge is definitely one of them. Exotic fruits like tart lime, guava, and white grapefruit combine to create an intriguing citrus mix with a combo of ozone and petrichor notes, which makes up most of what my nose picks up. I'm not really a fan of petrichor, but this one works well with the theme conceived by APR. Really nice lather and comparable to MLS or Chiseled Face. The aftershave is top-shelf as advertised - very soothing and almost like a balm with a touch of menthol. It compliments the shave extremely well and has a decent longevity on it (about 6 hours for me). Have a great shave today!",

I got a delivery of samples of soap from Stirling (I did happen to forget the aftershave, but that's ok!)\n\nI tried the Executive Man today and absolutely loved it. It doesn't smell nearly as good off the puck (both myself and my girlfriend simply didn't like off the puck), but today when I lathered it it was absolutely fantastic! I'm going to try the Sharp Dressed Man tomorrow in an attempt to find a new \"signature\" scent, because I want to get away from the Eternity since it has no staying power on me.\n\nAny opinions on what one of these would seem better for a College Student as a year round scent would be certainly be appreciated! I'm thinking Exec. Man smells better as a year round, but I'm still not decided. I do know that this is one that I think I want the aftershave of.\n\nOn whatever one I choose, I want to find a matching cologne (certainly not actual Aventus or GIT because I definitely can't afford that as a college student), so if anyone has any suggestions for a matching EdTs that I could actually afford, that would also be quite helpful at this point.\n\nHappy Monday, all!\n\n",

Still just pulling DFS and SAS shaves out of straights but that's fine.\n\nGot the Ohio Farmer for cheap off of the Bay and I'm actually really liking how light the scales are. Makes we want to put these scales on everything bc it makes the razor much more nimble. Also shocked that this thing was shave ready. Was totally planning on honing it but it doesn't need it.\n\nGot some good vintage DEs en route too. If those roll in, Pure Lavender shows up, Picture Day gets ordered and shows up, and Tempest all come in this week, it's gonna be a hell of a mail call next Monday.",

      "body": "Soap: Stubble Buster Coastal\n\nBrush: Dogwood Timberwolf\n\nRazor: Rockwell 6C\n\nBlade: Perma Sharp\n\nPost: Stubble Buster Coastal Splash; Stirling unscented balm\n\nI received this Coastal Set yesterday. I've been wanting to try Stubble Buster since its launch, but have hesitated because I wasn't familiar with a lot of the fragrances that the initial offerings were based on. From what I understand, /u/Chiseledface is rolling out new scent offerings 2 or 3 at a time until he gets into a range of about 15-20 scents. All of the scents are based on (but necessarily identical to) popular cologne fragrances.\n\nThe scent on Coastal is similar (or identical?) to L'Eau d'Issey Pour Homme. It is citrusy, woody and a bit acquatic. It has an initial sharpness that is already mellowing a bit. I like the fragrance quite a bit.\n\nAs for the soap, the soap has a somewhat firm texture. It seems like many soaps at present are veering towards the softer end of the spectrum, and it was actually a nice change of pace to load my brush and not have to worry about overloading with a soft soap. The scent on the puck is mild, but I could definitely smell it. If you're used to soaps that explode with scent when you open the top (cough....FG.....cough), it is not like that. This is not a negative to me, as I like soaps on the mild/mid-strength side. This was also by design, to keep the price of the soap low, and to focus scent strength in the AS where it's better suited anyway.\n\nThe performance is just as everyone has said. It's just terrific. I have no doubt that if this wasn't marketed and priced as a \"budget,\" soap that people would be praising it and comparing it to other soaps that cost $16-20 from other artisans. Slickness and residual slickness are great, and the post-shave is surprisingly good. Absolutely no issues using this soap, and it resulted in a wonderful shave this morning.\n\nThe star of the show for me might actually be the aftershave. My face is extremely smooth right now, with zero irritation or itchiness. I would assume that this is due to the addition of acetylsalicylic acid, but that's just a guess. The scent on the aftershave is strong. It's actually too strong from me (I don't usually wear fragrance as it often gives me a headache), but most people will see this is a major plus. I understand that at some point in the future /u/Chiseledface will release an unscented version of the AS, and I will definitely be picking up some of this to use as a daily driver AS. My initial impression is that the AS is that good. I'm very impressed by it.\n\nMy verdict is that this is an unbelievable value at $17.50 for a set. I will definitely be watching to see the other scent offerings that roll out and plan on buying the others that appeal to me.\n\nHappy Tuesday everyone!",

Henckels 11/16 QH\n**Post:** Lucky Tiger - Oil of Olay Complete\n\nEverything just came together so well today. An effortless shave with a good razor and soap and a new knot. I was using this handle over the weekend and the Cashmere knot popped out when I was rinsing the brush out apparently with a little too much vigor. That actually solved a problem. I have had this mixed knot for some time now and had no handle ready to receive it. I did one defunk lather and then used it today. It worked well for a new mixed knot, but it will evolve with use. I did soak it before I did the initial practice lather, but I didn't share /u/Ptheven_j's urge to fucking drink the shit. Dude. Seriously?",

This citrus bomb is right up my alley, and even if it is still snowing outside I'm ready for some warm and bright fragrances. There's something in the dry down - pretty sure it's petitgrain - which reminds me of AdP, but otherwise it's its own pleasant lemon-y refreshing fragrance. Very glad I picked up this set. I like the scent of the toner and soap more than I do the EdC, but I would probably agree that the EdC needs the extra depth and body so as to not be simply a light citrus blast like the post shave scent is. If you like the toner/AS, I'm pretty sure you'll like the EdC, but I think if you're a citrus fan and for whatever reason don't like the toner/AS, there is still a chance that you'll enjoy the EdC. Sorry if this little write-up isn't very good or helpful in making up your mind about the EdC as I'm sure some of you are on the fence about it. I'll say the two are about 80% similar, and that extra 20% is mostly lemon in the post shave scent and other less citrus/sweet notes in the EdC.",

How it compares to the original i am not sure, but it has that nice clean barbershop scent (reminds me of Lucky Tiger Aspen without the burn/sandal wood), just the right amount of menthol, and true to floid aftershaves, you have to remind yourself that it is alcohol based. Now I need to get the big bottle...come on tax refund!\n",

Speaking of aftershaves, this balm from Hazelet's Apothecary is really excellent. Melts and spreads very easy for a solid balm and doesn't leave me feeling oily. I even used it as a skin moisturizer today since it takes so little to cover a large area. Have a good one, everyone!",

      "body": "\"Help on the Way->Slipknot->Franklin's Tower\" SOTD\n\n**Song:** [Artist: Grateful Dead. Songs: Help on the Way->Slipknot->Franklin's Tower](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzlNWPVBcfk)\n\n**Prep:** glycerin soap, hot shower.\n\n**Brush:** [Stirling 24x51 mm synthetic] (https://www.stirlingsoap.com/collections/shave-brushes/products/synthetic-shave-brush-24mm-x-51mm)\n\n**Soap:** [Stirling Barbershop](https://trythatsoap.com/collection/86/?product_type=soap)\n\n**Razor:** [Stirling DE3P7S](https://www.stirlingsoap.com/collections/safety-razors/products/stainless-steel-handle-de-razor-de3p67)\n\n**Blade:** [Polsilver Super Iridium](http://www.tryablade.com/blade/polsilver-super-iridium)\n\n**Post:** Extra lather, [CL Unscented Balm](https://chatillonlux.com/collections/post-shave-salve/products/unscented-post-shave-salve), [Pinaud Clubman AS](http://www.clubmanonline.com/clubman-after-shave-lotion-6-oz.html)\n\n[The Grateful Dead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead) is my go-to, surefire, A#1 band. I have spent thousands of hours of my life going to their concerts back in the day and listening to their music. Before the days of the Internet, we would mail or trade tapes made of their concerts to fellow [Deadheads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadhead). I had thousands of of cassettes of Dead concerts over the years which I meticulously cataloged and listened to. Help->Slip->Frank (as it was often shortened to) was one of their signature sequeways from one song right into another. The version I linked was a genuine \"break out\" in Hampton,VA where they billed themselves as [formerly The Warlocks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formerly_the_Warlocks) which was their original name before changing. I was not lucky enough to see these 2 shows, but have listened to them many many times. The Help->Slip->Frank sequence is at times soaring, at times psychedelic, at times melodic and then atonal. Of all the playings of this sequence, this version at Hampton is my all time fave. \"One watch by night, one watch by day | If you get confused just listen to the music play\"\n\nFor the shave, I felt like a barshop scent and Stirling Barbershop checks all the boxes. I will also admit to a \"fan-boy\" worship of Stirling since all my hardware came from there as well as my initial batch of software. The lather is slick, rich, creamy and punches waaaaay above it's price. And their samples are yuuuuuuuge. I have more than 10 shaves into this sample and no discernible dent has been made in the soap!\n\nPost shave, went with CL balm and then Clubman, which I have learned to apply only a few drops as it lasts all day. Since I have many meetings today, I didn't want to overpower the room. I couldn't use Clubman every day, but I could easily use it 2-3 times per week. Just awesome scent and decent protection, especially combined with the CL Balm\n\nHave a great day!!!",

Dome shave went well except for where I had a pimple that I was unaware of. I prefer a larger brush for days when I have head shaves, just because of larger surface area. This brush fits the bill exactly, but I don't know how some people use larger brushes, as it barely fits in the jar to load. Or is that just because of the density being off the charts.\n\nHave a nice Wednesday everyone!",

This is from Portugal and a product you don't see very much on Reddit. The spiced citrus scent is fairly mild. It's a bit orangey and soapy.l smelling. The spice is there but is mild.\n\nThe performance of the cream was solid. It seemed to take more water than expected, but did generate a nice, dense lather after a bit. Slickess was quite good, and post shave was decent. Overall, I would recommend this cream if you like to use shaving cream. It's a solid performer. Happy Wednesday!",

Won a Dorko razor in a raffle which arrived yesterday. It's a brand that has been on my want list and it didn't disappoint. Although i only had one day's growth the blade moved effortlessly (some credit to B&M soap too). I posted my first SOTD picture, even though it's not as sharp as i would like i wanted to share. I'm looking forward to many shave with this one.\n\nHappy Tuesday everyone!\n\nEdit: updated URL",

This was my first time using a Declaration soap and it was fantastic. Once I dialed in the right amount of water from the sample, the slickness and feel was perfect. The post shave feel of this soap was awesome too. Smooth and clean, but not greasy like some soaps. I couldn't get enough of the scent, too. I definitely see several tubs of Declaration in my future, and I'm looking forward to my Trismegistus sample next.\n\nAs for the blade, strangely enough, one side of my razor cut like a dream, while the other was a little tuggy. I'm not sure if it wasn't seated evenly, or if it's just the blade.",

Second and third pass both required a few more swirls of soap to thicken up the lather as it continued to thin out with each subsequent pass. Overall I managed an okay lather, but my main goal is to kill the soap and make room for a new one.

Immediately made me feel like I was drinking raspberry lemonade at a picnic, or maybe eating a popsicle in front of the AC. Very easy to load, and it lathered up nicely. It was the slickest shave, but still very protective. It's starting to get warmer and I can see myself starting to use this soap a **LOT** in the coming months.",

I was seriously surprised by this one. I also enjoyed G&T ONTR, really nice floral and menthol kick. I'm starting to hate Clubman Pinaud. I think it's an interesting scent on its own, but it doesn't pair well with anything I have and the scent lasts way too long/is too strong and gets in the way of cologne if I happen to wear any that day.",

Increasing clouds, with a high near 50. West wind 5 to 10 mph becoming south in the afternoon. New precipitation amounts of less than a tenth of an inch possible. High tide at 9:54 tonight.\n\nI don't use Storybook that often, and when I do I am reminded how easy this soap is to lather, and the excellent quality of the lather. For me it's easily in the top three soap bases that I have used.\n\nThe soap has a nice creamy consistency, much like a brie, and goes rather well with crackers. The taste leaves much to be desired, and leaves me wanting something a bit more sweet, maybe if there was a sprinkling of sugar before it was set to cure. Where this combination of products really shines in the liquid. Much stronger scent that lasts even after it you have drunk it, that might be the reason for the mild industrial taste that lingers on the palate. While uncomfortable, is something your doctors and nurses can smell while they pump your stomach.\n\nHave a nice Thursday everyone!",

The aftershave and frags are based off gin, the Colbeck is spot on Gin and Tonic, CL aftershave really dries my skin though so I had to add some moisturizer. Finally, the Juniper Sling is pretty close to gin as well, it's a nice refreshing fragrance, it really does smell like a citrusy gin and tonic. Now to go to work totally smelling like gin.",

I really should use it more because I had an excellent shave this morning. The SBSW base is really terrific in terms of ease of lather, slickness and post shave. I love the lemony tea smell of V&R. Perhaps the star of the show is the aftershave. Something about their formula leaves my face very smooth and happy. It's really great stuff.\n\nHappy Themed Thursday everyone!",

But I will say that when lathered, it smells quite nice. I don't think I'm a floral guy, but I guess with a spring-like day today (high of 67!), it's fitting. Lather was nice and slick, aftershave had a nice fell to it. Got a pretty great shave, but my face needs a break.\n\nHappy trash day!\n",

And since beverages are the theme, I decided Rum (bayrum more specifically) should be the thing of choice. Even for the [hot coffee](https://gettysgear.com/products/the-quartermaster-flavored-coffee) portion of the shave. Island man most people don't think of as a bayrum, but it is in there and the fruit and ylang ylang layers nicely with it...one of those scents no 2 people get the same impression from at work, but they all like it and ask me what it is.",

EdP\n\nDay 4 of 🍊Citrus Week🍋 coincided with Thursday's theme of a \"beverage\" scent. So, a couple of options presented themselves in Stirling's Gin and Tonic, Margaritas in the Arctic, or perhaps Porch Dranks, but I went with the citrus-y lemon, lavender and black tea of Storybook Soapworks' Visions and Revisions, which is based on a variation of the Earl Grey tea scent.\n\nSBSW has an excellent lather to work with (similar to Declaration Grooming), so today was a nice slick shave. The lotion aftershave has surprisingly decent longevity and isn't too tacky. I threw on Imaginary Authors' O, Unknown!, which proved to be a great compliment with its black tea top note. Have a great shave today!",

Beer is a beverage too!\"\n\nHadn't used this bad boy since before winter, I think. I had also been on a killing spree with my Edwin Jagger soap, so this was a great.\n\nI had forgotten how important a properly lathered soap is! I had been getting iffy shaves with the EJ and the ring is so thinned out on it that I was also underloading, which provided a subpar shave.\n\nThis is night and day, great slick, cushiony lather, and a ton of postfeel slickness. Riding this Feather on its 9th 3 pass shave and it was still smooth, thanks to the soap.\n\nSo while this soap doesn't smell exactly like a West Coast IPA, I love that it smells like pure hops. I'm also a homebrewer and this just reminds me of that moment you add in your hops to the boil (or whirpool) and get all these beautiful aromas of citrus, tropical fruits, and pine.\n\nEnjoy your drinks!",

      "body": "\"One More Cup of Coffee\" SOTD\n\n**Song:** [Artist: Bob Dylan. Song: One More Cup of Coffee](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB1Yq4zVC70)\n\n**Prep:** glycerin soap, hot shower.\n\n**Brush:** [Stirling 24x51 mm synthetic] (https://www.stirlingsoap.com/collections/shave-brushes/products/synthetic-shave-brush-24mm-x-51mm)\n\n**Soap:** [Storybook Soapworks Coffee Spoons](https://trythatsoap.com/collection/860/?product_type=soap)\n\n**Razor:** [Stirling DE3P7S](https://www.stirlingsoap.com/collections/safety-razors/products/stainless-steel-handle-de-razor-de3p67)\n\n**Blade:** [Voskhod Teflon](http://www.tryablade.com/blade/voskhod-teflon-coated)\n\n**Post:** Extra lather, [CL Unscented Balm](https://chatillonlux.com/collections/post-shave-salve/products/unscented-post-shave-salve), [Storybook Soapworks Coffee Spoons AS](https://trythatsoap.com/collection/860/?product_type=aftershave_noalc)\n\nThe timing of this themed SOTD was perfect. Just got an order in the mail from SBSW so I was going to use it today regardless of the theme. Instead, I leaned way into the theme today and went with One More Cup of Coffee from one of my favorite Dylan albums, [Desire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desire_(Bob_Dylan_album\\)). It is such a haunting tale of unrequited love, sung during Dylan's [Rolling Thunder Review](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_Thunder_Revue) period. \"One more cup of coffee for the road | One more cup of coffee 'fore I go\"\n\nFor the themed shave (Beverage Scents) I went with my Coffee Spoons. I'm a big coffee guy, though not as much as /u/kctrem/ in that I don't roast my own. It is really my last vice these days so I don't mind indulging. Storybook is one of my absolute favorite soaps and Coffee Spoons is right at the top, in my book. It lathers up thick and rich with amazing face-feel and protection. The soap is a little softer than most and is so easy to whip up into an amazing lather. As to the scent, it is amazing! Just the right blend of coffee and not overpowering at all. Just awesome! If you love coffee but don't want to smell like you spilled a cup on your pants, Coffee Spoons fits the bill.\n\nPost shave, went with CL balm and then more Coffee Spoons with the alcohol-free splash. It prolongs the smell a little, but again, it is not overpowering at all and I can just get faint hints wafting around me 4 hours after I shaved. Love this stuff!!!\n\nHave a great day!!!",

I do love this soap (thanks again /u/starvinghippo). I got a very decent lather out of it and a smooth shave result. The CL salve took over the scent with more leather than vanilla, but I don't mind it. I just imagine someone walking out of Starbucks then into their leather clad SUV (or station wagon in my case).

My skin didn't just feel good- I didn't even feel like I shaved. Soap is super slick, aftershave feels fantastic. Balm is very rich, but in a good way (plus my skin is on the dry side). What a fantastic combo, and the scent is great. Perfect for the summer. I have a new favorite aftershave for sure!\n",

Anyway, this scent in the Declaration Grooming base makes for a really nice experience.\n\nGoing from a wedge to a full hollow razor is...interesting. I used wedges the past couple of days and the audible feedback of the full hollow was deafening by comparison. And I may be imagining things, but I swear I can detect the vibration of the full hollow in a tactile sense. No shit. I think I'll go back to the wedge tomorrow.\n\nFriday at last.",

Small one woke up early so was able to get her breakfast and then shower and shave giving me more time than usual. So time to try the Timeless on the dome. It was okay, had to play around with the angle a little bit. Went to put on the aftershave and holy crap, I didn't do as good a job as I thought I did. I think I will stick the the Schick Grip for the dome shave days, just so intuitive, light, and maneuverable.\n\nUsually I don't like the beginning of Zoologist - Hummingbird, something just strikes me as sickly sweet, but usually after those first few minutes it morphs into a more floral that I can't get enough of. The combo of Santal Auster and Hummingbird brings those first notes down a notch, and combine for something a bit more earthy, and is a scent that looks like I will be a fan of all the way through.\n\nHave a nice Friday everyone!",

It's not been on my radar screen, but I have heard good things about it, and he generously offered to send me a sample. It is certainly one of the classics. The scent was a very mild almond, and the soap was firm. I was concerned it wouldn't lather well due to the small sample size, but I was mistaken. I had no trouble creating a dense lather. This stuff is very slick! As with many of the classic products, the post shave wasn't great, but the slickness was impressive. I'm glad I was able to give it a try. A very happy Friday to all!\n",

Even though I love this scent, with the massive volume of soap I already have, I don't see a replacement on the near horizon.

Swerving and swaying, not staying in his lane, getting passed by people in the right lane -- shit was terrifying. Hell, even my 90 year old grandfather in the backseat was like \"hey, son, watch out.\"\n\nBut don't worry. We're in a gigantic, full sized Suburban, so we should be able to manage to take out quite a few other vehicles on the way to the scene of our own firey deaths.\n\nI managed to commandeer the controls from him during a pit stop at a Love's station. Almost immediately, everyone in the car -- full car, median age of 65 -- fell asleep. The driving was so bad that even the old people who can sleep through blaring TVs and sirens, couldn't relax enough to nod off.\n\nWe got 6 more hours of this today, and at this moment I do NOT have control of the car keys. He needed to grab something out of the car last night at the hotel, and kept the keys.\n\nI'm not a praying man, but I'm finding religion.",

Didn't feel any irritation. Got a one pass shave for my head and a 2 pass shave for my face.\nThis is the first time I didn't soak a badger and ran it under hot water and squeezed water out. I don't know if it worked, seemed dry and kept adding water but I never got that lather I had from the same soap by a synthetic. Still a good shave nonetheless.\n",

After that, it is just the Wilkinson Swords and then I'm through my samplers. For now, both of them are hard-pressed to compete with the Silver Blue.\n\n\nHappy Friday, all!",

I really like the scent. Off the puck it reminds me more of Cardamom, during the shave you get some espresso but post and A/S it's a very smokey Cardamom. Or clearly, I do not know what espresso smells like. Definitely going to be using this in the summer.",

First shave with my puck of Roam. First shave with the Vidyut blade. First splash of Alt Innsbruck, which came in a lot I picked up on r/shave_bazaar.\n\nI'm still making up my mind about the Roam. I don't dislike it (certainly don't hate it), but I'm going to need a couple more shaves to decide how I feel.\n\nI'm not impressed with the Vidyut blades. They're ok, but why should I shave with an ok blade when I've got a drawer full of great blades?\n\nI was surprised by the strength of the Alt Innsbruck. Apparently it's a combo aftershave/cologne. I thought the tobacco scent would pair well with the Roam, but it's more of a tobacco flower than tobacco leaf. Did I mention the scent is stronger than I expected? While the scent of Roam was very outside-in-a-field, the Alt Innsbruck makes me think I'm about to step up to the craps table at the Flamingo in Vegas. It had a nice feel going on, though.\n\nAlso, since it's Friday the 13th, [here's a relevant humor video a friend of mine made for PopCulture.com](https://www.facebook.com/PopCultureHorror/videos/2058353101043826/).",

Yesterday I paired it with Romance in Middlesex (which is an awesome pairing by the way) so today I wanted to just give Sinfonia a chance on its own.

I had been wanting to try this style of razor for awhile. I chose to get ProGuard blades because it was recommended for new users. The blades are interesting in that they are wrapped with wire and aid in not nicking yourself. I wasn't sure how that was supposed to work exactly so gave them a go.\n\nI am very impressed with the CJB. While it is a clone of the Feather Artist Club, it shaves very well. I had a couple weeks growth so I decided to shape up my summer beard. At least having dark/thick facial hair has a plus for once - I completely shaved a couple of weeks ago and already have the ability to shape.\n\nAnyway, after until shaping with a trimmer to knock down the long hairs, I used the CJB to final shave/shape. The ProGuard was a very forgiving blade to me. I actually found it to be like shaving with the Rockwell 6s' R6 plate - it was efficient but also forgiving. It shaved better for me than the R6 plate, of course. I received a DFS shave in one pass. I did do a touch up pass for the 'final' shape of the cheeks and neckline.\n\nI also wanted the back of my neck touched up to the hairline (had some 'duckling' hair). I had my wife do that. She did that without nicking me and that was the first time she has used a shavette. Either she was naturally good or the ProGuard did do what it was designed to.\n\nOverall, I am pleased with the CJB Kamisori. I can see the appeal to the Feather brand, as I am sure QC is better for the extra money.",

I listened to this song this morning because it just puts me in a great mood. It's a fun song and is actually kind of funny, even the video. That scene where Simba and his gf (can't remember the name) are marching through the line of zebra's and they are saluting him and then the bird (can't remember his name either) walks through and they present their asses. I mean c'mon. That's objectively funny. And yes, there is certainly a nostalgia factor involved here.",

The soap seems to be a bit softer than my other Wholly Kaw option, and actually dug up some of the soap with the bristles. Other than that performance is fantastic and leaves my skin feeling nice and soft. With the fragrance I think I smell like I just finished planting some flowers. Over all, I like the scent but the wife does not, so we all know what that means.\n\nHave a nice Saturday everyone!",

It's been a while since I used the YRP. The previous time I used it and I was hit with an almost overwhelming rose scent after about 30 minutes.\n\nThought I'd give it another shot, and it was great. Plenty of citrus in it, I don't really get any patchouli. Not quite sure of what happened last time, perhaps I forgot to shake the bottle of toner first before applying?\n\nCheers",

Not gonna lie, it may take a while for it to grow on me. I don't dislike it, but I'm not blown away by it like some of my other soaps. It's donkey milk base so it is definitely going to get used.\n\nSo I did something stupid and didn't realize it until I was done shaving. I got my razor out and the sudden urge to...take care of business became the most important task at the time. The shave seemed a bit rougher than what it should have. It wasn't until I was cleaning off my razor that I realized I had forgotten to strop my razor. Shit happens. I'll survive.",

Last night, I had a SOTE to get ready for a university sponsored party, and I tried an Astra blade. It was... not good. Lots and lots of irritation and tugging, especially considering the fact that I was only cleaning up 5 o'clock shadow.\n\nMy girlfriend and I left said party early because she's getting over a cold and I'm coming down with it, so I made it to bed at about 1, which isn't terrible all things considered.\n\n\nThen this morning happened. I woke up at 5:50AM to the pleasant sound of the fire alarm in my dorm blaring. Each of our rooms of course has a speaker, so it was nice and loud. I, being in a tired haze, rolled out of bed, put sweats and a t-shirt on, and grabbed the only shoes I had out (my dress shoes from the party). No coat or anything useful. I get outside after evacuating to find it raining and cold, and also to find out that's it is in fact not a drill (a pipe burst and our first floor was apparently flooding). We get moved over to another dorm until the all clear was given, when we found out that they could not actually shut the alarm off. It was beeping and blinking until 7:40 this morning.\n\n\nAll in all, not exactly how I expected to start my morning.",

The scent strength to me is mild to medium, both off the puck and lathered. I get the birch tar somewhat, but I mainly pick up the ozone, which gives it a damp, earthy smell while still having an aquatic hint. It reminds me of both Petrichor and Summer Storm, but it is distinguishable from both for sure. The soap performs wonderfully as I've come to expect from WK, and I really dig the noticeable menthol kick in the aftershave. I think those who've yet to receive their order will be pleased. Much thanks to the collaborators and happy shaves!",

Based on Creed's Virgin Island Water, this is a vacation-invoking scent profile with a blend of mostly exotic citrus scents, musk and rum. I find the scent light off the puck, which is unusual for Stirling, so it could just be an anomaly. That being said, I failed to pick up the aftershave last year, so I'm looking to match it soon (and probably check out their new EdTs if this one is featured). I paired it with Stirling Coconut Lime, which worked quite well. Have a great shave today!",

The 1st shave was incredibly bad. Nicks and cuts everywhere. I was surprised, because this razor has a smaller blade gap (0.58) than my wolfman (0.61), and I have had zero issues using the wolfman.\n\nThe first shave with the Windsor, it was hard for me to find the angle. But I've had much better use with it the 3rd and 4th time I've used it. This razor is the very definition of \"riding the cap\".\n\nThis shave was much better than any of the previous ones. The solution? Riding the cap. Also, pressure. This razor is heavy. Using the weight of the razor only is to much pressure, I have to actively pull it off my skin just a tad, to the point where it glides off of the skin, and not rides on the skin.\n\nMy cheeks and jaw line are perfectly smooth, my neck is still a bloody mess but I'm hoping to get it down soon. Otherwise, as beautiful as this razor is, I will have to cash in that 30 day guarantee.",

Cloudy, with a high near 31. Northeast wind 10 to 15 mph. Chance of precipitation is 70%. New ice accumulation of less than a 0.1 of an inch possible. New sleet accumulation of less than a half inch possible. High tide at 11:53 tonight.\n\nVery nice soap from Summer Break Soaps and /u/rocketk455. Underloaded on the dome shave just enough that I had to go back to the container for the face passes, Lathers up easily with not a lot of volume, which is nice because I'm not a fan of fluffy lathers. Slickness is very nice, but the residual slickness could be a bit better, as I wouldn't recommend going back over a spot without lather, but that might change once I get this soap more dialed in.\n\nThe scent is great. Off the puck I get mostly aquatic with a barely a hint of green. Lathered up I get more of the green but still mostly an aquatic scent. Scent strength is phenomenal, probably one of the more strong smells in my collection. Where the scent starts to really shine, to me, is the splash. While not intentional the first note that I get off the splash is alcohol, slowly followed by grass, and a bit of damp earth. It's almost like you are on your way out the field and the teachers that are staying in are popping the desk whiskey at 9 in the morning. Over all a very nice scent, that I look forward to using.\n\nUp early to take the train down to Boston for a birthday party this afternoon. Before that we are taking the Small One to the Children's Museum. I didn't realize until yesterday that it will probably be busy in the city this weekend due to the Boston Marathon being on Monday, so here's hoping to not being too crowded and/or getting too lost.\n\nHave a nice Sunday everyone!",

I was gearing up for shave like your grandad so I invested in a quart of Tabac aftershave, I'm not so sure, but it's not the worst thing to smell to go to bed to. Got a little to aggressive below my chin chasing that last bit of stubble, but happy overall with the shave.",

During the shave the scents receded and then came flowing back anew, several times. Very pleasant. Excellent shave (as WK has become so well known for).\n\nI finished with the Splash. To my nose the splash is a little less aquatic, and more rain /ozone forward. I left the bathroom with the distinct impression of a lightening storm over a body of water.\n\nThe original scent description:\n>*Straight from the throne of Zeus himself, comes Tempest, a mix of Ozone, Rain and Birch Tar. This is the how we imagine the air around the King of the Sky and Thunder smells like.\nImmerse yourself into the aquatic scent of the rain, walk through while the lightning strikes all around you, scorching the damp earth beneath your feet, and emerge smelling like the true King of the Gods.*\n\nI think /u/WhollyKaw and /u/Nex_Renegade really nailed the scent and vibe they were going for. Thanks for putting this together. And thanks to /u/chrisVanMeer for the very classy label art.\n\nHappy Sunday ya'll.",

Then last night I decided to pull the trigger on a Simpson brush that cost more than any other three items in my shaving collection combined. But I swear, as soon as the brush (and another soap/splash set I just couldn't pass up) comes in, I'm done shave shopping.

Been a while since I picked up the BBS-1 (gasp), and I forgot how magical it is paired with a polsilver. Also, grooming dept's duck fat base is among the top dogs, absolutely a top tier soap for me. Takes TONS of water and bypasses the woes of my extremely hard water. Kulfi is such a nice, warm and complex gourmand. I have no Post that relates, so I just used my favorite. Also, Phteven did a bang up job on this brush. I can't imagine the effort it took to sand and polish up the hive shape, but it looks and performs miraculous.

Today's choice was MLSW Cape Verde. I admit that I've been sleeping a bit on MLSW--probably because they've been relatively quiet with new releases and other such announcements. That's a real shame because I've had some of my best shaves ever using a MSLW soap. The base is still good even with a lot of the fancy bases that have been released over the past couple of years. It's super easy to lather, and the lather is incredibly protective in my experience. Really good stuff. Cape Verde is my favorite MLSW scent. It's more of a warm weather scent to me, but hey....it's supposed to be warm right now (even if it isn't). Happy Monday everyone!",

I love the scent of this cream but I struggle mightily trying to produce a sufficient lather. I thought I had enough product (smeared on my face), maybe I started with too wet of a brush, but I shook it out pretty good. Eventually I added more product but I feel like I had to use more than I needed to. Plus I have no proper post-shave that matches the scent.

I was gonna go with Nuavia Blu, but I've been looking more forward to using Impertinent and just hadn't yet. Ignorantly, I thought Impertinent was modeled after D&G Light Blue (it's actually D&G by D&G) and that the word was something like impervious or impenetrable or some other word that would give the CBJ the strength to not be beaten. Oh well, my sentiments must have been enough as they battled to another OT win and now come home with a 2-0 series lead. It's chilly today, chance of snow, I stayed up too late, but it could be worse I guess. Happy Monday.",

New precipitation amounts between 1 and 2 inches possible. High tide at 12:17 this afternoon.\n\nNice shave this morning. Did a much better job dialing in the lather today, and the residual slickness went up a few notches. Still felt that by the third application that I should have loaded a bit more. Might have to load this soap a bit more heavily. But it also might have been the brush, which I gave a cleaning with DG Brush Rejuvenator. So will have to see how it does on Wednesday.\n\nOur trip to Boston yesterday was a fun one.

My wife said it smelled like corn husks :( Too bad, she will have to deal because it's a keeper! Forgot how mild this Mamba is, no blade feel... couldn't draw blood if I tried, great noob razor, not the most efficient though. Had to do a bit of blade buffing to get smooth around the jaw line and I still feel some rough spots now.\n\nMy birthday was Friday so it was a great weekend. Went mattress shopping and picked one out that is getting delivered today, a Tempur-flex Supreme Breeze. I can't wait, never thought I would be excited about a mattress but our current mattress is at least 12 years old and feels like I'm sleeping in a hole. Always tossing and turning all night and waking up with back and neck pain. So here's hoping the new mattress gets me a good night sleep. And this is our first mattress purchase, we got our old mattress from a relative that was moving across the country and couldn't take it with them, holy hell are mattresses expensive.",

I am impressed with the shave quality. While I have no experience with 'real' Kamisori style razors, this one has been very easy to use. Maybe it's from my experience with other straight/shavettes, but this has been very intuitive. I'm very surprised at how well it shaves - one pass and touch up gives me a very close shave.\n\nThis was my first use of Stone Cottage soaps. A friend had sent me down a sample (it's their old base). I have to say that I was a bit underwhelmed by it. I had placed a jelly bean sized amount in my scuttle and used a wet boar brush. However, I never really seemed to have achieved a great lather with it. I'll try it again to see if it was a fluke or if the soap just doesn't perform as I'm used to.",

I guess I really could have gotten into it as soon as it arrived on Saturday... but Night Music seemed like more of a weekend scent and Tempest more of a power start to the week, so that's what I did.\n\nOff the puck, I got a lot of damp earth. When I started whipping up the lather, the rain and ozone crept in around the edges, almost like running a thunderstorm in reverse. This is my first Wholly Kaw soap and I was really impressed with the lather. Lots of glide and plenty of residual slickness between passes. As for the aftershave, I feel like the ozone has moved to the front with the damp earth in more of a supporting role.\n\nAll in all, it's a great way to start the week.",

It was also a good start to Wholly Kaw week, something I've wanted to do for a while. At this point in my shave journey, soap monogamy is not an option, even for a week, but I did want to use artisans for an extended period of time. So this was the comprise I made. Each week I'll go with one of my favorite artisans and just use their soaps exclusively.\nThe shave itself was great. All involved with Tempest did a wonderful job, and there is no need to talk about the excellence that is the Ass milk base. If I were to give it a shave score it would be a 98.89.

I should have quit and picked another soap when this lather didn't really come together, but I pressed on and eked out three passes using a thin watery sort-of lather. It wasn't the best, but looking back not the worst I have recently either. That must say something about the quality of this soap that even with a criminally small amount loaded I was still able to keep myself from being cut too much. Last day with this blade before moving on through my sample pack. Nothing huge to note, it performed admiralty in that I didn't really think about it too much in either V2 or V3A heads. It didn't have a rougher first shave like the Astra's I think had. Anyway onto GSB's next. I hope everyone has a great week, take care.",

Yea, me neither. Used an entirely new setup this morning and was pleasantly surprised by the results.\n\nThe mild tech head paired well with the sharpness of the feather, although a truly comfortable shave with this blade still evades me. Looking forward to using this soap a bit more as it performed well and smelled really nice. I'm thoroughly enjoying this trial and error phase of my shaving journey :)",

      "body": "\"Beside You\" SOTD\n\n**Song:** [Artist: Van Morrison. Song: Beside You](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ke27QakSPxM)\n\n**Prep:** glycerin soap, hot shower.\n\n**Brush:** [Stirling 24x51 mm synthetic] (https://www.stirlingsoap.com/collections/shave-brushes/products/synthetic-shave-brush-24mm-x-51mm)\n\n**Soap:** [Chiseled Face Summer ](https://trythatsoap.com/collection/34/?product_type=soap)\n\n**Razor:** [Stirling DE3P7S](https://www.stirlingsoap.com/collections/safety-razors/products/stainless-steel-handle-de-razor-de3p67)\n\n**Blade:** [Voskhod Teflon](http://www.tryablade.com/blade/voskhod-teflon-coated)\n\n**Post:** Extra lather, [Nivea Sensitive Balm](https://www.niveamenusa.com/products/sensitive-post-shave-balm), [CL Delor de Treget Toner](https://trythatsoap.com/collection/512/?product_type=toner)\n\n[Van Morrison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Morrison) is such a talented, enigmatic and mercurial performer with an amazing, soulful voice. I saw him perform back in highschool and he is still going strong 30-some years later. [Astral Weeks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astral_Weeks) was Van the Man's third studio album and such a departure from earlier, more pop-oriented albums. It is an amazing blend of folk, jazz and even classical music sung in Van's amazing soulful delivery. I have listened to this entire album so many times and heard so many nuances. [Beside You](https://genius.com/Van-morrison-beside-you-lyrics) is such a beautiful and hypnotic love song that is easily one of my all time favorite songs, and certainly my favorite Van song. It reads like a mystical stream of consciousness sung perhaps to a young child to let them know that you will always there. \"And you're high on your high-flying cloud | Wrapped up in your magic shroud as ecstasy surrounds you\"\n\nThe shave has me, seemingly in vain, trying to kill 1 soap by using it every other day. There is some progress, and I also like the fact that I am dialed in like a MOFO on the lather/water. Chiseled Face is so good and this scent goes with everything, so it checks all the boxes.\n\nOne point of notice is that after about 10 shaves using a few [Poliver](http://www.tryablade.com/blade/polsilver-super-iridium) blades I went back to the Vokshod. I didn't love it. Best advice I have gotten here is to periodically keep experimenting with blades even if you think you have settled on 1. I had thought I settled on the Vokshod but after using Polsilver, I placed an order for 100.\n\nPost shave, went with Nivea balm which is great and then the Delor splash which is such a great and unique scent and something you can wear almost any day without fear of offending or overpowering anyone.\n\nRainy Monday [Patriots Day](https://www.timeanddate.com/holidays/us/patriots-day), [Marathon](https://www.si.com/edge/2018/04/16/boston-marathon-live-results-runner-tracking-information), but no [Red Sox](https://www.boston.com/sports/boston-red-sox/2018/04/15/red-sox-announce-postponement-of-mondays-game). Have a great day!!!",

That's rare for where I am, so I decided to take advantage of that and use Leviathan, which I would normally relegate to colder months.\n\nThis stuff is fantastic. This truly solidified it as one of my favorites. I think it has one of the most distinct coffee notes in a \"beauty\" product that I've ever smelled.\n\nAlso, my first time with the Sharp Edge. We'll wait and see how the next couple shaves are, but so far it didn't wow me necessarily. Think I'm actually falling *back* in love with Feathers after trying out some of these other blades I missed out on in the past.\n\n**Song of choice:** [Peturbator - \"Sentient\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTN6cGmH2yM)\n\nBeen on an outrun kick for a very long time now. This song does not connect with this shave for me in any way, but I fucking *love* how smooth this song is. That change-up around 1:25 is just--uggghhhh--too good.",

Wanted to take today's post to finally say thanks to this subreddit (and wicked_edge) for getting me into the whole wetshaving thing. It's completely changed the way I approach grooming in general and my confidence and self-esteem over the past few months have skyrocketed because of it. I feel better in my own skin. I feel like maybe for the first time, I'm able to consistently present my best self.\n\nUnrelated to today's soap, but I wish to be on fire for people. To emanate gratitude and positivity. To acknowledge that every single person I meet is going through some type of battle. To be humbled that every single person I meet is smarter than me in regards to *something.*\n\nI've been genuinely happy over the past couple months and I think it's important for me to turn toward that feeling and to lean into it. I was downtown yesterday, standing on a corner of 16th street, waiting for a lightrail. I was listening to a great jazz album and the sun was out and I caught myself smiling like an idiot for no reason at all. Thank you.",

I've not really had my eye on CG for some reason, but I jumped at the oppotunity to give this a spin. It's a beautiful razor, and looks even better in person than it does in the pictures. The level 1 is mild, and I like mild razors. The first two passes were extremely smooth, and the razor is intuitive. The ATG pass was a bit rougher, but that might be due to needing to adjust my technique. Despite that, my face is smooth and happy.\n\nOverall, it's a great razor. I'll give it a few more uses before sending it on its way. Happy Tuesday everyone!",

This was the first go with the B5 and it's a winner, just like all the other Declaration brushes. I had Scott not brush the hair so as would be expected there were a few stray hairs that came out. However, I ran brush cleaner through the knot last night twice and then palm lathered it twice and that must have removed most if not all the louse hairs because there were none to be found this morning.\n\n36 this year, wow time seems to go quicker the older I get.",

Initial impression is that this is the softest batch of hair yet, but B2 has been shelved longest as I've mostly been going between B4 and B1 lately. I'm going to use a B2 next I think and see how that compares, and I'm wondering if it could be a 24mm vs 27mm issue. I've had two brooshes of 27mm and I found both of them to be too large for my tastes, but I'm thinking there's a chance this one is a keeper. I'll probably end up checking out 24mm B5 and compare the two. Anyway, phenomenal shave, really enjoyed the mildness of the Tech after using the NEW for about a week; Sherlock was so great as always. Tonight I'm thinking Leviathan - probably going to stick with winter smells as long as the weather keeps this crap up.",

Yesterday I was physically present at the office, but it was nearly a complete bust. I drove almost 800 miles on Sunday and didn't climb into my bed until about 3am and then was back up at 7am.\n\nI can say that the last 120 miles of the trip were some of the most challenging miles I've ever driven at any point in my life. It was super weird the whole time, with real fear and existential dread sprinkled in.\n\nYou have to understand at that point, I'd been behind the wheel physically driving for about 10 hours with stops about every 100 miles or so to let the old people walk around. So by the time I rolled into Durant, OK to make one final stop, there was no drug or chemical being sold at that particular truck stop that had the power to cure what ailed me. I was peeping all the assorted gas station [narcotics](https://assets3.thrillist.com/v1/image/1192831/size/tl-horizontal_main.jpg), but none had the juice I was itching for. Ten hours of driving plus another four hours or so stopped in assorted gas stations and rest stops -- all of this bookended with about six hours of restless, drunken hotel sleeping the previous day -- was taking its toll. Swapping out driving duties with my dad was [out of the question](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/8bxlbh/friday_sotd_thread_apr_13_2018/dxan6a5/), and he was likely the most competent option in the entire whip.\n\nSo I powered through.\n\nFor the entire day, the radio was locked onto [XM 40's Junction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tq4L4iLRqA&list=PLFsuraK4pkVb67nakuDI4BgfxY-yu63u8&index=53). I was slowly losing my mind one Glenn Miller track at a time. I don't know why, but Swing Era and Big Band hits from the 40s begin to take on a real horror show, creepy feel. The lo-fi sound, the weird transatlantic accent, the crooning, all the weird lyrics about finally turning 16 or whatever, I started to feel like I was in a Rob Zombie film.\n\nBut I would've gladly listened to 40's Junction for another 120 miles. Instead I got an even worse decade of horror -- 50s on 5.\n\nRock bottom happened during [Dion & the Belmonts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tL7QMM-Nt50). I was cold and clammy, heart palpitations, the air conditioner on full blast hitting me right in the face, fighting with every fiber of my being to keep the car between the lines, and to keep my eyes open.\n\n\"I can't go out like this\" I actually had the conscious thought.",

I do not love Maya. The scent is OK and I really appreciate the cacao notes, but it just didn't perform well. Little-to-no residual slickness and it left my face feeling dry and tight. I'll give it one more chance just in case I did something to screw up the lather (too much water? not enough water? moar boosters?)\n\nAlso, I'm just generally displeased because it's \"send a check to the government\" day. My dad always said that it's better to owe taxes than to get a refund because getting a refund means the government's been borrowing your money interest-free all year. I'm not sure I believe him. Getting a refund always felt good but I've owed for like 5 years in a row and cutting those checks is painful.",

The soap came together into a beautiful lather with not much effort and the cushion and post-shave slickness were top notch. I am not sure I am appreciating the finer points of the scent off the puck. From the soap I don't get much in the way of Birch Tar, and not as much Ozone but rather the lack of anything else. The aftershave was a little more forward and I did get the idea of a cool spring rain, in fact minutes after I splashed on this liquid, I stepped outside to a brisk cloudy day that still had a wet feeling, and breathing it in and feeling the wind did come together in a nice way. I also have to praise this new blade to me GSB did a wonderful job on its first time out. I look forward to a few more tries to see if it holds up as much as its reputation would suggest.",

I was chatting with a former tour buddy of mine about 1971 and how it was the Dead right on the precipice of what many consider their best era, the years 1972-1974. 1971 was a great year because [Pigpen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_%22Pigpen%22_McKernan) was still with them and going strong and [Keith Godchaux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keith_Godchaux) had joined and was rounding out the keyboard parts. Not Fade->GDTRFB->Not Fade was such a staple of this era and this version is such a muscular, danceable and trippy version it must be listened to to be believed. I especially like the call and response guitar that Jerry plays in the coda to Not Fade. \"I'm gonna tell you how it's gonna be | You're gonna give your love to me | I'm gonna love you night and day | You know our love will not fade away\"\n\nLove me some Coffee Spoons and I see this as a daily driver. So good\n\nPost shave, back on the CL balm and some more Spoons goodness.\n\nHave a great day!!",

I had received a sample of their Yuzu Kumquat soap a while back and put it into my drawer. Somehow in my sea of samples, I forgot about it. So, yesterday's reminder was my nudge to finally use it.\n\nThe soap is very soft and reminds me of the consistency of Declaration soaps. It loaded effortlessly and I had no trouble generating a thick, sour cream type of lather. The soap is fairly thirsty, but it wasn't difficult to get a slick lather.\n\nI have to say I was impressed by this soap. The scent is bright and citrusy, which is right up my alley. The performance is strong in all of the usual areas, slickess, cushion, residual slickess and post shave. I had no qualms with it at all. It gave me a very nice shave this morning. Red Panda did a great job with its initial soap offering.\n\nHappy Wednesday everyone!",

I developed Bell's Palsey over the weekend and the right half of my face has become paralyzed, so I've had to spend time dealing with that. Shaving, like many other things, takes on some interesting dimensions when you can't use the muscles in half of your face. It's basically the same process, but with a lot more off hand support for pulling and stretching things that normally just happen by using facial muscles.\n\nI have gotten off to a good start on wiping out this next tub though. I'm already nearing the point where I need to scrape out everything from the outer edges of the death ring and reform a new soap disc in the center of the tub. This was the soap I used for breaking in some boar brushes, so it has already seen a ton of lathers. I'm guessing there is somewhere between 20-30% of the original soap volume left at this point. If I had to guess right now, I'm thinking it has about 30-45 days left in it.\n\n\n\nHave a good one!",

I forgot how much I liked it. I love the scent, and like Cella, my only complaint is that I can't eat it.\n\nOn performance: before today I have used Bufflehead, WKDM and B&M reserve soaps (~3 shaves per soap, so 9 days of great soaps). I can say this: I didn't feel any shortage in terms of slickness, cushion or postshave today. I would say I get watery kind of slickness from Shanon's soap (similar to B&M Reserve, and based on 3 shaves Bufflehead as well), as opposed to the oily kind of slickness I feel while using WKDM, L&L(DG) or Grooming Dept(except Mallard) - if that makes any sense.\n\nFinally, after 13 tries, I am getting very good shaves with my Wolfman. Before this blade, I tried KAI (which is my goto blade in many razors) but found that to be a little less comfortable than I like. Then I tried Bolzano, and the shaves were really smooth, but I was wishing for something with a bit more bite. And with 2 shaves with these Wizamet blades, I think I can say this is it!",

The first thing I noticed is that this is *way* softer than Declaration's Original. It was as excellent as described, but I made the mistake of not loading enough which lead to a nick or two on the last pass.\n\nReserve Spice AS was really nice and I really liked the formula. I thought it helped my skin after the nick and a tiny spot or two of irritation.\n\nAnyway, I'm looking forward to writing up about Tempest soon. I used it last Saturday, but I'm holding out on a SOTD until the aftershave arrives for the full experience.",

Pulled out the Parker Variant after a while and cruised on setting 3. I usually switch to 2 on the ATG pass but was feeling lucky and kept it on 3. Definitely more blade feel but light pressure got me through with no issues. The Maseto silvertip brush produces so much lather so fast it's quite a sight, but it eats it up just as well so a quick squeeze of the brush helps. I thought spring had sprung but it's cold and dreary again here in the Bay Area. So, maybe menthol wasn't an awesome choice? eh, feels good anyways.",

Show: 1972-04-26(Jahrhunderthalle) Song: Bertha ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJ3xpTT7j4M)\n\n**Prep:** glycerin soap, hot shower.\n\n**Brush:** [Stirling 24x51 mm synthetic] (https://www.stirlingsoap.com/collections/shave-brushes/products/synthetic-shave-brush-24mm-x-51mm)\n\n**Soap:** [Wholly Kaw Tempest](https://trythatsoap.com/collection/929/?product_type=soap)\n\n**Razor:** [Stirling DE3P7S](https://www.stirlingsoap.com/collections/safety-razors/products/stainless-steel-handle-de-razor-de3p67)\n\n**Blade:** [Wilkinson Sword](http://www.tryablade.com/blade/wilkinson-sword-german-)\n\n**Post:** Extra lather, [CL Unscented Balm](https://chatillonlux.com/collections/post-shave-salve/products/unscented-post-shave-salve), [Wholly Kaw Tempest AS](https://trythatsoap.com/collection/929/?product_type=aftershave)\n\nMore [The Grateful Dead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead) today, this time I'm focusing on my alltime favorite year, 1972. This year is such a magical year for the Dead, with some amazing shows and tours. I'm starting with one of my favorite shows from their [Europe 72](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe_%2772) tour. The Dead toured Europe for 2 months playing 22 shows. They had always recorded their shows, but this tour in particular they were going to release a live album of some of the best songs from that tour, so the quality and quantity of live recordings is amazing. This show from the \"Hundred Year Hall\" in Germany is a scorcher shooting right out of the gate with Bertha. This song rocks and was a perennial fan favorite, especially as a show opener. This song always gets me going and today was no exception. \"Test me, test me | Why don't you arrest me? | Throw me in the jail house | Until the sun goes down\"\n\nMy first use of Tempest and I love it. I use Summer Storm from Chiseled Face every other day, and this is very similar scent profile. I have not shaved with WK that much, so my water ratio was off initially, but I was able to dial in pretty quickly. Love the scent, and the lather and protection is amazing.\n\nI also tried a new blade from a sampler I have and I do like the Wilkinson. Will keep trying different blades even when I get my 100-pack of Polsilvers.\n\nPost shave, back on the CL balm and then finished it off with more Tempest. I'm not a huge menthol fan and this has menthol listed as the 3rd ingredient so it is very up front. It is my first experience with WK aftershave and I would say that the menthol is probably a little high for my liking...maybe in August when the temperature is higher I will feel different, but it was very brisk and lit my face up a bit today.\n\nHave a great day!!",

So I drove to the station for a shower and shave before I got all purdied up in my blues.\n\nHad a really really great shave, everything just clicked. *Man from Mayfair* isn't my favorite WK scent, but it's subtle and relaxed. I often \"read\" while showing and shaving. Today I was listening to *The Book of the Five Rings* by Miyamoto Musashi.\n\nI was afraid that my novice hand at the strop might have finally been taken it's toll upon my Rodgers & Sons blade. But after a good stropping again this morning, it delivered another excellent shave. The keen edge persists.\n\nI got some odd looks in the station locker room when I started using a brush, soap and bowl with a DE. Those odd looks were replaced with incredulous looks today. My choice of shaving implement along with my penchant for audio books while grooming - well I think people are starting to talk...\n\nI'm writing this from the officer's waiting room at the court building. I was supposed to be on the stand 30 mins ago, but now I won't be on until at least 1130. Apparently one of the jurors was an hour late (I didn't know that was a thing either). When (if?) I finally get done here, it's off to real work.\n\nIt's going to be a long day. Have a good Wednesday ya'll.",

I decided to give my badger brush the day off and tried again to work with this very stiff Omega boar. Managed a marginal bowl lather and it lasted enough for three passes, but it didn't quite reach the most prime point initially. No big complaints about the razor and blade, I had a few nicks around the chin but not too painful and I am happy at the closeness overall. I am still much more a fan of this aftershave than the soap, I really like the cooling feeling I get on the face when stepping outside. Happy hump day, all.",

I got samples of their entire line, and I have to say, right off the puck, these smell *awful*. I know it's subjective and all, but no matter which one I smelled (Boreal, Maya, West Indies, etc.), there was this underlying burnt rubber tire smell. The *exact same scent* in every single one of them.\n\nSure, Boreal had that coniferous scent, West Indies was a semi Bay Rum and orange, got a little amber out of Himalaya, a little chocolate and coffee out of Maya, etc., but they were *all* underlined by this fresh burnt rubber smell like someone just peeled out of a driveway.\n\nIt's so hard to fully explain, but yeah, these did not work for me...\n\nThat being said, they whip up a [mean lather](https://i.imgur.com/bCNPliL.jpg). And yes, the lather did smell a little better to me than it did straight off the puck (more coniferous, less burnt rubber), but I still don't think I'm sold on their scents after this.\n\nAlso, side note: I keep my beard usually and just trim the neck and cheeks but work the lather into my beard anyway to keep it soft and smelling nice. Today, I was trying to trim the whole beard by using the 9 setting on my slim. I found that with a sharp blade in the 9 setting if I just lightly drag it across the top of my beard, it trims off *just* the right amount, as if I was using clippers with shears.\n\nToday I accidentally went too hard in one spot and ended up with a real obvious patch...so I ended up taking the whole thing off. I'm a babyface for the first time in years :(",

His mother, my Great Grandma, had gotten him a case of Old Spice soap a little before she passed away some 13 or so years ago. I don't know if he used this exclusively or would switch it up. Anyway, what's in the mug is what was left when he passed a few months ago. The box contains the last puck of that case. I'm actually quite surprised with the performance. The lather is a little foamy, but it has good slickness and a decent post shave, though I wouldn't go over a spot too much without lather. It would be nice if they still made this and sold it in stores.",

So, I went with my oldest razor, brush and the Aqua Velva was a request from the wife since her grandfather used it. The Double Ring is the oldest razor I own and is the original double edge razor invented by King Gillette in 1903. I purged off my vintage brushes quite some time ago when I fell in love with Declaration brushes, I thought it was only right to use the original batch. My wife bought me a bottle of Aqua Velva because her grandfather used it his entire life and the smell reminds her of him. Unlike me, she had a great relationship with her grandparents, I wish I would have met the man but I do have some of his old hand tools that I treasure. Makes the wife smile when she knows I'm using his stuff.\n",

Greaves & Sons 6/8\n**Post:** Lucky Tiger - Oil of Olay Complete\n\nIn keeping with the theme, I went with a big boar and WMS. I used one of my grandfather's two straights a few weeks ago and it was too dull to get a comfortable shave. I substituted my oldest razor instead. It logs in right at 200 years old. I honed this when I got it, but it needs a little more tuning. It still gave me a good shave, but I had to do more touch ups than usual. Speaking of touch ups, it did my final touch ups with only water and the residual slickness of the soap. Say what you want about WMS, but its slickness is objectively good. The quality of the lather overall is nowhere near most soaps, but the slickness is there. I used to use this every day. Hell, I used Ivory and no brush for 30 years. Definitely would not want to go back to either of those practices.\n\nOff to an interesting day.",

      "body": "Soap: Noble Otter Barrbarr\n\nBrush: Omega 40033\n\nRazor: Gillette Goodwill\n\nBlade: Perma Sharp\n\nPost: Lucky Tiger splash and balm\n\nI had to improvise for this SOTD because at least for as long as I can remember, my grandpa used a Norelco electric. I remember as a kid being fascinated even by the sound of his electric razor and thinking it was cool that he shaved with it. I suspect that he used a DE razor in his younger years, but I have no proof of that. I truly envy you guys that have a DE passed down from your grandfather, as I would love something to remember him by that I could use on occasion. So, this is more of a \"tribute to my grandpa\" shave.\n\nMy grandfather grew up in Detroit, and was a salt of the earth, old-school type. To me, he defines what it means to be one of the Greatest Generation having served his country in WW2 in the Air Force. After WW2, he settled down in Arizona where he was stationed. He was kind, funny, a hard worker, and to me looked like Johnny Cash--it doesn't get any cooler than that. He was known for his ability to fix anything, and was truly one of the best people I have met. As a kid, we'd work on projects together, and he loved to take me golfing and fishing with him. I'm incredibly fortunate to have had him in my life until his passing when I was 15, and I miss him every day.\n\nAs for the shave, I picked my most nostalgic scent--Barrbarr. Even though my grandpa shaved with an electric, this scent really does capture the essence of what an old-school barbershop would smell like, and I like to think that had I been around in his DE shaving days that he would have used something similar. The Omega was my most classic brush, and the Goodwill on loan from /u/Whiskyey was the obvious choice. I am also borrowing a Aristocrat that I could have used, but that didn't seem fitting as a tribute to my grandfather, who preferred a no-frills approach. I had a really great shave today, and I'm looking forward to seeing what you guys come up with for your own tributes.\n\n",

One died before I got in to wetshaving so I never got the chance to ask him. The other was alive until recently, and I once hit him up to see if he had any antique razors. He looked at me like I had three heads and asked me why the hell I would want antique razors when there are perfectly good electric razors to be had.\n\nThis doesn't surprise me. This grandfather was obsessed with technology. I think it was an outgrowth of growing up dirt poor in rural Italy, and then building a comfortable, middle class life for himself in America. He also saw his children go on to do very well, one of which (my uncle) going on to become downright rich.\n\nHe told me to go in to computers. In the early 90's he was telling me they were the wave of the future. I didn't listen to him and probably should have. He himself had no technical skills-he was a tailor-but he understood and appreciated the role of technology in our lives and didn't think you should do something yourself that technology could make better.\n\nThat said, I wasn't going to use an electric razor. So I used some old smelling stuff, and figured the story met the theme more than anything.\n\nEDIT: A word.",

Everything above belonged to my grandpa, with the exception of the blade and the knot in the brush. This is the second time I've busted out the Old Spice puck (lather games last year was the first). I lather from the bottom so I don't ruin the stamp on top. It's amazing that this soap not only performs well after all this time, but also still has a decent amount of scent. This is the first time I've used the aftershave. My grandma wrote 195- on the bottom of the mug so I assume at least the mug is that old. No idea about the soap and aftershave. Anyway fantastic shave. It was a lot of fun!",

I actually remember my grandpa only using a cartridge razor. Once I was watching him shave when I was about 5 years old. When he finished up he left the razor on the edge of the bathtub so naturally I gave it go and had my first shave ever. I had a good time but cut my ears since my grandpa shaved his ear lobes and I copied him. Fun!",

So, I decided I would channel several older relatives at once...I don't know all the gear they used, but I will piece together what I know and use some products from that era to fill in the gaps. 2 of my great uncles I know wet shaved and I will start with my grandfather's cousin who had 3 razors we found when he died: a Gem Micromatic OC (no...i used it once and based on the condition, i had the same reaction of \"holy crap that's terrifying\" that he did), a Gillette Red Tip (which my brother uses), and a [Cooper OC](https://www.badgerandblade.com/forum/reviews/cooper-open-comb-razor.211465/) which I can't seem to get blades to fit in as it had specialty ones back in the day. I know he used Wilkinson Sword Classic for the Gillette because we found a ton of them when he died. The brush he used was a vintage Ever Ready Badger and since I don't have any badgers in my collection, the Satin Tip is the closest thing (I am really more of a syn/boar type of person). As for soap, I have no idea what he used, but I know from a box in my great aunt's bathroom that my other great uncle (my grandmother's sister's husband) used Williams (and we all know about Williams so...subbed out Arko) and I KNOW from all the collector bottles of the stuff all over their bathroom that he used aqua velva exclusively in fact, I think him using it is half the reason I like the stuff. Well, off to work now. If someone knows how to get blades into the Cooper or has some blades for it, I would LOVE to give it a try.",

I ended up with 3 of his Fragrances: Blenheim Bouquet, some Joop!, and Acqua di Parma. I had to go with Blenheim today, as it was his \"daily wear,\" scent. It matches well with Old Spice, so hopefully the rest of my shift workers enjoy the nostalgia of today.\n",

Bay Rum is a perfect little waft of Americana. An iconic smell so engrained into the grooming history of North America, that a large majority of North American grooming companies that are producing shaving supplies, include their interpretation of that scent in their line ups. If you grew up in North America, there's a good chance your grandpa was acquainted with the smell of Bay Rum.\n\n\n\nHave a good one!",

He's been using [Gillette Good News disposable razors](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51ZUY-1AreL._SY355_.jpg) for as long as I can remember (which consequently, that's what my Dad uses to shave, and what I was taught to shave with as well). Last I saw, he was using shaving goo. I don't have any of those things, and even if I did I wouldn't use them.\n\nMy grandfather had his 90th birthday on Sunday. I celebrated his special day [by literally trying to avoid killing him in a fiery auto crash by way of a fit of Big Band-induced madness.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/8cuy54/tuesday_sotd_thread_apr_17_2018/dxid6pq/)\n\nMy grandfather has had his health scares this past year, and if I'm being honest, even 3 months ago it appeared he wouldn't make it to see his 90th birthday. If he were a cat, he'd easily have run through about 6 or 7 of his nine lives over the past 18 months. I'm always cognizant whenever I've seen him the last few years that this time may indeed be the very last time I see him. But despite all that ails him, he's not slipping at all in his mind. He is the same guy he was when I was a kid albeit much softer and quicker with hugs and I love you's.\n\nGoing back to his hometown and re-hearing all the old stories helped me to contextualize the way he is. He was hard on my dad and my uncle. He was hard on me as a young kid. His garage/workshop is and always has been a well-organized, but girthy tower of assorted junk -- meticulously organized, but a vast, decades-old collection of hardware, wires, obsolete electronics, salvaged parts from long-forgotten household items, a graveyard of push mowers, and tools on top of tools on top of tools. He throws nothing away. Hell, he has at least 5 sets of bald tires stashed up in the rafters.\n\nBut going back to his hometown and hearing him talk about his childhood -- stories I've heard before, but never really *heard* with grownup ears -- it all makes a lot of sense. Both of his parents were first generation Americans and didn't speak the language. My grandfather was the second youngest of 7 kids and five years old when his father was killed in a coal mining accident.\n\nSeven young kids with a mother who could read no English and was able to speak only a little bit trying to survive at the height of the Great Depression, why, it's no doubt he refused to throw anything away. Hell, you never know when you might need something. Of course he was hard, tough, and thrifty.\n\nHe's amazingly self-aware: \"I'm sorry I was so hard on you\" he says to my dad, \"I didn't have a dad, so I didn't know how to be one.\"\n\n\"All I knew was that it was my job to provide for you because I didn't want you to grow up the way I did.\"",

Thus, for today's Theme Thursday, I tried to go with hardware and software that's been around long enough for my grandfathers to have possibly shaved with.\n\nBoth of my grandfathers served in WW2. My maternal grandfather was a logistics officer in the Navy who (based on the scrap books) spent a fair amount of time typing up funny memos and taking higher-ups on tours of of places we'd captured after (most of) the fighting had stopped. After the war, he worked in the citrus industry in Florida. My paternal grandfather was an Army riflery instructor. He said once that it was hard to keep himself emotionally distant from the guys he was training, but he had to because he knew most of them would never make it home again. After the war, he went home to Kentucky and worked with his father great-granddaddy's building supply company.\n\nI grew up in the same small Kentucky town and was lucky enough to have both my grandfather and great-grandfather around until my sophomore year of high school. I'd love to be able to sit down and have a conversation with them now. I should probably take that as a cue to sit down and have a nice long conversation with my dad next time we visit.",

Because of that, I decided to go all in on Old Spice for today's theme. He also used a 3 piece Tech ( a ball end in the gold color, to be precise, as well as a Silver Super Speed that I personally have), and if this theme was a week later I would have been able to use that exact razor since my dad has the Tech and I have the Super Speed as my \"at home razor,\" and I'm moving back home from the dorms next Wednesday. C'est la vie, I suppose. Either way, I think I definitely nailed this theme, especially considering the fact that when I wore the vintage Old Spice on Easter, he commented that I smelled like him about 50 years ago.\n\n\nInstead of his actual razor, I used a 3 piece Tech that I picked up off of eBay a month or so ago, and it is the only razor I can get a comfortable shave with a Feather in. In fact, a Feather is the only blade I've found that I actually like in that Razor.",

It is apparent from the ingredient mix that Coat Tails is not like the others in Mohammad's lineup. It is a very soft soap, and some caution needs to be exercised when loading. Scent-wise, this is a vetiver and saffron forward scent, with oud in the background and a touch of clove. One can expect a less divisive scent compared to Amber Oud. As with other soaps in Mohammad's offering, Coat Tails has a high level of water tolerance. However, the lather texture in Coat Tails seems to be slightly heavier, and feels more protective as a consequence - I suspect that these qualities are due to the addition of coconut oil, an ingredient that is absent in his other soaps. On the flip side, coconut oil makes the post-shave a little more \"drying.\" Overall, I believe that Mohammad has paid very decent homage to the classic Italian soap formula, and I had a very enjoyable shave today.",

Few extra passes on the neck to get those last missed bits with no cuts. MWF lathered up great with the Omega just had to get that scrubbing motion in and the lather started to get all creamy.

This tour was epic on a number of levels...[Pigpen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_%22Pigpen%22_McKernan) was still with the band, though this would be his last real contribution to the band and [Keith Godchaux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keith_Godchaux) had seamlessly blended with the band, giving them such a full sound. Plus as previously mentioned, they were planning on releasing a live album from this tour, so the quality of recordings was fantastic. The slight downside in my mind is that because they were planning on putting these songs on an album, they tended to be shorter and tighter then other epic shows from this magical year. [Truckin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truckin%27) is a song that even most non-Deadheads know. It swings and swerves and can often be the launching pad for an epic 20+ minute jam. This version clocks in a little less, but still has all the makings for an awesome version. The main thing I love about it is how prominent the organ is in the mix. \"You're sick of hangin' around and you'd like to travel | Get tired of travelin' and you want to settle down. | I guess they can't revoke your soul for tryin' | Get out of the door and light out and look all around.\"\n\nFor the themed shave, I went with Proraso, which I love. I never knew either of my grand fathers, but I have a great picture of my mother's father with a kick-ass mustache. I wish I could grow such an epic stache, but my facial hair is more of a [gorilla mask](https://twitter.com/its_charlie_day/status/541964724410142720). I can imagine him using something like Proraso and feeling like a BOSS!\n\nPost shave, CL balm and then finished it off with more of my homemade Bay Rum which is no doubt something old grand pappy would have used.\n\nHave a great day!!",

For today's theme I ordered a jar of this classic soap, I left the matching AS at home so I had to make do with the remainder of a B&M Reserve Spice sample, which is fitting because this sent does really remind me of my grandfather. I was pleasantly surprised at the quality and ease of producing this lather, it performed great not as good post-shave feel as the usual artisans but I was happy to use it and I enjoyed the pretty powerful scent. GSB has treated me pretty well this week my favorite thus far out of the samples I have tried.",

Absolutely beautiful.\n\nThis is my first time with Cheshire and it's honestly amazing. I love that herbal-y tea scent and I think it's right up there with Leviathan as my favorite, and it's more versatile so I can probably use it more often than Leviathan!\n\nI've used Gillette Silver Blues in the past and remember only kind of liking them. I absolutely loved this blade in this shave, though. Since I've rekindled my love for Feathers lately, I might need to put a Feather head-to-head with this Blue soon.\n\nThe only thing about the soap, though, is that it was a tad drying. Since the label on my Groomatorium sample seems to suggest it's from the old base, does anyone know if the new Glissant type will be less drying, or will it be about the same?",

I took a small amount and hand-lathered without any issue. But the resulting shave with 2-day growth was the worst I've had in weeks. I thought it was my old blade but when I switched to a relatively new one nothing changed. So much tugging, I'll have to try growing the stubble out again and looking at my whole pre-shave.\n\nIt's Friday, bitches!\n",

I loaded for 12 seconds and had enough for 5 passes. I only did two. The Red Tip just isn't working out like I had hoped. I've only had maybe 2 good shaves out of it, so it must be more aggressive than I realized. I've got a Rockwell 6C on the way, so I'm hoping I find a sweet spot somewhere from its various base plates.\n\n[Catie's Bubbles Darkside SOTD](https://instagram.com/p/Bhwtz7tBZax/)",

Or, they'd add liquid drugstore glycerin to their lather. I forget which, but one of those things was called \"superlather\" and the other was dubbed \"uberlather\" as effing stupid as both of those terms sound.\n\nThe idea was to improve on your lather, by making it more slick or more moisturizing or to bring interesting smell combinations to the face-meat party. You have to understand that these were the days when Mama Bear was *the* \"artisan\" soap option (that is, if you consider pouring pre-mix fragrance oils into an off-the-shelf melt and pour soap base and hitting it with a stick blender something that could roughly be called an artisanal product) and the wetshaving market was dominated by traditional products (the British three T's, Tabac, Mitchell's Wool Fat, Arko, etc.).\n\nThose, my friends, we're the bad old days.\n\nThe point being that we live in times where you don't have to do anything to your artisan soaps to improve upon their performance or make them smell better. They worked through it already. Exhibit A: Santal Auster in goat base.\n\nPerfumery? On point. Performance? Peak. Slickness? Snot. Post? Nourishing.",

This was my first use of MdC and I followed their instructions - badger brush, warm water, build lather on face/neck.\n\nI was surprised to smell that the tub of unscented does, in fact, have a slight scent to it. I can't quite place it, but I'd say lavender. It's pleasant, don't get me wrong, but I was surprised that it has a scent (if you will). I've sniffed Maggards unscented soap and it had zero scent profile. Anyway, the performance was very nice. The lather built quickly and easily; I didn't have to load a huge amount on the badger tips to get a large amount. The ProGuard blade slid very well against the slick, dense soap. Overall, I see why people like MdC.\n\nSo how does it compare to WSP (sometimes called a MdC clone)? I found the MdC to load/lather easier than WSP. I'm a fan of WSP, I own several of their soaps. However, I would say that WSP is closer to PdP than MdC in terms of looks and performance.\n",

Then I got a .67 OC Stainless Steel. I passed both of those along after getting a .67 OC Bronze. Today was the first shave with a .74, and it was pretty great for a fifth and final shave of the week. I always worried the .74 would be too aggressive for my weekday shaving routine, but I think it might be the perfect balance of aggressive and efficient that actually gives a smoother, less irritated result.

I knew I wanted to have at least one of Barrister & Mann's Reserve soaps, and I was 99% sure I wanted it to be either Fern or Lavender. Go figure...*both* of these scents are fucking fantastic. I kind of like that they're simple and straightforward.\n\nI was hoping that testing them both out would help me make a decision, but it just made it worse. I can't decide now!\n\nThis was also my first time with the Merkur 37c and first time with a slant period. I (apparently) have very coarse and rough hair, so some people around here recommended I try a slant. The first couple passes with the 37c were just fuuuuucking perfect. I was 100% sold on this razor after those first couple passes.\n\nThen, I went for a last ATG pass, and.....oh boy.....that was some of the roughest shit I experienced in a while. So much pulling and nicks and weepers and irritation. It was just goddamn painful.\n\nI really don't know if that means I still need to work on my technique or if my beard is so coarse I just need to stay the hell away from ATG passes altogether!\n\nRegardless, I'm going to keep giving this 37c a shot. I *still* feel like it's tearing into my hair better than the Gillette Slim has been.\n\nFinally, I used Clubman Pinaud because I had nothing else to pair with these soaps. It's gross and it leaves me feeling dry as hell and I officially hate it. I've never been so happier to have the Stirling unscented balm than I did this morning.\n\nPS: if you've seen Annihilation, please check out the book. It's fucking weird and great.",

Today's soap was one gifted to me when buying a brush from a fellow redditor which I didn't really care for from the start, but it has grown on me the last couple times I have used it. The lather isn't quite up to the WK peak I hit earlier this week with my first time using GSB, but it was fine. It didn't feel as slick when I was using it, but turned out a very nice shave with zero irritation. Have a good weekend everyone!",

Also, using a Polsilver for the first time.\n\nThe soap scent is definitely milder than others, even after lathering. It was an awesome shave. It is a thirsty soap that produces rich lather like other high\\-quality soaps in the den \\(such as B&M Reserve and Declaration Grooming\\). The biggest difference, I noticed, was in the better post\\-shave feel. I agree with others that say that it felt like they didn't need to use any post\\-shave products.\n\nSplash was definitely stronger on the scent. It reminds me of a cough drop/throat lozenge. Menthol burn was INTENSE \\-\\- strongest I've ever felt \\(for comparison, have used Proraso Green and B&M Cool\\).\n\nOverall, performance is top notch. Even though I'm not 100% in love with the scent, I can live with it since I'm not crazy about any of the other current WK scents.",

I hope that the M plate works better for me.\n\nThe previous 2 weeks or so have been terrible shaves. Nicks, cuts, weepers, and small patches of hair that were missed.\n\nBut today? Man, the stars aligned or something. Fresh Personna blade, Progress on setting 3 (instead of 4 ^1/2). It was perfect. Happiest I've been in days haha.\n\nHave a great day guys!",

Decided to switch up the hardware a bit and make it a cold water shave, too. Took my time, and it was a good one.\n\nUsing the last Feather from my original Try-A-Blade order, the shave was good enough that I may move to Feathers exclusively after the last 25-30 of these GIllette 7 O'Clock SharpEdges are gone.

I think my dad may have used it when I was little when he shaved around his mutton chops (oh, yes he did), Until he just went full beard. I kind of like it.",

I'm a freak like that and don't like using new stuff. This hybrid has seen some use and I'm much more comfortable using this one as a daily driver. The shave is wonderful, mild but efficient and effortless.\n\nI think the soap has a day or two left, it's getting really hard to load because there just isn't much soap in the container. I've already reformed it to the middle twice and I may need to do it again just to use up the last little bit.\n\nOkay boys, off to the flea market. The weather is much better this week so I'm hoping for more vendors than last week.\n\nHave a great Sunday!!",

This soap was the one I most liked the scent of off the puck. I think the soap is more citrusy than the AS, but I like them both. I had a great lather and a wonderful shave.

I can't quite put my finger on it, but I love it. With the weather finally resembling Spring, I figured I'd try and match it. After skipping yesterday, this morning shave was fantastic. Great Sunday shaves to all. Edit: typing with cleavers",

I have had some good shaves with Stirling, but it doesn't get a lot of attention from me with all of the other things I have to choose from. That's too bad, and I should use it more. I had an extremely slick lather this morning. Someone recommend loading it like you hate it and then dumping a ton of water into the lather. I think that's the key. You have to load a TON of soap, which they make easy to do with the generous soap size and large containers. Doing it this way I had a dense, slick lather. A very nice shave this morning.

I now know about the Chubby \"wall of badger\" first hand. Going to have to load a bit more next time I use the brush as I had to squeeze it out to get any lather for my 3rd pass.\n\nVery happy with the Superspeed and glad I went with the flare tip rather than the 40's style. The flared tip makes it a little easier for my giant hands to handle since it is not a large or long-handled razor.\n\nAnd, as always, I love love love Jacinthe. I may have to grab another set next week when the 42 goes on sale. I would be very sad if it didn't come back next year (and apparently Will hasn't decided yet whether it will or not).\n\nedit: Just found the G1 date code on my razor, so I'm including it here for my own future reference.",

Per usual, tons of pulling and snagging, but this time instead of just grinning and bearing it, if I felt even a little resistance I just stopped and tried a different angle or just skipped over the area entirely.\n\nI had quite a decent amount of irritation by the end, but it wasn't as bad as I expected it to be in the bleeding department.\n\nFor an alcohol-free splash, that Elysium stuff burned! But I think it was just because my face was so irritated, not necessarily because of the splash itself. I've used the stuff before and it's usually pretty mild.\n\n**Shave song:** Floex's new collab with Tom Hodge and the Prague Radio Symphony Orchestra - [\"Wednesday (Is the New Friday)\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pePOsagq-9M)",

You put hot water in the large bowl and it keeps the lather and brush warm.\n\nReally loving the fat handle Tech. I've tried a 40's style Super Speed, a ball-end late 40's Tech, and one of those Chinese Futur clones. This one might be go-to. I was a little disappointed when I got it because I didn't realize the handle was hollow, and I thought it would be heavier. But, the balance is really nice when in actual use.\n\nI've had some of the best shaves of my life the past few weeks, thanks to digging into past threads on this sub. So far, so good, and there's no going back to cartridge razors.",

I remember MdC being super unimpressive for the price, but today I got one of the best shaves ever. It's still definitely lacking in post-shave slickness and feel, I definitely wouldn't shave over a spot that didn't have visible lather over it. Everything else is top notch though and the amount of lather this stuff generates is unreal. Have a good one, everyone!",

I like the scent of Soapmakers or Awesometown, it's just not a scent I absolutely love. The Feather razor isn't quite as aggressive as I like but it is always a smooth irritation free shave. Hope everyone has a great Monday!",

This show is a slow burn from start to finish that erupts into a fucking volcano at the end of the second act which I will reference below. The linked songs are a classic [China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China_Cat_Sunflower) -> [Rider](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Know_You_Rider) paring that the Dead performed throughout their entire career. The acid-drenched goodness of China Cat melding and dissolving completely into the classic Americana that is I Know You Rider. Such a great version and on an amazing tour. \"I wish I was a headlight, on a northbound train.\"\n\nFor extra credit today if your mind can handle it and you have an hour+ to spend, treat yourself to the [Darkstar->Sugar Magnolia->Caution] (https://archive.org/details/gd1972-04-17.sbd.ashley-field.34032.sbeok.flac16/gd1972-04-17d3t01.flac) from the same show. It is absolutely epic, showing the Dead at their height.\n\nFor the shave, back on the soap killing quest of Summer Storm. Seeing a bit more progress. CF is so good.\n\nPost shave, CL balm and then finished it off with Delor which has such a great, everyday scent.\n\nHave a great day!!",

This one was a scent that I liked but couldn't place directly until looking up the scent notes writing this note. I am not surprised to find that the citrus forward part is one that quite enjoy and there is more going on behind that first flush to make it an enjoyable addition to the stable. I don't think I quite had the lather dialed in great, this is a much softer soap than I am used to and I think I didn't get enough water into the initial pass, I kept adding more water each pass and it got progressively slicker and there was tons of lather left at the end after three full passes. It has outstanding post-shave feel, very luxurious and I did like the liniment. It reminded me more of the Chatty Lux salve than a normal balm. I look forward to more tries with this base and soap in the future.",

I felt like breaking out the Mühle and I wanted to try a new blade so I thought, why not both? I could have stopped after 2 passes, but I had a bit more to do on my neck so I just went for it. I was rewarded with an almost BBS shave with little irritation, just in my trouble spots and at that it was minimal. So far, I'm impressed with this Bolzano. As it was also Menthol Monday, I finished it up with some Aqua Velva.\n\nOn another note, I was officially made backup lead at work and given a key to the building. This means that I basically do what I've been doing, but I get a little better pay and I don't have to wait for someone to open the shop.",

I found especially that samples of B&M soaps really don't do the product justice. I definitely notice better performance when I use it in this form. Perhaps it's just so easy to under load when using a sample. Anyway, a terrific shave this morning. B&M gets much praise for their base and it's all deserved. One of the slickest soaps out there and the residual slickness especially I find to be amazing. Happy Tuesday everyone.",

Honestly, I'm not even sure I'll be able to load enough soap onto the brush with the amount remaining. I may need to just add whatever is left on top of whatever kill soap I pick for next, I'll decide tonight.\n\nThe razor selected for this shave was acquired through an oversea's trade. A pretty cool little piece of history that it was released prior to the #15 Aristocrat and was manufactured for the French Market. The previous owner nicknamed her \"The Dangle\" because of the French wording inside the case. Not sure if it was a requirement of the trade to keep the name, but changing it would be like changing the name of a pet after it was already named. It just doesn't seem right to me.",

It's over. I killed another soap. L'Occitane Cade cream was received as a gift last Valentine's Day from my wife. It was totally unexpected.\n\nThe cream itself has a very light scent. It smells clean, soapy, almost chemically. The cream itself is able to produce a very thick lather. I don't use many creams as TOBS was a starter (mmm sweet almond) and wasn't a great experience. Everyone says you only need a tiny bit of cream, like the size of a finger nail. Let me tell you boy, a 28mm B2 Declaration knot doesn't accept a finger nail size cream. The water hog thinned out the cream like none other and I probably had to use a crap ton of product just to get a good lather. But once it was dialed in, it wasn't too bad. Not up to par with some of the artisan soaps out there.\n\n**Would I buy again?** This will be my verdict for ongoing soap killings. I'd say this does not meet my standards as there are many other great products out there. The scent wasn't appealing. The price for the product is also off putting. No, I would not buy again.\n\nIf you like reading this mini review, smash dat like button and hit subscribe. See you next time.",

What an awesome scent and fantastic performance! The soap is very slick-- on par with B&M for me. It doesn't have quite the post-shave of B&M or Declaration, but isn't drying. I have liked this scent since the first time I used it, but it has really grown on me as I've worked through the sample, too.",

I've already set some leftover chili out to thaw. Maybe I'll run to the grocery store for either buns and hotdogs or Fritos, cheddar, and white onion.\n\nI believe the modern 8th anniversary gift is a Frito Pie, so that's probably what I'll go with because I'm a sucker for tradition and a hopless romantic.\n\nAnd just to add my special Love Day spin on things, I think I'll bake some dinosaur-shaped chicken nuggets and pop the cap on a few pouches of Kirkland applesauce. For dessert I was thinking of reading *Fancy Nancy* or *Madeline* stories to the kids and then dealing with the drama of bedtime with pleading, empty threats, and exasperation.\n\nAnd then perhaps a lady's choice of Fire Stick or Netflix to get the mood set. And from there, anything can happen.",

This one bit me a tiny bit, but nothing big. A tiny line yesterday, but it's gone today. Cedrat has such a narrow usage window for me, as the smell is quite citrus and summery, but I prefer alcohol splashes in warm weather. So basically it only gets used on spring days with cool nights. Perfect for yesterday's weather, and dealing with a little neck irritation from the harsh blade.",

There's too much patchouli after a few hours for my liking.\n\n\nAnd smelling it objectively, it's not *that* much. It's just that I have a bunch of stoner friends that drown themselves in cheap patchouli, as if reeking of patchouli is somehow less obvious than reeking of weed. So I'm inherently biased against it, regardless of how objectively good it smells.\n\nRegardless, I'm gonna need to hit /r/Shave_Bazaar and see if I can trade some soap samples for aftershave samples as this is the only one I have right now.\n\nSomewhat ironically, I also have a bottle of Chatillon Lux Y/R/P aftershave on its way right now, my decision based partially on the results of the recent soap tournament. I'm sure it's a great scent, and I'll probably wear it regardless of my own personal delusions.",

So I purchased this set based on this set being a Polo Black dupe. To my nose, it doesn't smell like PB what so ever lol. I thought that as the aftershave was drying, that it seemed to be picking up some of those PB vibes but it never quite got there. Kind of disappointed with that. Soap is extremely light scented (maybe like a 3/10) and the aftershave was probably around a ~7/10. The soap for being $8.99 before shipping hits super high for its value. $8.99 is Razorock level prices for soap and everyone knows those soaps are trash. Would I recommend it? Yes, but don't expect PB from this scent. This stuff hits way up its price point #BlessedForLess. I also picked up Coastal from Stubble Buster as well and I really dig the scent on that (never smelled Shambala from Folsom & Co.).",

And I agree, I get that vibe as well. The scent description says \"oakmoss and vetiver with a touch of myrrh in the base, with some sweet dried tobacco and a little tangerine and soft floral accord\". I am glad that the myrrh is not noticeable as I am not fond of it. I wish there was an Aftershave based on this scent. This can be actually be classified as a Barbershop scent, I think. At least I prefer it over Mystic Water's barbershop.",

The Academy of Music was rebranded as the [Palladium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palladium_(New_York_City\\)) in 1985, but before then was an old opera house used for many great concerts. The Dead played 5 shows there in late March, and IMHO this is the best of the run. It shows the Dead in a very loose, laid-back state as they gear up for the Europe tour the following month.No epic, mind-melting jams, just the good old Grateful Dead. I highlighted a great [Pigpen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_%22Pigpen%22_McKernan) tune from this show. Pig had slowed way down from his epic 30+ minute offerings of Lovelight or Good Lovin' from 1967-1970 which was really the height of the Pigpen era. This is a good-timey, toe-tapping song that sizzles from start to finish. I will highlight some additional Pigpen from later in 1972 in a future installment, but for today...\"I can hear the drums, voodoo all night long | Mister Charlie tells me I can't do nothing wrong.\"\n\nFor the shave, I followed up yesterday's aquatic number with another similar scent. I absolutely love the scent, protection, slickness of WK but I still have trouble with the water ratio. I would characterize it as \"middle of the road\" in terms of water, thirstier than Chiseled Face, not as thirsty as B&M Reserve.\n\nPost shave, CL balm and then more Tempest...too much menthol for me so I will go much lighter on amount that I apply going forward.\n\nHave a great day!!",

I'm not 100% sure if this is technically a triple milled soap, but it sure acted like one. This was probably the first puck I ever bought after I got rid of my Van Der Hagen soap from about 7 years back. So it has lasted me quite a while and in the end, it put a great fight.\n\nThe ring of death kept getting bigger, but it just never seemed to get a great shave in it's last few months. That is until I scraped the ring into a little mound in the middle of the tub, then I was getting much better shaves and didn't have to load as long.\n\nThis last shave was a bit disastrous as the soap was no longer keeping its shape. I ended up with tiny chunks of soap on my face and even more tiny chunks on my brush and tub. Since there was so much lather on the tub, I didn't think I had killed it, but after a quick rinse off with water, there was nothing but a handful of flecks left behind.\n\nRIP",

My wife spent close to a month working on fixing and painting things. We moved in on April 14th and the Internet was supposed to be installed the day before. They couldn't install the internet because they didn't know that the connection they needed for cable was in our neighbors yard (supposed to be in an easement). I knocked on their door and asked if they could go in their yard and it would have been fine if the installer hadn't just left in his truck. So they had to come back on Monday and do it while their dog was not in the yard.\n\nRight after we moved in, it was time to organize my work tasks before I left and pack for our honeymoon. We were in Costa Rica for a week and it was pretty amazing.\n\nOf course, I managed to bruise the crap out of one of my toes when we got back home.\n\nI'm getting back in the swing of things and work is going amazingly well.\n\nIt's also gotten warm enough for all the summer scents. It's been over 80 here pretty regularly since we got back.",

Shave went well, tried harder not to overload and got a decent lather but I had to work it quite a bit to get it to that state. Still need to work on my technique and it likely doesn't help that I keep switching between brushes. This blade worked great in this OC head, very effortless beard reduction on the first couple passes and for once didn't try too hard on the third, but was happy overall and was left with less irritation. This scent is wonderful, I really do dig the sweeter fruity scents and this one delivers in spades, I thought the splash had more of a guava note than anything else, but again as I looked up the scent notes my nose/brain is way off from everyone else. No worries, I like this soap very much and super happy with the performance especially the post-shave.",

It's a menthol and eucalyptus soap, and it's sort of reminiscent of vaporub but not as harsh. It's just a very refreshing soap. I like it a lot. I'm still impressed by the Noble Otter performance every time I use it. Very slick and the post shave is fantastic. I enjoy their soaps a lot.\n\nI also picked up a sample of Clubman Classic Vanilla recently. I didn't care much for the original Clubman, but the vanilla is toned down and smells more like a cologne. It's pretty good stuff that would make a nice all around scent. Happy Wednesday everyone!",

I will say overloading is much easier to work with than underloading.\n\nHave a good one.\n",

Still think this Mamba is just too mild, hard to get a bbs shave with it without a lot of blade buffing. On the other-hand I don't think I could nick myself if I tried. Might be good to keep around just to train my kids with when they get old enough to start shaving.\n\nLast run with this Astra SP, put in a Gillette 7 o'clock supersharp (yellow) for next time.",

The Kraken balm seemed like a logical scent choice, although the scent on the balm is not as strong as other balms I've used. Have a great shave today!",

Today's shave was fairly nice, I didn't end up with the best lather trying to whip up in a bowl with this still stiff boar. I think I didn't load enough today as even after adding plenty of water the lather was pretty thin and bubbly. I definitely need more practice. But that being said it protected my face just fine as I mowed down stubble, it just wasn't as luxurious as I had gotten from DG in the previous days. I did a Thayer's splash before the aftershave, and the cucumber was a pleasant complement. I really felt the menthol of the aftershave today (maybe that indicates I was a little rougher than yesterday) but it was a very nice cooling sensation that lasted for several minutes.",

This base is one of only four that I have that I actually forget to put on moisturizer after shaving. No shit. I forgot today as a matter of fact and went back to the bathroom to apply it.\n\nStropping matters. I finished my first pass and was not pleased with how the shave was going. I realized I forgot to strop the razor so I cleaned the blade off and stropped it mid shave. Huge improvement.\n\nThis is the week that won't end.",

See around here if you don't start your tomato seeds indoors and get some good growth going on before transplanting outside you will never have fully ripe tomato's before the end of the growing season. Frost date is Memorial Day so we have a few more weeks of cold nights before it's safe to plant outdoors. Lots of tomatoes will be grown this year as I have to make and can lots of sauce. Maybe I'll use this as my kill soap to see if I can finish it off before I pick the first ripe one of the season.",

Oh well, I'll make up for it tonight and just post tomorrow *shrug*. So SV isn't as good as I remember it. I'm a big fan of this scent though, and I had long waited for SV to come out in a scent I liked so that I could own it again. It's funny as I was shaving Ruds posted a review of SV 70th Anniversary - and I gotta say I agree with the comparisons to Dr. Jon's and Black Ship (both happening to be vegan as well), with it being probably closer to Black Ship or older LASSCo. I thought the post shave would come in and steal the show, leaving me with the absolutely luxurious shave experience I remember from the last time I used SV - which was before all the best (imo) bases came out (WKDM, B&M Reserve, DG Bison & Icarus). I'm going to keep it around for another shave or two to see if maybe I just didn't dial it in properly. The scent is probably worth keeping it for by itself, but I really don't like to be anything but pampered while shaving so I would probably ditch it. Happy Thursday everyone, the weekend is nigh!",

I surely have a large enough sample size at this point where I can start to draw some conclusions.\n\nUpvotes are just hard to come by in this community. A typical SOTD thread will have 100 posts, but with the top post having maybe 12 upvotes and a large swath of posts having 2 to 5 points (sidenote: have you ever noticed a post of yours sitting at +2 like all day? That upvote was from your boy. You're welcome, my guy.)\n\nAnd because PIFs and contests nearly always have minimum requirements of karma, receiving those thumbs up have actual, real life utility.\n\nSome of my SOTDs got updoots at a good clip, and I've also had some posts that were only at the top of the page if you sorted by controversial. Plus, I've seen the posts of success and failure as an observer.\n\nFirst of all, you're nearly always gonna find yourself swimming in the dopest of 'doots on a life event day: birthdays, wedding day, birth of a child, another year of sobriety, that type of shit.\n\nSecond, a fairly predictable template for SOTD success is when tragedy strikes: a death in the family, car wreck, destruction of personal property. /r/wetshaving may be a group of salty shitheels, but we're not completely devoid of compassion, my dude.\n\nAnother type of post can give you a puncher's chance at the top spot of the day: an in-depth review of a shaving item from your rig on that day. This path is not without its dangers though. Too glowing a review? Down arrow just got mashed. A negative review of a house favorite? Your internet points just got tooken, son.\n\nAnother path to success is to be funny, though not altogether crass. For instance, a fart joke/mild sexual reference/bordering-on-blue comparison should do well, but you could be punished for getting too deep in the gross weeds. For instance, I've had some PG/PG-13 rated extended, meandering anologies do well, while my true-life account of accidentally happening upon a middle-aged Republican dude playing the skin flute of my college buddy got slammed with downvotes. So keep your head on a swivel if you're trying to be amusing. It could go either way.\n\nAnother predictable pattern to the top is simply to shit on Phoenix Artisan Accouterments. The converse holds as well -- you want to find your post at the bottom, unironically use PAA products or, God forbid, post a positive review about it.\n\nHope this helps. Good luck and see you at the top (at least on your birthday).\n",

When I use this soap I get the impression of walking through a wood. The damp forest floor quieted from the rain. The rain drops softly *pat pat pat pat* as they drip steadily from the leaves high above. It's overcast this morning, so it even looks the part outside.\n\nReally nice shave today. The wedge shaves very different from my hollow ground razors. Not better or worse, but definitely has it's own character.\n\nHappy Thursday ya'll.",

Like him, I also prefer a mild razor most of the time so I'm hoping this exercise will be helpful for him. I loaded both razors with a new Voskhod blade, which I've been using a lot lately, and shaved my right side with the Rex and my left with the Tech.\n\nI don't have a Rockwell to compare the Rex to, so I chose the Tech because I feel like it sets the standard for mild razors. IIRC, I've heard people say that the R2 plate most closely compares to the Tech. I turned the Rex all the way down, which actually leaves the indicator just below the 1 mark. Just eyeballing the profiles, the blade gaps look similar.\n\nThe first pass, wtg, felt very much alike but the Rex left a little more stubble behind than the Tech. This could just be attributed to the fact that I haven't used the Rex nearly as much as the various Techs I own and needed a minute to get the angle just right.\n\nBoth razors provided a comfortable xtg pass, but the final atg pass is where they showed the biggest difference. I'm always careful when going atg; for me, most razors will tug and pull at the remaining whiskers and powering through it results in irritation. The Tech was a little bit tuggy; not bad at all, just telling me I needed to be careful with my technique to avoid irritation. On the other hand, the Rex remained smooth and comfortable providing a much more effortless final pass.\n\nThe end results were nearly identical; I can't tell a difference by feeling one side of my face vs the other. Nearly BBS and no signs of irritation. While the Rex was a little more comfortable going atg, overall I feel like both were very similar and closely comparable in terms of efficiency and blade feel (very little to none).\n\nI must add that the Rex won't unseat my Karve Christopher Bradley, which has nearly become a daily driver for me with the A plate. While the Rex is comfortable, I find the Karve to be almost totally effortless, the type of razor I could use half-asleep (... or drunk) and get an awesome shave. I also prefer the look and feel of the Karve; the Rex is downright heavy. I do like the true adjustability of the Rex and find it to be very effective at comfortably removing a week's worth of growth from my head after dialing it up.\n\nWow, this ended up being longer than intended, but hopefully this will be helpful for Joey and anyone else who might be considering the Rex Ambassador.",

Also as they have always done, they will seamlessly segue one epic tune into another, and that was the case today. One other thing you will notice about all of my remaining posts, they are all after [Europe 72](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe_%2772). The Dead came back from Europe with such a vengeance and with such a need to really stretch things out. As previously mentioned, they were recording for an album in Europe, so the songs are somewhat more abbreviated than normal. Post-Europe, they soar and this show is one example. The songs I have highlighted are a perfect microcosm of an [LSD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysergic_acid_diethylamide) trip. It starts with the euphoria and breakneck rush of Truckin, dissolves into the mind-bending hidden-reality of Dark Star and then lands you squarely back on terra firma with the life affirming Comes a Time. I have listened to this show and this specific sequence so many times and I always experience something new. \"Dark Star crashes, pouring its light into ashes | Reason tatters, the forces tear us from the axis.\"\n\nFor the theme shave, I had no choice but Mayflower. I have not used L&L much recently and was very pleased with the performance. It reminds me so much of Storybook Soapworks which I have been using quite a bit of. It is soft and creamy and takes almost no effort to whip up into an amazing lather. If you are struggling with getting a great lather and feeling somewhat inferior when you see some of the lather porn posted here, try some L&L or Storybook...you can thank me later. Mayflower is such a fragrant scent, but it is not \"flowery\" in the cloying, sharp sense of the word. It is sweet and fragrant and smells like a nice stroll through an English garden that is in full bloom.\n\nPost shave, CL balm and then more Mayflower which really extends the floral scent. My advice is if you have lots of meetings or will be in a closed space (like a car for example) with people, either skip the aftershave, or go very light. I put it on 4 hours ago and I am not noticing an appreciable diminishing of the scent. It also has just a touch of menthol as that is listed as the 8th ingredient in the list, so it just gives a touch of coolness.\n\nHave a great day!!",

The tips are whiter than usual and after just two uses the tips may be starting to curl. The backbone is fantastic but the density and tip softness combination is just heavenly. Seriously, if you get chance to try this knot, go for it.\n\nB&M performance goes without saying as does the L'Occitane balm. The Royal Water is a very regal fragrance.

It's good that we're heading down, because I'm nearly out of my Gillette Silver Blues from my sampler pack, and I definitely need more. I also have to say, it's nice having a girlfriend who loves the more \"out there\" scents like Roam.

Henckels 11/16 QH\n**Post:** Fine Lavender AS - Castle Forbes Lavender Balm\n\nCastle Forbes Lavender is a nice way to cap off a shitty week. This is a nice cream to use. The scent is excellent. And it takes very little product to shave with. I tend to overload this and end up with a mess. All said and done though, as good as this cream is, I think Cade Rich edges it out slightly in terms of slickness and post shave. But Cade doesn't even come close to Castle Forbes in terms of scent.",

It arrived yesterday so it had to be used in my SOTE. I can say without a doubt Noble Otter is making some excellent soap. Great creamy slickness and post shave with the BarrBarr scent being very pleasant. It paired really well with Fern Concerto.\n\nMy choice of blade was purely random and my first time using a Vijay blade. Decent enough shave from it, but not as smooth as my go-to blades: Polsilver & Personna Lab Blue.\n\nHave a great Friday fellas!",

I was a bit tired, so I picked up my 39c this time just to give myself a quick shave.\n\nI chose CF lime because the weather hasn't been very spring like and I wanted something that made me feel like the islands; I finished it off with a small dab of Pinaud Lime AS. I had picked up a sample of the Pinaud from Maggards - I have been looking for an inexpensive lime AS. I was happy with the smell and performance of it.\n\nOverall, it was a nice quick shave with no issues.",

I'm not going back. I have no desire to use a ~~SR~~ safety razor. My poor neglected 6c. But I enjoy the SR too much. /u/Roctraitor, /u/Old_Hiker, /u/Uhgly, I concede. You've won. I'll join your cult.\n\nThank you to /u/Hyvasuomi79 for the sample of SMN. A very expensive soap that I would never have bought /tried on my own. It was outstanding stuff. The eucalyptus was pleasant, but somehow didn't smell like I was shaving with Vicks. Very very pleasant scent, well outside my usual range of \"leather, dirt, gun powder, tobacco, F-you Imma Man, man!\" type scents.\n\nI'm glad today's shave was so good. Getting quotes this afternoon for an entire backyard landscaping project. From the ground up, so to speak. We have dirt, nothing else. So I'm gonna go ahead and start drinking...now.\n\nHappy Friday ya'll.\n\nEdit: werds r hardd. Fixed.",

The smell kind of reminds me of Aqua Velva a little bit, but having never smelled the Floid Blue I cannot comment on how close the scent is to the original. The splash is very refreshing with a nice menthol cooling sensation. It's a very nice splash that would pair well with almost anything, just a cool, crisp, pleasant smell. The bottle is huge and should last a very long time.",

It's probably my favorite in my collection due to the pillowy softness and incredible density. It's just so luxurious.

I can confirm shavettes are not for me. Straights are so much smoother and easier to use. This thing just doesn't agree with my skin. Way too harsh. Four weepers is four too many.\n\nI can't remember the last time I used this soap. It's still a pretty good soap. It is not as drying on my face as some of the soaps that I use more often. I bought this tub a few years ago when they were filled with 6 ounces in white tubs. That gives you an idea how old this is. I need to put this tub in a more visible area so I'll be likely to use it more.",

It wasn't as slick as I had wanted but even with my mistake, the overall protection and post shave feel was great. I expect the shave to be even better when I figure out the lathering.",

They bill it as their aggressive head but I found it to be more pleasant than the V3. I will use this one for the next few months and see if that holds true.\n\nSummer Storm today, this soap is probably in my top 3. Out of my 20+ tubs, this is the only one I find myself using at least once a week and will probably be the first tub I actually finish. The rain note on this is just perfect.",

I've always used a natural brush, and was doing everything the exact same way with the synthetic. This was giving me a poor quality lather and it just wasn't a good shave, leaving my face irritated and me frustrated.\n\n\n\nToday I loaded with a dry brush and a damp puck and then lathered, adding drops of water as needed. It gave me the single best lather I've ever had. It was consistent throughout the shave - slick, protective, and all around awesome. Because of how good the lather was, I ended up with the best shave I've ever had. No irritation at all over three passes. I'm honestly simply astounded how good it was. The synthetic has definitely earned it's home in my collection and might have supplanted the Simpson Berkeley has my daily brush.\n\n\n\nI am so happy with this SOTD. Seville is (of course) awesome, and even better as a full puck with the AS Splash versus the sample I had used before, the new brush is fantastic now that I'm using it right, and the GSB remains the best blade I've ever used.\n",

I've been using my Stirling synthetic for a while and I love that brush too. It's kind of funny, every time I use Proraso White soap, I say to myself \"It's not the slickest and creamiest soap out there, but damn if it doesn't matter.\" It feels too good with the menthol and especially if you use the preshave, the blade whispers across the skin. And it's not like it's not that slick. It's plenty slick enough, but I feel I've spoiled myself with Stirling, T&S, WK, etc., which Proraso just won't be as slick as. Plus I love the scent of the White line. A fantastic shave.",

I got this aftershave, then soap/splash from B&M, LASSCO, and Chiseled Face. I realized later that I forgot Caties Bubbles Barnegat Bay but I can get that later. I also think the next time I order from Stirling to get a sample puck of theirs. Having used the Clubman, I think I'm going to like this.\n\n[Pic of the samples](https://i.imgur.com/OeUihIX.jpg)",

      "body": "**Pre:** Shower and hot black coffee (Keurig because I didn't have time for Moka Pot or French Press...)\n\n**Razors:** Rockwell 6S (4), Merkur 37c, Gillette Slim (mostly on 7 and 9)\n\n**Blades:** Astra SP\n\n**Brush:** Yaqi silvertip\n\n**Soap:** Storybook's Coffee Spoons\n\n**Post:** B&M Leviathan splash / Stirling Unscented balm\n\nThis was my final time testing all three of these razors out simultaneously. This was probably the best shave I've gotten out of the Rockwell 6S, but I don't know, it's still harsh and rough. Not a fan. The 37c is still smooth, clean and efficient. I love that thing. The Gillette Slim is not quite as smooth or clean as the 37c, but it definitely holds its own and I still like it a lot. It's also fun to have a true adjustable, although I'm interested in trying out a Fatboy as well.\n\nCoffee Spoons was from a sample a Redditor generously sent me. Not quite a fan of it. It whips up an excellent lather, which I knew would be the case after trying Elysium, but the scent is just *barely* coffee to my nose. The best way I can describe it is rather than smelling fresh coffee straight from your cup, it's like throwing the coffee on a piece of paper, letting it sit for a minute, and then smelling the paper.",

The last batch was almost 11 months ago and has sat in a drawer since then. Partially as stability testing, partially because I just use what's open on the counter (Declaration Darkfall) unless Im in the mood for something specific.\n\nI'm pretty happy with this version, which is a \"vegetarian\" base with goat milk and without lanolin. Why no lanolin? Because I like a challenge and at this point, I'm a bit of a masochist. Lanolin is so absurdly good as an ingredient for post-shave, it's not fair. The only things I've seen that come close are pine tar which has an unacceptably strong scent for use in a soap base and unrefined soy lecithin (which is unstable in soap and smells like dead fish after a week or so). I don't think I quite hit that mark with the cocktail of things I used here, but it's not bad either! I'm pretty happy with the shave quality too. It's creamy and has great slickness.",

Cloudy, with a high near 50. Southwest wind 5 to 10 mph becoming southeast in the afternoon. New precipitation amounts of less than a tenth of an inch possible. High tide at 12:29 this afternoon.\n\nGreat shave this morning. Stuck with hardware that is tried and tested because I finally decided to pull out the APR-SAS which I have had since my birthday in January. /u/ntownuser makes fantastic products. This soap lathered up intuitively. This scent makes me wish that I actually wore business attire for either of my jobs because that's what this scent is telling me I should wear when I use SAS.\n\nThe lather was very intuitive to get just to the right level, and provided great cushion and slickness. The post shave was also very nice, not quite up to Cade standards, but then again, few are. But for me, it would have to tie with Barrister & Mann for post shave, just a bit behind WKDM.\n\nThe splash is a bit odd to get use to. It goes on a bit greasy, like a thinner version of Scale Polish, but that greasy feeling stays for a bit longer than Scale Polish would. It does get absorbed, and it makes my face happy. One of the reasons I have put off using this is because o the menthol in the splash. And it is definitely noticable, which I would put above Scale Polish, and right around where B&M Adagio sits.\n\nOverall I will more than likely trying to pick up some more of APR's scents.\n\nHave a great Monday everyone!",

The SS base is a bit tricky due to its extremely soft texture. It almost loads like a cream for me, and I have to be very careful not to overload. It's also thirsty, which increases the difficulty. But, with patience you are rewarded with a very slick, dense and protective lather. For how good it is I think it deserves more attention. I really like the scent on this too. It's a very smooth lavender, with just a touch of peppermint. It would be easy to overdo the mint, but SS has executed it perfectly. The Fine AS was the perfect compliment to the soap as well. A fantastic way to start my Monday.",

Yesterday I got another sample from him, Barrbarr Edp.\n\nHoly fuck I could wear this everyday, and probably will for at least a week or two. My favorite barbershop, can't wait to get it in the new base since I gifted my other set away.\n\nAnd this new base is nothing to laugh at, better than B&M for me. Lathers easy even with my hard water, provides a fantastic shave and post shave, it requires no post shave but I love the stronger scent on splashes and the tingling so I apply them anyways.\n\nEnjoy the rest of your day!\n",

Now that I've figured out how to use the synthetic, it's giving me better lather than I've ever had before. My Spanish Leather is a decant from my Dad's 500ml bottle, and smells absolutely awesome with the Lavanille. I actually have it in an empty aftershave bottle graciously given to me while I was at Maggard Razors. (Thanks again, /u/undream22!)\n\n\n\nAnyway, happy Monday everyone!\n\n\n",

I love that this amazing theater is still in operation and if/when I visit St. Louis I will make sure to check it out. This version of Birdsong soars and weaves. Later in the Dead's career it was more of a subdued show opener, but in 1972 this song took us to the highest heights. Birdsong is a tribute to [Janis Joplin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janis_Joplin) whose life was cut short in 1970. This is one of my favorite versions and got me going on this early Monday AM. \"All I know is something like a bird within her sang\"\n\nExtra Credit: Same show, the [Dark Star>](https://archive.org/details/gd1972-10-18.139725.sbd.miller.sirmick.remaster.flac16/gd1972-10-18s2t03.flac) [Morning Dew>](https://archive.org/details/gd1972-10-18.139725.sbd.miller.sirmick.remaster.flac16/gd1972-10-18s2t04.flac) [Playing in the Band](https://archive.org/details/gd1972-10-18.139725.sbd.miller.sirmick.remaster.flac16/gd1972-10-18s2t05.flac) is a mind bending sequence. If you have 45 minutes or so, put this on!\n\nFor the shave, back on the every other shave with Summer Storm. Love it, great protection, making some progress on the kill.\n\nPost shave, CL balm and then more some of my homemade Bay Rum. DIY Bay Rum is totally the way to go as you can tweak it to include or exclude some of your favorite scents.\n\nHave a great day!!",

Unfortunately, all that time sitting unused, the battery drained and was dead. Luckily, I was able to charge it and it seems to be holding a charge now.\n\nThis happened all the while we were boxing and getting ready to moved. Saturday and Sunday were spent moving boxes and appliances. Sunday morning we were able to buy a new, much needed car. After that whole ordeal, we went back to finish moving more things. After we moved out, we spent the rest of the afternoon cleaning.\n\nMonday shows up and I'm at work.\n\nI'm exhausted.",
