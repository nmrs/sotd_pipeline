North wind 5 to 10 mph becoming southeast in the afternoon. High tide at 1:18 this afternoon.\n\nAnd we are all back into one thread, like it should be.\n\nFinally free of the hell-hole of Midnight Stag. I would like to thank /u/phteven_j for offering up the prize, and severly underestimating how many people would go a month with Midnight Stag.\n\nAfter a month of Stag, LBdS would not have been my first choice but the daughter demanded it because I didn't use it on her birthday (Aug 16). I tried to explain that daddy needs a new phandle, but her being 7 didn't understand. Tomorrow I continue on the journey to kill off my tub of MLS Ruby's Green.\n\nAfter a month of using a brush with almost no backbone going to the B8 was a shock to the system. There is a ton of backbone, which I was not a fan of because it took a little bit of work, but I'm sure I'll get used to it. Glad to be back to the Land of Animal brushes. Using a synth all month just drives home that they don't really have personality, and I much prefer my badgers, and one boar.\n\nThis is my first go with a Karve, which is on loan from a very generous fellow redditor. I've been debating on picking one up. What's been stopping me is the plethora of plate choices, and preferring a milder shave. I've read the numerous reviews comparing them to razors that I have never tried, so that was no help. But now that I've tried the C-plate i can see what everyone is raving about. The C was great, just about where I like it. There was almost no blade feel, and angle was on the easier side to get down. Am interested to see how it does with a head shave, or if I will go back to using the Schick or the Timeless Bronze.\n\nZingari Man Balm is also a new product to me today. So far my face feels good, but will really put it through its paces in the coming colder months. I would say pick it up if you like balms.\n\nHave a nice Sunday everyone!",

And the winner is.....\n\n* Brush: AP Shave CO Faux Horsehair (new)\n* Razor: Parker Variant\n* Blade: Kai (new)\n* Lather: Ariana and Evans Khalifa (new)\n* Post : Ariana and Evans Khalifa\n* EdP: Ariana and Evans Khalifa (new)\n\nThe items marked (new) are new for me and most have been staring at me and mocking me for the last month.\n\nSome first impressions:\n\nThe brush is very nice. As my first brush with non-white tips it fellt odd everytime i looked at it, the brown tips mixed with white soap made me feel as if I didn't have enough soap loaded. If you are familliar with AP synthetics it feels like a SynBad with more backbone. I'm going to use it for a few days to get a better feel for it and compare it to my SynBad. If first impressions hold up I may end up selling or PIFing the SynBad, gorgeously soft tips but too floppy for my tastes. Also have a SilkSmoke to test.\n\nBlade. I now understand why people describe Kais as a smother Feather. I did a three pass (with, cross, against) with the razor set at 2.5, 2.5, 5 (Variant is an adjustable). I was BBS/DFS after my XTG pass\n\nLather. A&E deserves the love it gets but holy hell is it thirsty. Since I judge soaps on a pass/fail grade - and a soap has to be horrible to fail, my face took 20+ years of cartridges and hot water - I'll leave the reviews to u/Candisor and u/dendj55.\n\nPost/EdP Much like soaps, scents, to my untrained nose, are graded on a smells good/doesn't smell good grade. Khalifa, to me, smells wonderful. Not a daily wear scent but definitely a going out or an I want to smell nice scent. It will get you noticed. Three pumps of the EdP may be too much. I will know in two or three hours.\n\n*Through a strange turn of events I ordered more shave software (mostly) this month than any other single month in my shave career. I'll have a Monday Mail Call post detailing the hows and whys of the everything that showed up this month. Possibly as a warning to others.\n\nedit spelling",

I did an extra half-pass going ATG around the jawline and up the cheeks, and got excellent results.\n\nThe most noticeable difference, believe it or not, was not the change from Williams to Cade, though that certainly was easier to lather and had a vastly better scent. Rather, it was the change of razor. The #72 Friodur is much more substantial than the modern Dovo \"Sunday Shaver\" I've been using for the last month, and the steel *feels* different. The draw on the strop has a different quality to it, which (surprisingly) carries over to the shave. In any case, the edge was great and I got a BBS above the jawline and a DFS below. Total shave time from opening the cabinet to take the first thing out to closing it to put the last thing away was about 15 minutes.",

I missed using something else. This shave was full of my favorites. My ATT SE1 was out on loan for a bit and it was great using it after a few months. I think I'll upgrade this badboy to the stainless steel version in order to curb my RAD. It was nice using a brush with a bit more backbone compared to the one I used all last month. Lastly, I freakin love Texaus. That is all.",

I love me some YRP. A lot of folks here already know what the soap smells like, but if you don't own the matching EdT let me tell you: it smells even better. It's like... using the soap is like watching a 15 year old 320x240 rip of your favorite TV show, and then the perfume is like watching it in 4K. I'm pairing it with Skin Bracer with its powdery fresh green-ness, which compliments the YRP *very* nicely. Totally different scents with no real crossover notes between them, but dang do they ever smell good together.\n\n**So is it good?** Yes. It's one of only two rosy fragrances in my collection for good reason.\n\nYesterday I layered some [Pink Sugar](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Aquolina/Pink-Sugar-975.html) and [Hanae](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Hanae-Mori/Hanae-by-Hanae-Mori-27339.html). Results were sweet, as expected. Half a minute of cotton candy, a couple hours of berries and toffee, and a creamy smooth powdery vanilla musk drydown. Hells yes. Felt a little out of place while I dug trenches to lay a heavy timber border for my new patio though... Brut probably would have been more on-theme with the day's activities.",

AA Shave No. 28**\n*MRTNG's Ultra Nightmare Mode*\nDogwood Handcrafts' Midnight Stag Side Challenge\n\n[Gear Pic](https://imgur.com/bWnllic) :: [Video](https://youtu.be/0pwyQOCDfRQ)\n\n#### ❧ General Notes / TL;DR\nVery good shave today. Trying a dry load again, but with more loading than last time. It worked out nicely. But since my normal damp method is faster, and I get the same lather, I'm not likely to use the dry method very often on this soap base.\n\nSo here I am on the normal SOTDs again, after Austere August. Well, I'm using the same AA setup because I started things a bit late due to extenuating circumstances. I got permission, and now I just have to do 4 days in Sept to have 31 consecutive days of Midnight Stag to complete [Steven's](/u/phteven_j) challenge. What we won't do for one of his magical brushes, eh?\n\n3 days to go.\n\n#### ❧ Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Timeless - Stainless Steel .68 - Open Comb ::: Gillette - Nacet ‹202 uses›)*\n\nChugging along nicely.\n\n#### ❧ Soap Notes\n*^(Chiseled Face - Midnight Stag)*\n\n\n\nThe gasoline/pungent part of the scent seems to be less intense than at first. I'm definitely noticing the leather and wood more lately.\n\nScent Strength: 4/10, lightly present during shaving.\n\nLather: bowl lathering this time with a goal to try the really-dry-load method again, but this time to load more. First time was way to skimpy at 15 secs.\n\nNot really all that much difference in the lather I ended up with any more than my usual methods.\n\n* 45 second load with damp-but-squeezed-out soft boar brush\n* 4 tsp water added to build the lather\n* = 4 passes\n\n\n\n#### ❧ Brush Notes\n*^(Zenith - B2 Pro Aluminum 26mm‹34 uses›)*\n\nI rank this guy similar to a Semogue Owners Club boar, but with more hairs and just a little less splay.\n\n----\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Just a little tugging\n*Neck*: Just a little tugging\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Very Close Shave\n*Neck*: Few hairs are showing some tip length (with most being cut flush)\n\n----\n\nDogwood Handcrafts' Midnight Stag Side Challenge is sponsored by the awesome dude behind [dogwoodhandcrafts.com](https://dogwoodhandcrafts.com/)\n\n[Austere August Intro Thread](/r/Wetshaving/comments/chv8g9/austere_august_2019)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm) *and also in the sub's sidebar.*\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

On the other hand, I wish I had had this on my scalp on some of the hotter days over the last couple weeks. Absolutely great shave this morning. The Noble Otter lather was thick and slick. The Karve C plate mowed right through 3 days of growth, though after a month with the Wolfie I now consider the C plate to be more on the mild side. And nearly 2 hours after the shave, I'm still feeling a cool tingle from the aftershave.\n\nAlso, this was my first shave with the B3 Theo which I obtained late in Austere August. I think this one is a bit more scritchy than my previous B3 (it was a straight up B3 for B3 swap). Now all of my Declaration knots are either in Declaration or Dogwood handles. I guess I've turned into a fanboy.",

Paired with a well performing synthetic brush and a fresh blade, it made short work of my stubble and left my face smooth and happy.\n\nThe scent is interesting. For me, I get a mix of incense and smoke. It is an intoxicating scent to say the least. Very deep and complex. Looking forward to the dry down to see what other scents I can pick out.\n\nHappy Sunday!",

WTG, XTG, and another XTG clean up. The cream worked great. I did hold a bit too much water with the brush but I had enough passes to last the whole shave. The brush was a surprise. Although it was scritchy, I enjoyed the overall feel. Razor + blade combo was superb. Mild and efficient shave. Mild post shave to wrap it all up.\n\nIt is SO NICE to be able to enjoy other shaving gears. Even though I still get similar shaves, the feel and the experience is different for each gear. The new razor felt great as it had a good heft to it and good stability. The one I'm more suprised about is the horse hair brush. I remember I disliked past shaves with it because of the heavy scritch. However, after rinsing it with shampoo and conditioner, the horse hair brush felt great on the face. The scritch is still there but more like an initial boar rather than a wire black badger brush. I'm glad that I did not sell off the Vie long brush and I plan to keep it for the long haul.",

AA Shave No. 30**\n*MRTNG's Ultra Nightmare Mode*\nDogwood Handcrafts' Midnight Stag Side Challenge\n\n[Gear Pic](https://imgur.com/wN95bUz) :: [Video](https://youtu.be/pZB4wPCGz5s)\n\n#### ❧ General Notes / TL;DR\nPretty good shave. Tried a really dry lather, but working it in more. Which did help some, but these lathers are just not for me.\n\nOne more day and I finish my 31 day Stag Stint!\n\n#### ❧ Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Timeless - Stainless Steel .68 - Open Comb ::: Gillette - Nacet ‹204 uses›)*\n\nA little bit of tugging today, because the lather was more dry than usual. But was fun to try out.\n\n#### ❧ Soap Notes\n*^(Chiseled Face - Midnight Stag)*\n\n\n\nThe gasoline/pungent part of the scent seems to be less intense than at first. I'm definitely noticing the leather and wood more lately.\n\nScent Strength: 4/10, lightly present during shaving.\n\nLather: mixed up a dry lather this time. twice as much soap with same water. So was thicker for sure.\n\nNormally, this won't bond with my face as well, and I won't get as comfortable of a shave. But I worked it in more and was able to mitigate that a little.\n\nDisadvantages to this kind of overly-dry lather, IMO:\n\n* irritated my face a little with a dry feel after, where wet one doesn't\n* requires longer time to work into face\n* and even so, still does not protect skin quite as well; blade is felt more\n* uses more soap\n* more build-up on hardware\n* and lastly, on my neck I did not get nearly as close of a shave as I did with my usual wet lather.\n\nAdvantages to dry, IMO:\n\n* stronger scent on the lather\n* creamier feel\n\nSpecs:\n\n* 15 second load with lightly-wet soft boar brush\n* 2 tsp water added to build the lather\n* = 5 passes\n\n\nBowl - I used the XL version of this 3D-printable bowl:\nhttps://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3392930\n\n----\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Just a little tugging\n*Neck*: A little irritating\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Very Close Shave\n*Neck*: Many hairs show whisker tips with a little length to them\n\n----\n\nDogwood Handcrafts' Midnight Stag Side Challenge is sponsored by the awesome dude behind [dogwoodhandcrafts.com](https://dogwoodhandcrafts.com/)\n\n[Austere August Intro Thread](/r/Wetshaving/comments/chv8g9/austere_august_2019)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm) *and also in the sub's sidebar.*\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

No real difference in the slickness or cushion from the previous shaves. TOBS Sandalwood is actually described as a classic fougere fragrance, and that makes it difficult to pick the sandalwood out. The sandalwood base gets covered by the floral and citrus notes across the scent profile. I get more of the floral notes than anything else. If this was in an unmarked tub, I wouldn't think of sandalwood after smelling the container.\n\n[Updated Calendar](https://imgur.com/BpoI8pl)",

I have a few samples that are over two years old. I need to either use them or pitch them. I'd rather not waste them. I guess I'll see if I have the discipline to stick with it.",

I re-applied 3 separate times yesterday because I could hardly smell the EDT after 45 minutes. In fact, I'd given up by 2:00. I smoked some ribs and then sprayed a little of the Eleven/DFS LE they were handing out at Maggards and I could smell it through the smoke at least 3 hours later. It's hard to justify a set of cream, gel, and EDT for over $100 when the scent won't make it out of the house, but I'd happily gift it to anyone because the smell is so awesome.\n\nLife is short, shave with good gear.",

I'm still very pleased with the scent. The Lime makes for a punchy lavender. The Southern Witchcrafts Lavender Splash is a nice transition with the smoothest lavender I've been able to find and nourishes the skin beautifully. It's been hot here and the Fresca Intensa EdT is amazing in the heat. Who knew citrus could stay and blend with the base so well for so long.\n\n\n\n\nI'm only on my third straight razor shave so I expect some growing pains. After using a Shavette for two straight months, the difference in sharpness is extremely noticeable. I'm finding that the straight needs a lot more pressure to do any close cutting. I can get a good shave but it feels like I'm really working for it. I trust that the blade is honed properly and I know it will never be as sharp as a Shavette. If more pressure is normal then can live with that. Otherwise I'll have to start looking at my stropping. Thoughts u/Old_Hiker and u/needsmorementhol ?",

Base performed remarkably well, but it was scented with something that lit my face up. Normally I lather up while I clean and pick up, today it was a race to get the second pass completed before I felt the need to dunk my face in a sink of cold water. There have been a few other scents that I've reacted too but the only one I can remember is MLS La Belle du Sud, while still a bit burning I can do the lather while I clean up. There has been another soap that I wasn't able to get through a first pass, but can't remember for the life of me what it was.\n\nStill digging on the Balm. Very nice product. /u/CosmoBarber's advice on a damp face was spot on.\n\nCL-Gloria was a nice match scent wise to the soap.\n\nHave a nice Tuesday!",

I've been a bit afraid of using one of their soaps since Lilac nearly burned my fave off. Luckily, it must have been an issue with a fragrance oil rather than the soap base.\n\nWhether yes the post shave combo or the soap, my face feels incredible today. Brickell makes great products, they're just a tad pricey. 2oz of balm for $13 isn't bad and I feel it's one if their better deals.\n\nLess humid weather isn't here yet but hopefully soon.

This scent though is fantastic. It is the yin to Bell Ringer's yang. Bell Ringer seeks to pull out the sweeter elements of Grapefruit, while Bay, Patchouli, Grapefruit dampens those sweet elements, but still leaves the an awesome fizzy grapefruit. I don't need any more soap, but its going to be really hard not to buy this one. I bet its even better in splash form.",

Meaning I'm not bleeding and my face is smoooooth.\n\nI again used the razor at its most agressive setting. The blade just lookad at my face, looked back at me, and said \"Is that the best you got?. Easy Peasy\".\n\nThe lather today was not as good as the last two days (A&E, NO) but right now I am entirely blaming that on the brush as I was kinda fighting with it. This brush is STIFF!* Holy Cow, I like brushes with backbone but this one may be pushing the limits. Actually it may have crossed them. If I named my brushes I would call this one Nurse Ratchet! I have 5 sythetics and 4 of them feel the same when you run your hand over them when they are dry, the differences manifest when the brush hits your face. This one you can feel stiffness as soon as you touch it. When I got this brush I figured it is either going to be my favorite or most hated brush.\n\nAs far as my opinion on the scent goes, its ok in the soap, better as an AS, and wonderful as an EdT.\n\n​\n\n*In the brush description on his Etsy store, AP Shave CO states that V3 of the SilkSmoke is thicker than normal and may be a BIT (emphasis mine) stiffer. I'll be keeping an eye out for the next version.",

Guess will find out over the long term if irritation develops. I see advantages to this for me. The last couple of shaves have been better, especially using derby. I had tried a derby blade during AA and was just not good for me. I just think my prep was not good enough but with the additional preshave soap step now, things are looking better.",

Previously when I loaded samples I threw a quarter teaspoon in the bowl, hit it with a wet brush, and built the lather right there... but since I wanted to face lather the last few days I just loaded the brush until it looked normal. Neither time required a full 1/4 tsp of soap to get to that level, which suggests to me that I probably use about 1 gram of soap per face-lathered shave rather than the 1.3-1.5 grams I was previously using when bowl lathering. Interesting.\n\nAnyway, after re-testing this soap with face lathering, I'm going to stick with its original tentative SpongeScore of 8/10. If it can impress me in the middle of the winter (which isn't that far off where I live...) then I'll bump it up to a 9/10.\n\nAfter going a whole month without being able to wear scented aftershaves, I decided to spend this week wearing nothing But aftershave for fragrance. The usual 2-3 spritzes on the face post shave, and an extra spritz or two on the wrist before heading out the door. (All my splashes are decanted into 2 oz glass spray bottles for the portion-control they offer. Very convenient and good for travel too.) I don't have a lot of splashes so it won't take long to get through my lineup: Skin Bracer (two days ago), Clubman (yesterday), AV Green (today), AV Blue, Epsilon Blue, and Cool Wave.",

Did overall really well but had a fair bit of general irritation. Again - not sure if it was the ballads or the extra passes and buffing.\n\nAnyways have a good one y'all!",

Maybe I've gotten better at using a DE since the last time, I don't remember my shaves being this good. I'm sure the bison base had in that as well.\n\nShort work week, and I'm going to Disneyland with the family starting Sunday and will be gone a whole week, so I'm in a fantastic mood.

(Unexpectedly, perhaps!). The D plate has a bit more blade feel than the B plate, but much less than (say) the Blackbird. Given than Karve sells these plates for less than $30, experimentation is definitely encouraged. I like the bracketing effect of having a B and D plate, but all in one seekers can probably go with a C plate. 6 uses on an Astra is unusual for me, but this blade felt fine today.\n\n**Brush**: A close rival to the Simpson Chubby 2, at less money and more individualistic distinction, due to the lovely all wood handle. Plus much shorter break in and more ergo handle than Simpson offers. A firm three band is a great badger, and many two band owners should try the experience.\n\n**Lather**: A great spicy scent and technical performance that runs with the artisan leaders. High price, awful packaging, and limited availability are the issues with this very small batch soap.\n\n**Frag:** Eau D' Cthulhu. What the squid faced fella would wear to a cocktail party mixer with the other Great Old Ones. Aquatic with reduced citrus and more of a dark vegetal bite in the mix. Very oceanic, but not cloying or cliched. Projection and longevity are also top rate, again anomalous for an aquatic.",

It's a great brush! I'm putting it back in rotation.\n\nToday's shave was outstanding! Sooo so smooth, and perfectly close! Hello yeah! Bonus cooling agent thy doesn't hurt like menthol can sometimes (especially when I inevitably get some in my eyes lol)\n\nDFS and it's cooler than yesterday!!! BOOM!!!!\n\nHappy shaving all!!!\n\nEdit: the little spray bottle on the right is something I really like - I poured some Creeper into that instead of trying to use that ridiculous bottle. The bottle has a wide opening, and doesn't have a flow restrictive, so is super easy to make a mess and waste product. This helps rectify that! Hell yeah!!!!!",

WTG, XTG, and another XTG clean up. The Proraso Cream + Preshave was an amazing combo. The preshave gives it a kick of slickness and menthol. The cream finishes it off and puts enough protection for the shave. Brush felt good; a bit prickly but with a good exfoliation and no real discomfort. Razor + blade felt great at setting 7. Slight more blade feel but still a mild feeling setup. Mild post shave to wrap it all up.\n\nI really enjoyed the shave today. A clean menthol start to the day. I got couple soaps to test out so I'm excited to try those out. Also, I have couple SE razors on the way as well as a Schick injector provided by a generous redditor. Life is good and I can't wait to enjoy more great shaves! Oh also, I will be featuring the SOC tomorrow for the first time so stay tuned!",

Piney, cedery, and fresh. It lathers easily with very little loaded onto the brush. I've found myself on a T&S kick lately. Even the scents that are not for me perform amazingly well.\n\nGood 2 pass shave with no irritation, nicks, or weepers.\n\nHappy Wednesday!",

This scent is a tricky one for me. Sometimes it smells like rosemary, sometimes it smells like cedar, and sometimes it smells like itself. Regardless, I really like it.\n\nYesterday I played around with the Fresca Intensa EdT by first adding a shot of blonde oud by OK Fine Fragrance. Not that It needs messing with, but I love citrus and oud. It worked out really well.\n\nToday I'm trying out Noble Otter's Two Kings EdP. I've been looking forward to this for a long time.",

I had smelled it at the Maggard Meetup back in June and remembered really liking it, but the amount of things to smell that at the meet is so overwhelming that I was glad to confirm that it is in fact something I liked.\n\nI noted this in a post a few days ago but the reserve soap base is very interesting to me. It changes so much from one of his new versus how it looks and performs over a few weeks time. When it is new you have to be extremely careful not to overload it. After it dries, it becomes very hard and I think it's a lot more difficult to lather. I think I prefer how it performs when it is new, but unfortunately that's not going to last. It's still great either way, but I like the ease of loading when the soap is soft.",

It also didn't hurt that today I was not fighting the brush. Thinking about yesterdays experience I wondered if some of the stiffnes of the brush could be mitigated by starting my lather in a bowl so I broke out my bowl and did a half bowl half face lather today. Combined with some idea of what the brush was lik it semmed to work rather well. The biggest problem I had today was the splay with the 24 mm knot*. The stiffnes means there is no middle amount of splay, it's either all or none. This knot also holds a prodigious amount of lather. I did a third pass today, completely unnecessary judging by the sound, just because I had so much. Probably could have done 5 passes with no problem. Like yesterdays shave my scent preference is Edt > AS > soap. I think the difference in preference between EdT and AS is entirely due to the initial, slight wiff of menthol I get with the AS. Yesterdays Admiral EdT I could still smell about 10 hrs later.\n\n*I prefer smaller knots because I have a mustache and goatee. Not short and stubbly ones but ones that are long enough to catch a lot of lather. I have to pull the lather off of my goatee or it gets into the pivot end of my straight. After my ATG pass I can and have wet my hands and rubbed the lather in my goatee along my jawline. This gives enough protection for a touchup if I want.",

I was hoping to get slapped across the face with Irish Spring. I don't know what this is but it only slightly resembles that. Add the muted scent that is there and it's just very meh for me. SS's Tallow soap is very good though. Do props where it's due.\n\nI'm falling more and more out of love with the game changer. It's soon going to get added to sell pile which already includes Mamba 70 and Blackland Dart. It's a fine shaver but I just get a better shave from the Karve and Rockwell 6c.",

Well, it did. Oddly, it was a noisier shave than the Astra, but shave 1 seemed about as efficient as the sharper Astra. The D plate is definitely mild enough to be a daily driver.\n\nI swapped out the guilloche handle for the gladius handle. They felt roughly the same - grippy, balanced, trouble free - so the choice is really aesthetic. The gladius pattern is intricate and pretty, but so is the base guilloche design.\n\n**Post:** Highly effective balm, but pricier than other equally effective options. The scent is really the draw here, as the WK balms match the excellent scents of the soaps, one of the more powerful and intricately scented balms around, yet one whose soothing and moisturizing is not at all affected by the heavy fragrance load. The packaging and precise \"one dose\" dispenser are also admirable, and feel very premium.\n\n**Brush:** Charming design, good weighty feel, and a synth knot that is big and dense without being sloppy.\n\n**Frag:** LGC straddles summer and fall, offering fruit and florals superimposed on a weighty, darkish base. As with all B&M scents, the longevity and projection are immense. Value for the money certainly!",

It's been a minute since I've used a GEM. Much different feel obviously, but great results. I continued the fall theme with Darkfall aftershave and finished off with APR Torchwood. I liked this fragrance much more the first couple of times that I wore it. Today it smells off putting to me. Definitely not a must have, but I'm glad to have tried a sample.",

My parents got their hair cut at the local beauty salon because the owners were friends from church, so that's where my sister and I got our hair cut, too. But when I went with my roommate to his home in South Carolina, he insisted that we go get a straight razor shave at his barbershop. It was an all around great experience... hot towel, warm lather, old dude who knew what he was doing with a razor, splash of cologne, the whole 9 yards. That said, I really have no clear memory of what that barbershop smelled like. I'm just going to assume it was somewhere in the ballpark of the three incredible scents I used this morning.",

AA Shave No. 31**\n*MRTNG's Ultra Nightmare Mode*\nDogwood Handcrafts' Midnight Stag Side Challenge\n\n[Gear Pic](https://imgur.com/kUM8rj9) :: [Video](https://youtu.be/r2srjCKXnaQ)\n\n#### ❧ General Notes / TL;DR\nHere we are at 31 days of Stag! I can see why it is [Steven's](/u/phteven_j) favorite scent. There are layers to it, it's uber masculine, and there's just nothing else out there like it.\n\nThanks, Steven, for this excellent challenge and throwing 14 of us into a month of our lives that will give us stories for a long time.\n\nA recap of the stuff I posted on Aug 31 as what I learned this month...\n\n* Bowl more efficient\n* the first pass sometimes needs to be wetter than the the subsequent ones.\n\n#### ❧ Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Timeless - Stainless Steel .68 - Open Comb ::: Gillette - Nacet ‹205 uses›)*\n\nJust fine as usual.\n\nGonna stop at 205 on this blade for a little while. I'll pick it up after a bit, while I enjoy some other razors that I've had to leave on the shelf the last 2 months.\n\n#### ❧ Soap Notes\n*^(Chiseled Face - Midnight Stag)*\n\n\n\nThe gasoline/pungent part of the scent seems to be less intense than at first. I'm definitely noticing the leather and wood more lately.\n\nScent Strength: 4/10, lightly present during shaving.\n\nLather: mixed up my usual lather this time. And as it has all month, this excellent base gave me a great lather.\n\nSpecs:\n\n* 7 second load with lightly-wet soft boar brush\n* 2 tsp water added to build the lather\n* = 4 passes\n\nBowl - I used the XL version of this 3D-printable bowl:\nhttps://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3392930\n\n#### ❧ Brush Notes\n*^(Zenith - B2 Pro Aluminum 26mm‹37 uses›)*\n\nWell, as the last of the AA shaves, I'll put something in for the brush. I haven't had to so far because i was always giving it the same accolades: soft tips that have split well, medium backbone that's just right for me, and easy splay to give good face feel. It's an excellent brush that I think many would enjoy. I was glad to use a Zenith this month to help more folks know about the brand.\n\n----\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Many hairs show whisker tips with a little length to them\n\n----\n\nDogwood Handcrafts' Midnight Stag Side Challenge is sponsored by the awesome dude behind [dogwoodhandcrafts.com](https://dogwoodhandcrafts.com/)\n\n[Austere August Intro Thread](/r/Wetshaving/comments/chv8g9/austere_august_2019)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm) *and also in the sub's sidebar.*\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

After a few days off shaving during the long holiday weekend, I knew which one I wanted to start off September with. Paired with my favorite razor and a brand new Platinum blade, this was a treat. This is the only soap I've tried whose scent lingers on me throughout the day. Even paired with a differently-scented splash (as I unfortunately do not own the matching A&E splash yet) I'm mostly getting scent notes from the soap 3 hrs later. Will definitely put the splash on my wish list.",

WTG, XTG, and another XTG clean up. Stirling does not let me down and provided a slick and creamy lather today. Brush felt great and there was a lot of flow-through of water. I had enough lather for a 2 &1/2 pass so I'm a happy camper. Razor + blade felt great at setting 5; mild but efficient. Mild post shave to wrap it all up.\n\nSOC was definitely hit its mark. However, it was slightly more soft than what it seemed like. Many people said it was rough and scritchy on the face but I felt none of that. In fact, it seemed a bit more soft but not floppy. I'm still great to be able to use it and I'll be doing so more often. I got couple other razors and brushes to feature so more new products for the future shaves!",

[Here's](https://imgur.com/a/bdkxzZt) my PIF for today: A 2oz tub of Catie's Bubbles La Terre Verte, about 80% full, only ever scooped. I got it as a PIF from that prolific PIF-er, and all around good chap, u/Cosmobarber. I just don't get on with the oakmoss in it so I'm passing it along.\n\nI'm also throwing in a frankenrazor - R41 head on a Yaqi short handle. It's a standard thread so you'll be able to use either with pretty much any other DE handle / head.\n\nPick a number 1-100 and I'll draw the winner in tomorrow's SOTD post.\n\nGoing back to the Masumune OC for the first time in while helped focus my thoughts somewhat. I can use the Masamune every day with nary a weeper or irritation in sight.\n\nHowever, it's not as efficient as the NEW RFB and I can't get as close a shave with it. It's also just not as fun to shave with - I'll get a smooth, problem free, decent shave every time. Whereas with the NEW there's that element of danger and excitement. There's more blade exposure and more efficiency. It can deliver a beautiful BBS, but it can also produce a bunch of nicks and weepers if you aren't careful.\n\nIt'd almost certainly be better for my skin to use something milder / safer than the NEW on a daily basis, but I just can't give it up. And I think that's what's been bothering me recently.",

Pick a number 1-20 (your responsibility to make sure your number isn't taken, first person to pick a number will be considered to be the rightful picker). Will announce tomorrow in my SOTD Post.\n\nShave was nice. After [Rud's Review](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/cvdj6l/review_santa_maria_novella_crema_da_barba/) of SMN and all the disagreement it caused I managed to snag a sample from someone on IRC. Mashed it into one of my empty tubs and loaded up. Barely loaded enough for a first pass and had to go back to get enough for a 2nd pass. Performance is nice, will probably use it again on Saturday. I don't know if I'll pick up a tub, but was nice to try it.\n\nHave a nice Thursday everyone!",

It's time for me to pay back the PIFs I have received.\n\n\nSo to start I am giving away my used Stirling Haverford soap and balm. The soap is a refill puck in a sample tin that I have scooped from. It hasn't been weighed but there has to be around 3oz left. Great scent I just haven't given it much love.\n\n\nPick a number 1 - 25 and I will announce the winner tomorrow morning in my STOD.",

Wow. So...take all this with a total grain of menthol, as it was my first time using a Barrister's Reserve product, and FG in general. I've been waiting for this one for a long time, so I was excited. The smell off the puck was intoxicating, and I can't describe any of it, because that's just not my style, baby. But I have to admit, I was a bit nervous. I kept reading and hearing things about the Reserve line and it's ease (or lack thereof) of use, and since I still don't feel like a pro wetshaver, I was resigned to needing some practice to get it right. I was wrong. Real wrong. I loaded for approx. 30 seconds with my Maggard synth, and had a thick, pasty, sticky epoxy like stuff spread on my face. I added water. I added more water. I added water. I had no issues, and within a few minutes, I had some of the slickest, shiniest shit I've ever seen or felt. I have Night Music in the Glissant formula and this blows it away. Maybe I got lucky? I don't know, but it was a fantastic shave, and the scent of this stuff is a clear front runner for my fav yet. Side note : I'm noticing a big difference between the aftershave and the soap, anyone have any idea what it is? Like, the aftershave smells \"sharper\" and more \"pungent/sour\" to me? It's still good, and that goes away after it dries up pretty quickly, but what the heck is the note that is doing that?\n\nTear it up today boys.",

I'm still very pleased with this scent and would add it to any \"good lavender\" list. I made some improvements with the straight today so I'm pretty pleased with that. Still have some work to do. Noble Otter's Two King EdP was amazing yesterday. A coworker described it as \"inviting\" which sounds good to me. I'm really pleased with this one.\n\nYesterday I [received a FedEx notice](https://i.imgur.com/pD9oYuF.png) that my FG/FA master pack has been damaged in shipping. Must have leaked pretty badly since it says the barcode was unreadable. It Was supposed to arrive tomorrow. I guess we'll see what \"handling per shipper instructions\" means. Last time I received a soggy package that smelled fantastic. Maggards fixed me up proper when this happened last month so I know it'll be fine. The delay is a bummer though.\n\nEdit: I completely spaced the theme. I promise I've got a PIF coming soon.\n\nEdit the edit: I've got a once or twice scooped tub of CBL Soaps - Barbershop. This is the Wagu tallow stuff. Pick 1 - 50 and I'll announce in tomorrow's thread.",

In any case, unscented soap brigade continues onward. I also think I prefer SBS vs Siliski unscented soaps but that's like choosing the right vs left hand. I am left hand dominate but would not want to lose my right.",

Yesterday's shave with the .84 plate wasn't great. It was a bit rough and in the end not all that close. So I assumed today's shave with .68 plate would be similar but it wasn't. Today's shave was excellent. I likely should have used the same gear to give each base plate a fair shake but I was surprised by the result.\n\nA&E Revolution was fantastic. I have avoided every soap advertising as spice forward. Revolution is based on Victor Rolf Spicebomb. I don't know the fragrance but this soap smells amazing. B&M Reserve Spice was a nice pairing. Definitely based on different fragrances but in the same family.",

But post with the aftershave brings out the scent similar to Gothique. Not strong mushroom though, but definitely dark.",

I'm a frag noob so the majority of the scents I have been introduced to have been through wet shaving with the various artisan dupes. I liked Executive Man and Sharp Dressed Man enough to know that this might have been something I would enjoy too and purchased a sample of Mountain Man. What I had not accounted for at the time was the method of storage when I first got my sample so it was a surprise when the set smelled a bit different than the sample.\n\nI continued to use it but could not put a finger on why I didn't like it as much as EM or SDM. I think it's because my sniffer picks up a light spearmint scent for some reason and while it's my favorite gum flavor of choice, I don't seem to enjoy it on my face. The scent doesn't last long so I have continued to rotate it in every once in awhile but I don't love it so up for grabs is the following:\n\n-[Stirling Mountain Man Set](https://imgur.com/a/Eam7hps)\n\n-Stirling Barbershop Shampoo Bar Sample (unused)\n\n-Miscellaneous goodies\n\nTo enter pick a number between 1-25 and I will announce the winner with tomorrow's SOTD.",

After a solid month of using Williams, I laugh at the idea that it's difficult to lather. It wanted to froth up a bit during loading, but just working it on my face for a while with some circular scrubbing strokes and some painting strokes then adding water slowly got me a great lather. Unfortunately, the great lather was somewhat wasted because it was uncomfortably warm in the bathroom while I was shaving - forgot to leave the window open overnight!\n\nI also nicked myself for the first time in about 35 days today. Shaved right over what appears to have been a small zit about an inch to the left of my chin cleft. Didn't even feel it when I went over it, and it was all closed up by the time I applied the aftershave, but dang I had a nice streak going. Oh well.",

I'm planning on one it it wasn't the hardware I used today so wouldn't have worked out.\n\nAnyways dialed in a much better lather today and was pretty happy with the shave. I'm less worried about the blade but I'm still not impressed with it. It's firmly in the \"alright but not spectacular\" category for now. I've got a bunch and will give them another go here soon.\n\nAdmiral was amazing as always. Love that stuff.\n\nIt's Friday Eve friends - let's act like it.",

I imagine it would clear one's nose out pretty well when they have a cold. For character it's somewhere between the \"pretty floral\" Aqua Velva and the \"dirty-clean blue collar\" vibe I get from B&M Cool.\n\n**Today's theme is PIF. DAT. SHIT. and I do indeed intend to PIF one of today's items. However, I am going to wait until Sunday to do it because *reasons*. It will make sense when I post my PIF Sunday.** (For long-time readers of my SOTD posts, I bet you can guess which one of these items I'm itching to part with.)",

Today's shave was equally efficient.\n\n**Lather:** I do notice the face is just a wee bit sorer at the end of the shave with the Karve D plate. Reserve's exemplary 95 FAYS score felt more like a 90 with the Karve D, true with both Astra and Bolzano blades.\n\nBig issue? Not really, as a good post shave treatment makes everything copacetic. The Karve D plate is not exactly the same as the B plate in terms of ease of daily use though, so there is some trade-off between efficiency and transient facial comfort involved in using Karve D versus Karve B. This does not really surprise me.\n\n**Theme?:** NYC's overly capacitated / underly cogitated version of the USPS has taken all the fun out of PIFs for me. Maybe if a PIF was needed to save the world, I might be willing to stand in line for 40 minutes and deal with eejits. But no guarantees!",

Whipping up a great lather requires almost no effort on my part.\n\n[OK Fine Fragrances](https://www.okfinefragrances.com/) was first brought to my attention last month by u/Kcam9908 in one of his SOTD posts. They make small batch fragrances that are 1 main note with maybe 1-2 supporting notes aged in used liquor barrels (bourbon, mezcal, rye, and gin). As soon as I saw their VBO - which stands for **V**anilla aged in a **B**ourban **O**ak barrel - I knew I was in [trouble](https://imgur.com/gallery/uu9pmDP). Vanilla and bourbon are two scent notes that will definitly get my undivided attention. My initial impression of the VBO was it was a slightly less sweet version of a vanilla Yankee Candle which was depressing because I like darker vanilla scents. After drydown however the scent became less sweet and more like the vanilla I prefer. This is a scent that doesn't scream \"LOOK AT ME!\" but is subtle, smells wonderful, and perfect for when you wish to go out and put a smile on everyones face or you're getting physically close to that someone special. Tomorrow I'm trying their AMO - **A**mber aged in **M**escal **O**ak - this also sounds very appealing to me.\n\nWas so excited to try the Edt that I forgot about the theme!\n\nEdit I didn't use it today but I'll PIF an AP Shave Co [22mm SynBad](https://www.etsy.com/listing/674634057/22mm-synbad-w-winter-handle-extra-dense?ref=shop_home_active_12). Soft, builds lather well, little floppy for my tastes. I like brushes with lots of backbone. Pretty sure by now you know the drill, pick a number between 1- 100, closest wins, winner announced in tomorrows SOTD.",

This is a really great scent. The bay isn't overpowering, it merges quite well with the earl grey notes, and it feels...breakfasty(?) without being gourmand. I really enjoy Dr. Jons soaps. Even after using something that most people consider a better base, switching to Dr. Jons doesn't leave me underwhelmed. It's a really fantastic soap and stands up to some of the best for me, vegan or tallow.",

It's made with wagyu beef tallow, because wagyu beef whatever is *always* better than standard beef whatever. Per the CBL website: **Dragon's Blood is a mysterious, sweet, earthy aroma. Notes of amber, patchouli, rose and sandalwood blend with nuances of jasmine and citrus to bring out subtle spice undertones. Hints of Vanilla and powder complete this classic scent.** It's definitely an incense scent, on the patchouli/earthy side. I paired it up with SW Sandalwood and CL Yuzu/Rose/Patchouli. All this scent ensemble needs now is a bit of jazz cabbage.\n\nAs this tub of wagyu soap was PIFed to me, so it is now being PIFed on to one of you glorious basterds.

SHIT.)**](https://imgur.com/Wu65LIi)\n\n* **Brush:** Zenith 28mm Chubby Scrubby\n* **Razor:** RR Game Changer .68\n* **Blade:** Parker Stainless (2)\n* **Lather:** [RazoRock - Mudder Focker - Soap](https://trythatsoap.com/collection/159/?product_type=soap)\n* **Post Shave:** [Chiseled Face - Easy Street - Aftershave](https://trythatsoap.com/collection/727/?product_type=aftershave)\n\nAfter using my .84 Game Changer all through August, I decided to switch back to the .68 for today's shave. I don't really need the more aggressive plate for my typical (one day) growth, and besides I was feeling a bit lazy (the .68 requires moderately less precision/attention than the .84).\n\nI had already resolved to finish out this tub of MF today, which I didn't quite kill during AA. That makes [two soaps I've finished in the last month](https://imgur.com/3SxhgQo), quite happy w/ that forward progress, so I'll jump on the bandwagon and celebrate with a PIF. Obviously, I'm not giving away an empty container. Instead, I'll offer up this [lightly-used](https://imgur.com/DCut4fs) bottle of [CL Unconditional Surrender AS](https://imgur.com/HfAdMHB). It's been taking up precious real estate in my medicine cabinet and not getting much use. My wife actually likes the scent so I've tried to give it a fair shot but in the end it's just too musky for me. I'd rather pass it along to someone else who would appreciate it more, and clear another spot in my lineup for something I'll use more often. Pick a # between 1-30 and I'll chose a winner in tomorrow's thread.",

My wife was looking for organic shampoos and I'd heard so much about their body soaps and shampoos that I ordered 35 bucks worth of it and I thought I'd treat myself to reach the shipping threshold. Note I already ordered Stirling shampoos and soaps and it barely arrived by the time I placed this order, this was definitely an impulse buy. I didn't see any that really stuck out to me and I hadn't even seen this scent before, it doesn't really fit any scent profile I already have. It's a fall/winter pine scent, scent is mid-light, but I wouldn't say that it falls among my favorite scents. Certainly doesn't fit my least favorite though, but lands somewhere in the middle. One more shave soap to add to the box, and now I've probably got7 bars of bath soaps and 3 bars of shampoo in addition to my old liquid shampoo. I really need to use up more soap...\n\nFrom yesterday's PIF, rando number generator was 7. Turns out it was guessed first. u/EldrormR, you win! PM me your deets.",

Today I set the straight aside and went with a familiar Shavette so that I could really get a feel for the base without the distraction of learning a new razor. The shave was ridiculously good. It felt good to use a Shavette again. The donkey milk and tallow base looks and feels great. Combine that with a great lavender scent and I'd call this one a winner.\n\n\n\nFor the Theme Thursday PIF K1986 was closest to the random 13 with a guess of ten. Send me your deets and I'll get this tub of CBL Barbershop out to you ASAP. Congrats!",

I don't know if I will pick one up. I have a few razors that I am quite content with but mainly it works out to be that it seems to be mild and aggressive to me at the same time. I'm not really sure how to describe it. And I'm not sure if it's something that will be remedied by just changing the plate.\n\nAs for yesterday's PIF.

Weird.\n\nThese two Gillette products have the same perfume in them but the gel base suppresses a lot of the notes and the fragrance doesn't last as long. Most days I vastly prefer the mentholated post-shave feel of the gel over the splash, except that if I have any razor burn it tends to be the most painful post-shave in my collection... not sure why, considering it says \"Sensitive Skin\" right on the package. Even Clubman hurts less on a bad shave day.\n\nAnyway, the scent from the gel dissipates pretty quickly and you only really get to enjoy the top and some heart notes. The splash is much stronger and the scent lasts all damn day, so I mostly just wear it as cologne. Sporty citrus and dihydromyrcenol up top; patchouli and smoke in the heart (not sure whether it's based on cade oil or birch tar but I've heard rumors of both); oakmoss, leather, musk, and woods in the base. Yup. It's a woody chypre with a sporty citrus opening, folks, and it's almost as cheap as Brut. Even comes in a glass bottle. Crazy.",

This fougere scent is light, powdery and really fantastic. I'm terrible at picking out individual notes but it's way more complex than I'm describing. I enjoyed the soap base which was easy to lather and I got a nice and slick yogurt like lather.\n\nOn to the PIF results. I spun the random number generator a few times to get a direct match and avoid any numbers being too close to each other and having to decide a tie breaker. The [random number generator](https://imgur.com/a/GP7vMa1) rolled a 20. Congrats to u/inTikiwetrust who choose this exact number in yesterday's SOTD post. PM me those deets.\n\nHappy Friday to all!!",

      "body": "Let's get the part everybody is intersted in out of the way. With [random.org](https://random.org) chosing [82](https://imgur.com/a/q1HdySq), the winner of my AP 22mm SynBad (dear God let him live in the states) is u/rp_Neo2000 with his choice of 54. Mad props to every one who participated. On to the boring stuff.\n\n**Brush:** Stirling Badger 24mm Fan\n\n**Razor:** Ralf Aust 6/8 Spanish point\n\n**Lather:** Summer Break Soaps SHH!\n\n**Post:** SummerBreak Soaps Icy Stare\n\n**EdT:** OK Fine Fragrances AMO\n\nSince this is another shave geared toward testing the EdT I'll just briefly touch on the other things that I've not yet opined on in this forum.\n\nThe brush. The only badger I own. It is quite possibly the perfect definition of gear that I dislike but... you know, that piece of gear that will never be your first or second (or possibly 4th) choice but it has that one redeeming quality that won't let you get rid of it and you still use it a couple, four times a month. I absolutely love the way this brush feels on my face when I lather. I dislike everything else about it and badgers in general*.\n\nThe soap. It was grossly unfair of me to use my badger on my first try of a new soap (see above). I always have to work at it and I'm never happy with the end results. Having said that I did eventually get a nice shiny, thick lather that overcame my incompetence and left me with a nice smooth face. Much like my experience with DG Admiral and a brush I was not used to, I am currently assuming any and all issues are with me and not the soap.\n\nThe AS. Ooooh Yeahhhh!!! This was my second time trying an AS with synthetic menthol and I have become a huge fan it. 20 minutes later and I'm still feeling the cooling goodness. Post shave care is great. u/rocketk455 if you ever want to attempt a synthetic version of Cryogen I will happily test for you.\n\nMy first impression overall of Summer Break Soaps can be summed up by the fact that I've rubbed my face a couple of times while typing this thinking \"Damm, my face feels good!\". Can't wait to hit this soap with a proper brush and try the other SBS sets (Cannonball and Field Day) that I have as they smell great off the puck.\n\nEdT. This is what I was looking forward to this AM. I gave a brief overview of OK Fine Fragrances yesterday, so you can hunt that down or google them yourself if you're interested. AMO stands for **A**mber aged in a **M**escal **O**ak barrel. Of all the scents they offer this was the only other (VBO being the first) sample I ordered specifically to see if I wanted to order a full bottle. Being that their scents are relatively simple I ordered the others more to educate my nose, if I found one that I also wanted that would just be a bonus. I thought this smelled pretty good from the vial but once I applied** it I was extemely pleased. Amber is one of those scent description that also makes me take notice, couldn't describe it with a gun to my head, but I know I like it. Right behind it I could smell the spicy mescal notes, not the cheap stuff that you get blackout on but the good stuff that you sip, minus the boozy alchohol smell. Amber and mescal is a combination that works very well in my opinion. Initially I was pretty sure that I was going to buy the VBO and put the AMO on my list of things to get in the future. Now it may come down to a coin flip. VBO is Tom Hanks - nice and everyone will love it, AMO is Steve Mcqueen, not any Mcqueen but The Thomas Crowne Affair Mcqueen - cool, classy, and a hint of danger.\n\n*Not looking to start a badger/synth flame war. I'll wait til I post my brush questions int the Daily Questions forum for that shitstorm. :-)\n\n**How do you guys apply samples from vials? Tip the vial up on your fingertip and smear it, or try to pour a tiny amount out?",

Not bad, but Astras in the same razor can get a few extra hours of smoothness out of the deal, more or less confirming that they are sharper than Bolzanos. The interesting thing is that the smooth feel of the Bolzies as seen in other razors is almost completely absent in the Karve D plate, meaning the blade feels moderately harsh in usage - almost like a GSB, but without the great efficiency of that less warm and fuzzy blade.\n\nSo, bottom line, Bolzano works well enough in the D plate, but does not seem optimal, given it's relatively high price per blade.\n\n**Brush**: One of my earliest \"good\" shaving brush acquisitions, the Duke is still doing great 6 years in. It's more pleasant to use than the Chubby due to a better handle. If I could have stopped at only one nice brush to own indefinitely, the Duke would have been a great choice. A broken in Simpson always gets a perfect hydration balance in its loading, and my examples at least have aged flawlessly.\n\n**Lather:** My favorite WK scent, and the best vegan base out there. The post shave face feel suffers a bit from the somewhat harsh Karve plate used, but this effect has been seen with every other soap used as well. Anyway, like vegan soaps? You need to try WK. Costlier than SW and CB, but the price difference seems justified to me as one truly gets a tallowy performance for the extra cost.",

I was watching the Packers game with my wife, and they started the game with three successive three-and-outs in what looked like a reprise of late-McCarthy-era offensive futility. At the end of the first quarter, my wife gave me a look before asking two questions:\n1. if I was going to finish my glass of rye\n2. if there weren't something more fun we could be doing than watching this game\n\nIn a display of uncharacteristic perceptiveness, I gave the right answers. I checked back in on the game around the end of the third quarter and the Packers had apparently pulled their heads partly out of their asses and were winning and not looking like last Thursday's leftovers on offense.\n\nAs for this morning, I considered going back to Williams for a penitential Friday shave, but couldn't work up the nerve so soon after a solid month of using the stuff. So I hit up the Fat again, and got a great lather. It wanted to froth on me while loading again - I guess I need a *really* dry brush - but a little perseverance paid off. The apparently magic steel Henckels used to make these razors felt great. Good closeness, no nicks, and I felt just a wee bit of sting when applying the splash.",

Drum roll please.... The bot rolled a 50 and u/kcam9908 was the closest with 52. Congrats!\n\nAnd speaking of PIFs, today's soap was part of u/rmic_'s very generous Austere August PIF to me. I absolutely love Chatillon Lux's Eau de Treget, which u/hawns describes as a fresh, modern chypre. I figured if I love that chypre, I really ought to give Will's chypre a spin some day. And thanks to u/rmic_'s generosity, today was that day.\n\nLGC really is a complex scent. There were moments when I got a lemony note very reminiscent of 42 and other moments where I got a peachy note like Eau de Treget. It's just a magnificent blend of wood and spice and fruit and amazingness. And despite being on it's way to fully phased out, B&M's glissant base still whips up a damn fine lather. Sadly, after spending an entire month using SW, I've noticed a trend of underloading my harder soaps and today was no exception. I'm sure I'll get over it.\n\nHappy Friday, folks!",

I really like the base, but when you have so much stuff to go through, some soaps can get lost in the fray. It was obvious that I need more practice dialing this in, especially with a huge, dense badger brush. Lather was fine, just not to the consistency I like. Slick as hell still. I went with a crazy mix of scents today and it's not all that bad to be honest. The spiciness in FG and Autumn Glory compliment each other quite well. As for Unconditional Surrender, I just felt like using it because it has been a while. It's actually a nice blend. I'm enjoying it.\n\nSo, last night I had the trusty bot roll a number for this PIF. He rolled a lucky number 13 so that makes u/Dank_McDankerson the winner! Congrats! PM me your deets and I'll get this stuff shipped out to you next week. Thanks for playing everybody and Happy Friday all!",

Conversation in IRC regarding scrapey-ness of the GEM and Ever-Ready SE style razors inspired me to use mine for today's shave. Of course I picked up a few nicks around my chin (never fails with my GEM 1912 or with a SR), but haven't seen any scratches from the blade stop like I did last time. This was enjoyable, and every time I hear this song it takes me back to my teenage days driving down PCH to Bolsa Chica and Huntington Beach with friends.\n\nIf you've never tried a GEM 1912, may I introduce you to our friend /u/fuckchalzone and his awesome collection of vintage razors at www.ShaveHQ.com. I picked up this GEM 1912 from him and it's been fun to use ever since.\n\nHappy shaves and hope everyone enjoys their weekend.\n\n.blackcoffee everyone",

I'll perhaps post a review comparison at some point.\n\nAnyways I'm deeply infatuated with the bufala base, it just works for me much better than most. Can't say this one is the best scents I've had from WK but it's pretty decent. Great dried fruit opening and to me it smells sandish however weird that sounds.\n\nAlso galimard is right now one of my favourite scent makers. Any of you in France should check it out but order it online. It's cheaper.",

      "body": "**[Sept. 6, 2019 - Bay Rum Exploration Day Three-Electric Baygaloo](https://imgur.com/VYMfvka)**\n\n\n* **Brush:** Stirling 24mm Boar Brush\n* **Razor:** Merkur 37c Slant\n\n* **Lather:** LA Shaving Soap Co. - Santa Monica Bay Rum\n* **Post Shave:** [Chiseled Face - Bay Rum - Aftershave](https://trythatsoap.com/collection/880/?product_type=aftershave)\n\n\nDay 3 of my Bay Rum showdown is a week late because I have a 10 month old child. So sue me.\n\nBackground: Bay rum, the oldest scent profile in wet shaving, is one of those scents that basically every artisan makes. It's comfortably masculine but sweet and it's extremely old school in the way that pipe tobacco and a smoking jacket make you think of your grandpa. I decided I needed to have at least one of these in my den, but realized that there were so many choices that there must be some kind of variation between them, especially after so many years of dancing around this same scent profile. Anyway, on to today's shave!\n\nToday I used an aftershave I've already rated, Chiseled Face Bay Rum, mostly because I absolutely adore it. Seriously, at 4.2 Cuba Libres it's winning this competition handily so far. But wait--a challenger appears! LASSCO makes one of my favorite scents in all of wetshaving, Blackfern, so I knew I wouldn't be disappointed with any of their fragrance offerings.\n\nLASSCO Santa Monica Bay Rum is supposed to be an ode to Santa Monica (a beach I live about 30 minutes away from) and I definitely feel the love. I want to start by saying that I love the red clay base that this artisan puts out, but I felt the lack of the activated charcoal in the post shave. During the shave, though, the lather slickness and protection are off the charts for a vegan soap. If you haven't yet, give these gents a go.\n\nNow, onto the scent: this one is very spicy in the jar. Heavy allspice and clove, smells like a tradewind in East India Bay. Under lather it opens into warm floral bay, and the minty smell is almost strong enough to taste. For my money, this is the best use of bay so far. Clove and citrus are faint bottom notes on the face if I let it sit for a bit before starting the shave. Overall, extremely enjoyable scent, but I wanted a little more rum in my Bay Rum. I'll rate this one 3.8 Cuba Libres out of 5.\n\nPost is something I've used before, and as stated is the current undefeated heavybayt champion of the world. I want to add to my earlier notes and mention that part of why I love this scent so much is the fact that the menthol scent compliments the sweetness in the heavy rum note, rather than playing against it. I've written about how Caiti's Bubbles barnegat bay smells like vicks vaporub in the jar, and I think this is because the minty bay and stringent menthol don't play nice in liquid form. CF Bay Rum is pleasant from first nose to last whiff of dry down, and that's why it holds on to the top spot at 4.2 Cuba Libres.\n\nNext week I tackle B&M Bay Rum, and spoiler: this stuff smells reaaaal good! Tune in and see if I skip another week due to lack of sleep!",

This was my first shave with it, and I don't really understand why people say it is so aggressive. The blade angle is a little flatter and maybe the exposure a little greater, but I didn't think it was much more aggressive than an 89 head. I'll chalk it up to \"YMMV\".\n\nThe Declaration soap was really nice. It's still new to me and I'm dialing it in. I loaded heavier today and added water more slowly (bowl lather).

In the new tub it's perfectly smooth/flat but upon taking a spoon to it, it gives pretty easily. The scent is definitely on the more masculine side. I wouldn't call it cologne exactly--it feels a bit more rugged, more old school, if that makes sense (?) I could pick up some Vetiver I think. No complaints performance-wise, but I didn't perceive it as a standout in respect to slickness, post-shave, etc. Basically a good soap but perhaps a little pricey vs. comparable peers.\n\nAnd now to the moment that all...err...8 of you have been waiting for: the winner from yesterdays's TT PIF: Congrats to u/shredsofmetal whose guess of 23 came closest to the [RNG's 22](https://imgur.com/Bs1mlGd).

A friend gave it to me\n* **Razor:** Merkur 34c\n* **Blade:** Voskhods\n* **Lather:** Barrister and Mann - Fougère Gothique\n* **Post Shave:** Barrister and Mann - Fougère Gothique\n\nThanks /u/CosmoBarber I borrowed your formatting because I suck at it.\n\nThis was my first time using a real shave soap with a brush... I may be hooked.\n\nUntil now I've been pretty utilitarian in my routine. I only shaved with a shavette and I used Coconut or Olive Oil straight as my prep and my lubrication. It worked excellently for me, but it became stale.\n\nEnter a few days ago. I had just finished a bottle of my favorite cologne and I was introduced to /r/wicked_edge the same day.\nIt was like stumbling upon a world I didn't know existed.\nIt got me thinking about how I'd improve upon my favorite cologne (something I settled on too quickly) and what I ended up with was something completely different. After googling around for a fragrance similar to what I thought up, I came to a 'dark fougère' as a recommendation. At the same time, browsing maggard's, I seen the FG announcement on the homepage. I'd already seen B&M hype so my first soap was settled.\nI was so hyped in fact, I ordered without adding a brush to my cart so a friend gave me a no name brush to use. I'll have to get a brush soon lol.\n\nOh man. I loaded the brush maybe 20 swirls and noticed it was like spider silk or snot. Sticky threads everywhere! I smacked it on my wet face and started doing what I seen in too many YouTube videos, and about a half gallon of added water later (So Much. Water) I looked like the guy on an Arko stick, stupid grin and all.\nIt smelled amazing too. Better than I expected; Exactly what I wanted and then some. The shave was great, no cuts, no irritation, and almost smooth all around.\nHad to shake the aftershave because it was separated, and after putting it on, I didn't know what to expect. I'd never used one before and I wondered how it'd compare to my regular postshave feel. After cleaning up, I rubbed my now dry face and it was pretty damn soft! I loved it. Im definitely a convert. Thanks to everyone here and at W_E for all your help! Awesome communities.",

WTG, XTG, and another XTG clean up. Stirling soap was wonderful to work with. Pleasant scent that actually lasted throughout the day and creamy lather to protect the skin. Brush felt great on the face and had enough lather for all the passes. Razor + blade combo was average. It was a mild shave but slightly rough on the face. I got 4-5 small weepers and slight irritation on my jaw. Mild post shave to wrap it all up.\n\nI was disappointed with the razor. It has a small blade exposure but big blade gap. That gave me a mild but rough shave. This will not be part of my rotation as I did not enjoy the shave. But I still have plenty of other gears to try and experiment with. I will be going back to the Gillette Slim Adjustable for the time being and enjoy my shaves again. I'll be switching up the soap and keep breaking in the SOC boar. It's been a lovely brush so far and I hope it continues to be that way.\n\nAs for mail call, I got couple of injector razors on the way! Also, some really fancy brushes that I get to try out. I really need to enjoy what I have and stop bugging the mailman with all these packages. But still, excited for what's to come!",

Barrister's Reserve Lavender is super slick. Fantastic scent off the puck. Unfortunately, Soap scents don't last on me, and I don't have the aftershave to get the full effect. Good thing my Zingari Man order came a day early. The balm is as good as people have been saying. I did notice that your skin has to be more dry than not for the balm to absorb quickly, where as I've been leaving my skin a little damp for my splashes. Parts of my neck that I didn't dry off completely stayed a little tacky for longer. Looking forward to really get into their soaps after this month.",

It's getting hot as balls early today.\n\nI was entirely correct in yesterdays SOTD post when I blamed my lather issues on the brush. Today I whipped up some shiny, creamy, slippery, snotlike goodness in no time. I also remembered that the tub of SHH! I have is SBS's old formula. Definitly looking forward to using one of their new formula soaps tomorrow.\n\nBroke out the Anne Bonny to show some love to some gear that is feeling a little neglected. As much as I love some of the more complex scents that I have recently been introduced to (Admiral, Le Grand Chypre, etc) to me this is more of a simple, comfort scent. Think dinner at an upscale resturaunt vs. meatloaf at home with the family. Gun to my head, desert island I get one AS, I would definitely give this serious consideration.\n\nHope all of my costal bretheren and/or your families came through Dorian OK.",

I started with a pretty dry brush and nothing happened.

The smoke notes were the main player during the shave. The AS is a little on the sweeter side but also has some smokiness coming through. Overall a good scent that I don't see myself reaching for too often though.\n\nQuality blade today with the Voshkod - first time combo with the Karve. It was a very smooth shave and much better than my last two with the Gillette Super platinum.\n\nDG Lather and the magic hour sang together today - I'm getting the hang of this!\n\nHave a great Sat gang!\n\n*Update* smokiness has dispersed nicely and the sweeter notes are more prevalent. Cl toner really kicks ass - skin is still feeling smooth and soft.",

I know, I restrained myself during the release, and I'm doing it again now for the FG/FA release. Maybe I'll put it on a wish-list and it'll be around for the Christmas exchange.\n\nLife is short, shave with good gear.",

Using the Hybrid Tech for the second time, trying out my first Mammoth soap, and revisiting an old favorite brush.\n\n#### ❧ Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Gillette - Tech Hybrid ::: PolSilver ‹16 uses›)*\n\nAgain, what a great shave. Consistent feel from this solid razor. But don't let the smoothness fool you, it is possible to get a little razor burn from this guy. That just proves that he's aggressive enough to give you a nice close cut!\n\n#### ❧ Soap Notes\n*^(Mammoth Soaps - Shire - Gold Label)*\n\nThem: violets, fresh air, grass, spice, and tobacco\n\nScent: Picked up the fresh air and a little violet and tobacco when on face, but it was very light. But there were times in the process where you got more of a hit of that simple, but sophisticated scent blend. I thoroughly enjoyed it and it is now a permanent part of my collection.\n\nScent Strength: 4/10, lightly present during shaving.\n\nLather: a very good elastic lather that I was able to push a lot of water into. Long stretches of beautiful white stuff! creamy while still staying slick and giving razor superior glide.\n\n* 30 second load with lightly-wet soft badger brush\n* 4 tsp water to build the lather\n* = 5 passes of lather.\n\nMaybe load for 20 sec next time, but really maybe not. Had 1-2 passes left over.\n\nBowl - I used the XL version of this 3D-printable bowl:\nhttps://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3392930\n\n#### ❧ Brush Notes\n*^(Golden Nib - Silvertip Premium 22mm‹32 uses›)*\n\nWith so many good badgers out there, and with me trying some 2-bands lately, today I returned to one of my first and favorite silvertips. Mainly to see if it was too floppy for me. It wasn't. Very nice. Tips not as soft as some of the treated ones, but I'm okay with that.\n\n----\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Smooth\n*Neck*: Smooth\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Few hairs are showing some tip length (with most being cut flush)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm) *and also in the sub's sidebar.*\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

Harris - Sandalwood - Cream](https://trythatsoap.com/collection/263/?product_type=cream)\n* **Post Shave:** [D.R. Harris - Sandalwood - Aftershave](https://trythatsoap.com/collection/263/?product_type=aftershave)\n\n\nFirst off, notes from yesterday. I was able to get a good smell off a palm lather last night. Overwhelmingly cedarwood. Like the TOBS, I couldn't find the sandalwood at all, but like u/kaesees said, the preformance of this cream is great.\n\nNow, on to today's shave. This is a very cologne like sandalwood to me. There are a lot of things going on in the background with this soap. The scent list from the maker lists Eucalyptus, Bergamot, Camphor, Clove and Vetiver, in addition to Sandladwood. I could still pick the sandalwood out, but it was difficult. The soap performance was top notch, with just a bit of tightness on the post shave.\n\nThis first week of Sandalwood September has been fun. I'll be changing up the hardware tomorrow and changing gears from creams into soaps (mostly) for the next week. The choice to use creams this week was kind of by happenstance. I tried to grab sandalwood soaps that people may have been more familiar with, rather than diving right into artisan makers. This kind of gives me a place to start comparing scents as I move through the month. I'm looking forward to next week's shaves.\n\nI hope everyone has a great weekend.",

What an amazing vegan soap base. This soap really exceeded my expectations. It has wonderful primary and residual slickness, and the high aloe content of both the soap and alcohol free splash make for a stellar post shave experience as well.\n\nAs for the scent, it's floral forward which isn't typically my thing, but the earthy and wet ozone and dirt notes really balance the florals quite effectively. To me, it smells like a mid-strong wisteria with wet and decaying leaves and red wine in the background. Truly an interesting, pleasant and very unique scent indeed.\n\nHope you all are doing well and are having some great shaves!",

If I asked a perfumer to make a scent that said standing in a field on a nice spring day and they came back with anything other than this they would be wrong. It is a very clean and fresh scent. Not overpowering but light and pleasant to the nose. It's not for date nightbut it would be a great daily work week soap, the kind of scent you wear so often that to those that get close to you, its part of your identity. In my den this is a soap that will get used frequently and for runs of 3-5 days. If SBS ever plans on discontinuing this scent I will definitly grab an extra bottle of AS and a tub or two of soap. Great post shave feel as usual, face is soft and smooth.\n\nEdit - I got my FA/FG in yesterday. Is there any one else here who thinks that the FA label image would make a great tattoo. So emamored with it I may have to PM Will and see if he has any spare labels laying around he could part with.",

Back to back weekend days in the office as we prep for trial starting tomorrow morning. I don't want to smell **too** good so as to distract my co-counsel.\n\nIt's stressful days (weeks?) like this that I really appreciate wetshaving hobby. It forces me to slow down in the morning. It's almost meditative and I'm convinced it reduces stress. Maybe more so on days like today when I pull out my Gillette Aristocrat 46/47 which gives me consistently the smoothest shaves of any of my razors regardless of age.\n\nI had some irritation on my neck yesterday so I pulled out Myrsol Metisol and it really calmed things down nicely. The alum, potassium, and thyme extract is incredibly soothing. As always, Stirling's balm left my face soft and smooth.\n\nHope to be able to sneak away to watch a few snaps of football as well. Go Lions!",

      "body": "**2019-09-08 SOTD: Special Anniversary Shave Spectacular**\n\n**Razor:** 1961 Flare Tip Super Speed\n\n**Blade:** Wilkinson Sword, German (shave #1)\n\n**Brush:** Vie Long 21mm Horse Hair (VL-14080)\n\n**Lather:** Mother Effin' Fuckin' Cella\n\n**Post:** Nivea Sensitive Skin After Shave Balm\n\n**Thoughts:**\n\nAs I perused my shave journal last month, I noticed a strange synchronicity of events that would occur today, September 8 2019. Today marks:\n\n- My 100th consecutive day shaving - no missed days since May!\n\n- My 200th shave with a safety razor!\n\n- My 20th year of applying an assortment of wet goops and sharp blades to my face with varying degrees of success!\n\nSuch a momentus coincidence cannot be overlooked, so not only am I using a special setup today but I'm also [PIFing a brush](https://old.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/d1bdvg/ussspongebobs_canadian_pif_it_forward_eh/) (as I [hinted on Thursday](https://old.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/czxwqv/theme_thursday_sotd_thread_sep_05_2019/ez4lx0q/)).\n\nToday's setup features the first pieces of gear that made me go \"Oh - shaving can actually be a nice thing and *doesn't have to suck every time.*\" The Super Speed + Wilkinson combo was an improvement for me over the comfort and efficiency of my Edwin Jagger DE89 + Derby combo. The Vie Long brush + Cella were a big step up over brushless shaving creams in comfort both during and after the shave. The aftershave balm... actually, I had already been using that for close to 20 years so no change there.\n\nWhat do I think of this setup now, 8 months after it set a new standard for a comfortable shave?\n\nThe razor and blade are just fine. I still like 'em. Damn near BBS with very little effort, though the Gillette doesn't quite live up to my Fatip. Cella is still one of my favorite soaps. Nivea is still my go-to balm when I fuck my face up and can't risk an alcohol splash. The only thing I'm not a fan of any more is the Horse brush because it almost always gives me brush burn... too scritchy for me and my delicate baby skin. I absolutely love the knot size and the ergonomics of the handle though. Those aspects are pretty much perfect for me. I'm pretty tempted to pull the knot and put in a little 20mm badger or synth or something.\n\nAnyway, it's neat to look back on the things we thought were groundbreaking when we started and see if they still hold up to modern scrutiny with a more practiced & experienced perspective.",

I loaded directly from the tub which led to a bit of overloading and an explosion of lather. I love non-traditional barbershop scents and this one is really fantastic. I get more of the sage note from the soap and the aftershave smells fantastic. I paired it with some VoA EdP to keep with today's Southern Witchcrafts theme.\n\nThe blade felt much better in the Rockwell 2C using the 3 plate.

Better feeling shave today, but I was interrupted mid way through with a face full of lather by a poopy baby diaper and didn't feel like subsequent passes were properly hydrated.\n\nThere's one spot on my neck that always feels a bit of catching no matter which direction I shave (other than directly WTG) and today was no exception. I would like to figure out how to best handle this spot.",

It *is* a damn good razor and I *did* get a damn fine shave today.\n\nThe B3 Theo came to me in a swap, not a PIF. I traded my Wild West Brushworks B3 for a full Declaration model. That Wild West B3 may have been one of the softer B3s floating around. Until I got the Theo, I had never truly experienced the scritch that people talk about when they discuss B3. This B3 definitely has more scritch and scrub than the WW. I think much like the WW B3, the Theo will primarily be used for head shaves.\n\nSimilarly, the Helios Scale Polish is another bit of shave gear that really only gets used on my head. If I try to put this stuff on my face, the menthol goes straight to my eyes. But on my dome, it's wonderful.",

It's a limited edition. From an Italian shave group, I'm guessing on the book of faces. It was loaned to me from a buddy local to me, he used to post here but has long stopped doing so.\n\nAnyhow, the scent is VERY Italian. Not in the marzipan/almond scent way, more in the cologne scent stylings. It smells like a mild Saponificio Varesino scent, but not, if that makes sense. It's really nice!\n\nLathering was also very similar to many Italian soft soaps. My brush was a little more wet than it should have been, but wasn't *too* foamy, but I could tell this soap would like it to be a dryer brush to load. The end result was just fine. The lather was a little on the thin side, which I *think* lends itself well to straight razor shaving. I'll use it again soon and change up technique to see if it changes the lather at all.\n\nSince it's my first use, I'll reserve my thoughts about the shave. That said, I enjoyed it! DFS for me and it's gorgeous out!\n\nHope everyone is having a great weekend!",

WTG, XTG, and another XTG clean up. Cella gave for a creamy and slick lather that lasted throughout the whole shave. Great marzipan almond scent as well. Brush worked well and exfoliated the skin, maybe too roughly. The supervisor knot has a lot of backbone and a lot of resistance; good for rough skins but not a daily driver. Razor + blade felt slightly rough in the first pass but great for the rest. I am throwing the blade away as it is getting rougher on the skin. Mild post shave to wrap it up.\n\nNext shave, I'll be featuring a similar setup but back with the SOC. Also, I have couple soaps to feature for the channel as well as some SE razors and new brushes. I am thinking of getting a hybrid knot brush in the near future, maybe next month or the month after. Anyways, excited to use the SOC again!",

I really should find something else; it shouldn't be hard with the skills and experience I have, but leaving this stability is scary. I've got a wife and 2 young ones at home that depend on me having a steady paycheck (not to mention good health benefits). But I'm starting to miss out on a lot of things now, both fun little things and big developmental milestones with my kids. My son will be walking any day now, and I'll probably miss it because I'll either be catching up on sleep...or working again. Don't even get me started about the strain working 80 hour night shifts puts on a marriage, or my health. All little GingerBredBeard wanted to be when he grew up was a Major League Baseball Player...now, I'm just a chubby and balding IT guy.\n\nOh well, that's enough of me bitching about being a gainfully employed, middle class American. Time to rest up and make up for lost time. Have a good one my dudes.",

I can see why this head design is so popular. This one is even more mild than the standard 0.95, which is actually kind of nice. Folks here compared it to a Karve A, but for me it was more like Karve B or Rockwell 6S on R2. The shave was comfortable and enjoyable. No nicks or irritation. Not quite BBS but a very good DFS. But as with the R2 on my 6S, I think I can get a nice BBS with some more practice. The craftsmanship is really lovely too.",

The scent seems to be more on the drier side of the spectrum and very mild. The scent strength isn't strong off of the puck, but it's definitely noticeable. I'd never used this soap before, so I didn't know what to expect about the scent or performance. I really like the scent of this soap, and the performance was great.",

I don't have a dark scent nor lavender so I don't have anything to compare it to. The soap, though lavender is there, is a deep, rich, kinda earthy. I'm guessing it's what would be expected with the scent notes listed. I've found the more I smell it, the more I like it. The aftershave slightly more lavender forward than the soap but still has a great complex profile. I can't wait to use this more throughout this week and get more acquainted with it.\n\nSummer Break Soaps have great products, definitely one of my favorites.",

Some of you may remember my kidney stone from Labor Day. Guess what: I didn't pass it that day. I went to work the next day and made it halfway through before I had to get my wife to come get me like a little bitch. Fuck a kidney stone. Those things suck ass. Then, in the midst of all that pain, I came down with the first upper respiratory infection I've had since I quit smoking over a year and a half ago. Needless to say, I haven't felt like shaving at all. Today was my first tip toeing back into things and I used some samples that Maggard so graciously sent me after the slight MLS fiasco. They sold me a tub of Kraken they didn't have, so they asked if they could take a shitton of samples and press into an empty jar, thereby giving me an extra two ounces. Hell yeah I agreed!! Then, to further kick ass like they do, they sent me a couple of samples of things like the EJ that I'd otherwise never try. Fuck yeah for Maggard! I finally decided to try the EJ stuff because it's nice and lightly scented and I'm not quite 100% yet. Worked well enough. Not great, but not terrible. Of course I mixed in a dollop of Cryogen and actually used a bit of the matching aftershave before I used the lotion, but that doesn't count imo. I'm not a huge cream guy, but this was better than Proraso for me. Not quite as drying. Anyway, happy Monday folks!",

In this vein, this week starts the beginning of a personal journey to be more mindful and put the Stoic philosophy into practice. To begin, I'm reading a page from The Daily Stoic each morning, journaling on how I can put the daily lesson into practice, and then in the evening meditating and writing some more to reflect on how the day went... as of yesterday, I'm one day in and so far, so good.\n\nContemplation by Declaration Grooming may have been a more appropriate soap to use (in name), but today's shave gives me the musical and olfactory inspiration to be mindful of my world and do what's necessary to achieve my goals. As William Wrnest Henley wrote in his poem *Invictus*, [\"I am the master of my fate / I am the captain of my soul.\"](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/51642/invictus)\n\n\nHave a great week folks.",

I'm going to call this 90% BBS other than some patches that I left from just missing them on my clean-up. Did WTG/XTG/ATG and just a couple of touch-ups in the ATG phase. Found a good face to make to better get my chin and under it. I LOOK stupid when I do it but it flattens out the area there really nicely so I'ma keep up with it. Nobody knows what I do in shave time anyways so I can make whatever face I want to.\n\nReally amazed that this tub is showing the bottom already. Time has been flying for sure because it feels like I only got it a month or so ago versus a full 3 months ago.\n\nHad a great weekend, getting stuff done around the house here and there. Cooked some badass shrimp on the grill for lunch yesterday and home made pizza for dinner (I made mine as salami pizza which is IMO the most underrated pizza topping) so the eats were definitely good.\n\nAight for today there's something you've been needing that you're not getting. Time with someone, your voice to be heard, recognition for you work, time to yourself, etc. Something. Go figure out what it is. Getting it comes next but for now just figure it out.\n\nHappy Monday.",

First impressions of the soap (thanks again to /u/Fahrenheit915 btw!):\n* the base lathers very quickly, and has excellent slickness. More dense than voluminous, though that might have changed if I worked it longer. As received, the base was firmer than expected.\n* the soap and aftershave smell nearly identical. I get a lot of leather followed by some cedar (a true cedar note); I haven't been able to pick out other individual notes yet, though there's clearly more going on. It's a pleasant scent for sure; between the name and the smellz it brings the idea to mind that I'm opening a treasure chest full of pirate booty.\n* the aftershave is good skin food. The feel is somewhat different from alcohol - with this I get no sting on the initial application, a tiny bit after maybe ten or fifteen seconds, some slight tingling around the 45 second mark, then nothing after a minute or so.\n\nMy plan is to shave with this soap & splash all week, then write up a real review - the only two reviews I found when searching were two years old, and one had more than half the comments deleted due to some stupid argument over the artisan's name.",

Silversmith is indeed a pleasure and worked reasonably well with mid sharpness Bolzano. The SS does better with somewhat sharper blades, but the Bolzano is more than adequate for a 7-9 hour BBS after two passes.\n\nThat said, the Bolzie gave a bit less than BBS today, suggesting it might be nearing the end of its service.\n\n**Lather:** Fougere Angelique arrived in time for yesterday's shave, and so I used FG today as a counterpoint. The smoke and ashes notes in FG are truly more apparent after FA, as is the geranium and mushroom. FG seemed a bit more complex to my nose today, probably from the very proximal FA usage.\n\n**Brush:** The Manchurian bulb has evolved from a Thater-like lather hog to being reliable in loading and distribution. The trim looking bulb looks and feels great, and the heavy stone handle is one of the favorites in my collection.\n\n**Frag**: Has Azzaro PH been reformulated several times in the last few years? Not sure. This bottle is about 4 years old, and was dirt cheap. Now the same bottle costs thrice as much. and one rumor I've heard is that Azzaro did a reformulation to add potency and value to the allegedly sadly deficient recent version (the one I have) which was described as being an atrocious dumbing down of the vintage (80s/ 90s) version of the scent.\n\nI have no idea. I like the bottle I have, admire its potency and complexity, and cannot imagine paying three times as much for a new version that _might_ be better. Call me an olfactory hobbit if you will, but I intend to sit right here by the fire and warm my hairy toes as I emit occasional wafts of the perfectly adequate APH. circa 2016.",

I used it for the entire month of August last year and I don't know that I've used it all that much since, but it is a *great* shaver. I was not a fan of the Gillette Platinum blade on my previous shave, but in the Fatboy, it just zipped right through the whiskers. I suppose it just goes to show that the right pairing of razor and blade can make all the difference.\n\nOn the Edwin Jagger brush, I find I am just completely spoiled by the density of Declaration and SHD knots. This brush just feels thin and floppy and it has just a hint of scritch.\n\nSonder, as always, is a wonderful scent and it pairs well with the SMN Eva. Together they remind me that on this rainy day there is still sunshine somewhere.\n\nGood shaves, all. Just a couple more weeks until it's officially autumn and all of our soaps turn into Samhain and Darkfall.",

This is a superior razor head, for sure.\n\n#### ❧ Soap Notes\n*^(Southern Witchcrafts - Desairology)*\n\nThem: Desairology, named for the mortuary practice of grooming the dead, is a spooky twist on classic barbershop scents.\n\nNotes: Sandalwood, musk, oakmoss, citrus, lavender, vanilla, oud, burnt white sage, burnt palo santo, gardenia\n\nScent: Vanilla, musk, and sage were the strongest players to my nose. The rest were distant supporters. I would say that you need to like vanilla a lot to like this soap, and from the AS I tried a week or two ago, even moreso, because the Vanilla is stronger there. It is a vanilla with some interest, or variation, or a twist, but it is still very vanilla.\n\nScent Strength: 6/10, nicely present during shaving.\n\nLather: Fine one. This base was so good! Outrageously slick and protective. Creamy, luxurious rinses, and the razor head was gliding across my face like a 1980s Russian figure skater. I may not be enough of a vanilla fan for this scent, but holy cow, /u/phteven_j, you guys have made an amazing base!\n\n* 20 sec load with lightly-wet, badger brush\n* 4 tsp water\n* = 6 passes of lather.\n\n\nBowl - I used the XL version of this bowl:\nhttps://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3392930\n\n#### ❧ Brush Notes\n*^(Maseto - Memphis Silvertip 24mm‹14 uses›)*\n\nThis one is more dense than my TGN silvertip, but to be fair, the tgn is 22mm. The density gave it a little more backbone, which I was missing from the 22mm TGN. A very very enjoyable brush.\n\n----\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Smooth\n*Neck*: Smooth\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Few hairs are showing some tip length (with most being cut flush)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm) *and also in the sub's sidebar.*\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

      "body": "**Posting this, a second entry for today.** This is the one for today. The other was from previous day.\n\n----\n\n*Razor*: **Karve - Christopher Bradley** (OC D Plate)\n*Blade*: **Personna - 74 (Tungsten)** (3)\n*Lather*: **Declaration Grooming** Icarus - **Nefertiti**\n*Brush*: **Stirling - Finest CravingtShaving Blue Slate** 26mm (14 uses)\n*Post*: Barrister and Mann - Reserve Fougere Gothique\n\n----\n\n[Gear Pic](https://imgur.com/PqQTkNe) :: [Video](https://youtu.be/wHgGycjvZ9I)\n\n#### ❧ General Notes / TL;DR\n**Magical shave** today. The CB was sliding across my skin, mowing down stubble like a ninja in the middl eof the night. It was smooth and nutty good.\n\nI also tried Nefertiti, which is not bad, but isn't for me, since there are just so many soaps that I like better out there.\n\nI did notice something on the FG AS today.... a note of fir, pine, or some other conifer with maybe a clove spice to it or something. If this was brought out by the Nefertiti, then it might be okay, but if I get a hit of this next time, I may have to pass that on. I don't notice that in the soap, but it was here in the AS and is not my thing. And why is it that the AS notes we *don't* like are the ones that stay with us for so long. I'm talking hours here, folks.\n\n#### ❧ Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Karve - Christopher Bradley OC D Plate ::: Personna - 74 - Tungsten ‹3 uses›)*\n\nI just shaved with a Hybrid Tech yesterday, and this one beat it out. How about that world!\n\nSome complain, but I have never noticed the brass smell in this razor.\n\nThis D OC plate is so nice. I can't believe it shaved this well. And with no irritation.\n\nI can't handle the E in solid bar, but it looks like I'll be ordering the E OC plate in a month or two because the D was so good I have to see what happens if I take one more step.\n\n#### ❧ Soap Notes\n*^(Declaration Grooming Icarus - Nefertiti)*\n\nThem: Honey, orchid leaf, jasmine, kyphi incense, jazz cigarettes, oud, vetiver, musk.\n\nScent: The Jasmine was strong, but the femininity of this one is muted by the other ingredients. I can see how some guys might want to shave with this. Esp if the florals that are there remind them of their childhood or such. But there are just too many manly scents out there to have this one in my den.\n\nScent Strength: 4/10, lightly present during shaving.\n\nLather: super slick, not that creamy-thick, but still a delight to use. Maybe I would not want to go any wetter than this.\n\n* 20 sec load with lightly wet, but dense, badger\n* 4 tsp water to build lather\n* = 5 passes\n\nBowl - I used the XL version of this bowl:\nhttps://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3392930\n\n#### ❧ Brush Notes\n*^(Stirling - Finest in CravingShaving Blue Slate 26mm‹14 uses›)*\n\nThis one is a bit dense for me, but I'm hoping more uses will relax him.\n\n----\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Smooth\n*Neck*: Smooth\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Cut flush to where I just see the tips (above average for me)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm) *and also in the sub's sidebar.*\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

I also found out over the weekend that The Trail will no longer be produced :( I was really hoping for an EdT of this one, honestly. It's such a fantastic blend of pine and sage with notes like juniper, oakmoss, lavender, and other woodsy notes in a supporting role.\n\nI brought a few Chatillon Lux travel-sized fragrances along with me and decided on Omnostre today. It's a great scent too. I get a lot of vetiver and musk initially, but there are other notes in there as well. It's a complex scent, so I need to give it some time to process it all.",

Funny how things are all relative b/c compared the Arko, I thought the Fine soap was actually quite slick (and as I said, I got a great result even from the Arko). Sadly, I exhausted the remainder of my Fine Fresh Vetiver splash sample, so I will now be on the hunt for a full bottle to pair with the rest of the soap. If anyone has one they want to move, pm me.",

I started with the lowest plate I have, which is D plate. Lots of blade feel, but I will reserve judgement for another shave or two. I will not be trying E and F.\n\nOverall a decent shave, but after two passes it looked like I hadn't shaved my neck yet. I did two more diagonal against/across passes to clean things up. Very light pressure the whole shave.\n\nI continue to enjoy Samhain, and my sample is nearly gone but it looks like it will stretch for one more. Remarkable.\n\nFirst try of the Zingari balm as well. It's good stuff. Will wait to reserve final judgement for a few more uses.",

WTG, XTG, and another XTG clean up. Soap worked well; creamy and slick lather with good residual slickness for protection. One of my favorite soaps. Brush felt great and made a ton of lather to last for the entire shave. Razor + blade combo felt good. Mild and efficient setup but there was something missing. I am not sure why but a bit of stability was missing from the shave. It might be the light plastic handle but overall, I enjoyed it.\n\nI'll be continuing a similar setup for the rest of this week. Meanwhile, I got the set of Razorock Hawks to shave with! They look great and somewhat aggressive. The long heads makes it seem like a quick shave. I am excited to try these out next week. I'll probably start with V1, the silver hawk. Also, I have couple brushes on the way that I am stoked for. Also, my first custom brush process is starting! Fun times in the wet shaving world.",

This is a great scent that is quickly becoming a favorite. The base works very well for me, easy to lather and very slick. I got a Discovery set from Mancera the other day, so I'm trying to incorporate what I can into my SOTD. Gatsby has notes of Citrus, Vetiver and Cedar which seemed to match up well with the given notes of Vetiver, Cedar and Mandarin Orange on Wind Wood. Wind Wood starts off with a very brief top end of citrus, but quickly gives way to the Pink Pepper. I was worried the Pepper would take over like it does in Viking by Creed, but it soon transitions to a great leather accord with a more green Vetiver scent in the background. The dry down is delightful blend of Violet and Cedar. This one also a hit with the lady friend, so that's always a plus!",

Tonsorial Parlour is a scent I enjoyed from first contact. If anything it just keeps getting better.\n\nCB's Chris Cullen is scheduled to attend the shave meetup in Greensboro NC in a couple of weeks. I am looking forward to actually putting the nose to a variety of products rather than settling for scent notes on the interwebs. Rumors have it that a certain youtube shave celeb from \"beautiful North Carolina\" (or is it Beautiful, North Carolina?) will be in the house.",

Still working on killing this Nekromantik set and I'm happy (and unhappy) to report that it's got 3 small holes in the bottom of the soap. Using it once or twice a day for a while will surely kill it quickly. It was refreshing once again to add the smidgeon of Cryogen to both the soap and aftershave. Trying to kill this set as well so I can start on my frost drops.\n\n\nI'm about to hafta go take my wife to work. Ugh. I got out of my truck at her bakery yesterday mornin and everything was fine. Got back in it and tried to shift it into reverse and I felt something weird in the gear shift. The truck then refused to shift out of park. Yay! I stressed about it all day yesterday and googled stuff and watched YouTube videos. I got back to it after I got off work and come to find out, it's a small plastic bushing that goes on the end of the gearshift cable where it attaches to the gear shift. The fucker just disintegrated! The problem now is just to find one locally. Autozone didn't have one in stock and \"might have one come in around 3 today on the truck\". Might? Gimme a damn break! O'Reilly's here was no better. They wanted to try to just give me a retaining clip that's not even the same size and told me to \"just wiggle it around until it works\". Holy shit that's dumb. So I'm sending my wife to the locally owned parts store in town that was closed by the time I figured this out yesterday. The guy that owns it was my grandfather's best friend and I know he won't screw me when it comes to this. I'm just thankful though that it was something small that I can actually fix myself!",

First up, Stirling Soaps South Padre. The soap needs no introduction as I'm pretty sure everybody here has used it. Heck, I'm pretty sure everybody here has at least one tub in their den. If you don't, I'm going to wonder WTH is wrong with you and do you even wet shave bro? Not having it is like calling yourself a chef and having no salt and pepper in your spice rack.\n\nThe scent, hands down, is my favorite Stirling scent. It is probably unfamiliar to most of you as Rod stopped making it two(?) years ago due to lack of interest. Makes this possibly my only set of unobtainium (MLS Pantie Dropper may be my second but I'm pretty sure there is still a set or two hiding somehere online). The scent opens with blood orange and is quickly followed buy a touch of coconut. It is literaly, not figuratively but literaly, the scent of my childhood trips to the beach. The only thing missing is the sand and the occasioal whiff of dead sea creature. If you are familliar with A&E's ST. Barts it is the complimentary opposite of South Padre with the coconut opening and the madarin following. I often pair the Stirling soap with the A&E aftershave - I wish to die having spent my last dollar and wearing my last drop of South Padre AS.",

The Super Speed has less face-feel with the blade and I think it's a great beginner-friendly razor to get folks into wet shaving, but it struggles to get a good BBS finish ATG on my moustache zone. The Fatip open comb certainly requires a little more finesse, but I think it's more efficient and it does a better job under my nose sans irritation.\n\nI've always thought of Cella being a quick-lathering soap, and I mean, it sort of is? It starts producing a frothy lather extremely easily and quickly and then works down into an inconsistently textured foam with a bit of work, and in that regard it's fast. The results aren't great if I shave with it that way, though, and I get much better results when I put in the same kind of time and elbow grease that I would give the thirstier artisan soaps (like DG Bison or or B&M Reserve).\n\nI think the same could be said of several commercial soaps, including Proraso and Mitchell's (and William's, which I haven't tried but heard many accounts of last month). They all produce a quick frothy lather that looks nice on camera but still requires a lot more water and effort before they're really slick and ready to shave with. I wonder if part of the reason they get such a bad reputation is because most people use them when they're first starting out and they don't know what kind of work is required for a good lather, and they never revisit these soaps with proper technique once they've transitioned to the artisan market?\n\nI'm not saying that these four bases are on the same tier as the current crop of artisan soaps, but I also don't think they are as bad as many of us make them out to be. (Well. Maybe the Williams is as bad as it's made out to be. Maybe.)",

This is a wonderful smell and definitely captures the scent of money well. The lather is fantastic and is definitely a little easier to lather than the Colonel though I need to try him with a different brush and see how that goes. This is my first shave with a Storybook Soapworks base and it's wonderful. Easy to lather and very slick.\n\nAlso, a shout out to Rob from That Darn Rob. Rob has been wonderful to work with. For those of you who missed the saga, I was lucky enough to purchase one of his hybrids but had a crack develop during use with it. We tried a repair but that was unsuccessful. Rob worked to replace the cracked brush and created the absolutely stunning hybrid in the photo.\n\nAnyway hope everyone has a wonderful day, and, for those of you chasing Mammoth Soaps, good luck.",

I don't need 5 different GIT inspired soaps, one good one is fine and the rest of the artisans can focus on original scents or other dupes of lesser know scents.\n\nThe Nacet feels much better in the Slim Adjustable.

Not so much because it was showing any signs of failure as because our last bookshelf collapsed and it has made us paranoid. Anyways, the first step was to re-nail the back paneling, and I think I did as good a job as possible putting new finishing nails in quietly because I didn't wake any of our kids. The next step was to drill and screw the piece of 1/2 MDF that I got as backing to add rigidity to the bookshelf, and therein lay the problem - when I lay everything down, it became apparent that I had had the thing cut about 5/8\" too narrow! So I had to unwind the project and put all the books back in shame, and now I get to think for a while of how I'm going to cut this roughly 71\" by 31\" MDF into 31\"x31.625\" strips to halfassedly accomplish the original goal.\n\nOn the shave front, though, everything just clicked today. I loaded about 40 seconds and face lathered and was really rewarded with dense, slick, quality stuff. It felt like I could do no wrong with the blade, with the exception of a close call due to a placement error right at the juncture of my earlobe and jaw on the right side. The cedar in both the soap and splash seemed more prominent today. My wife said she could smell the gunpowder, but she's never smelled gunpowder (except from fireworks maybe? not sure if they still use blackpowder) so I'm unsure if that's what she was picking up. The sensation vs time curve for the toner is very different from an alcohol splash, and pretty similar to what I used to get from balms when I used them regularly.",

The Indian Summer of Bolzie!\n\n**Brush:** A stunningly good brush for less than $20. Big yet precise, the efficiency of a synth with the warmth retention of a badger. All this in an attractive and comfortable handle.\n\n**Lather:** Another stunning success from a brand that is boringly perfect. Ho hum, another creative and perfectly executed scent from B&M in the best base in wet shaving. B&M = NE Patriots of shaving, only without the assholes and occasional cheating.\n\nThe dark and raunchy scent of FG is perfectly lightened with a triple citrus blast. The end result is a citrus scent with weight and depth, a perfect Fall scent and one that makes the shaver strive to perceive all the myriad notes in the composition.\n\nPackaging is well done, as always. What was the sin that caused the angels to fall from Heaven? Shakespeare said it was Ambition, but theologians commonly attributed the angelic downfall to Pride. (Ambition not really being a Deadly Sin and all, but this is where the term \"poetic license\" comes into play...)\n\n**Post:** A perfect scent complement to FA, and a very effective yet economical post shave formula. If it had a tad more menthol, I would be happier, but that's just what I say for virtually every shaving scent.... (B&M Terror excluded. That has quite enough coolant as configured!)\n\n**Frag**: Xeryus' warm weather sibling. Tarragon, cactus, and pepper make for a weird vegetal sweet semi-gourmand. Not as complex or heavy as the original Xeryus, but still not at all a lightweight. Undoubtedly one of the most interesting flankers in the history of fragrance, and a great way to celebrate the waning days of summer.",

It's final, my puck is done. It's kind of funny - this puck was the one I started with in February and it's taken me this long to finishing. It was realistically finished back in May, but then when I ordered it's replacement (WK King of Oud) I slowed my use of it. Today I scooped the last of it out and bowl lathered it up for a GREAT final shave with this particular 4 oz of heaven.\n\nTech and the Gillette Green are really a fab combo - still my blade of choice though I have a few more to test out before I lock in on it and order a bunch of greenies. I can't tell any real difference between pre- and post- war Tech which isn't surprising. I've been changing blades and soaps around since I flopped over to the Post-War. Really happy with them both.\n\nFeeling a bit frustrated with some of the stuff going on at work, but that's what the check is for. I had hoped we were getting to a better place with our processes but seems there are still some folks that just can't look at the future until they know who to blame for the past. Oh well, it's all good.\n\nAlright here's your mission for today if you choose to accept it. You might not know it but someone in your life is just DYING for a high five. Find the one who needs it most and expects it least and lay one on em. Ok? Solid.\n\nHave a great Tuesday all you beautiful groomers.",

Yesterday was a busy morning and over the weekend I just didn't. This post is a little late.\n\nNot sure how but today I took longer than normal shaving. Just one of those days where you wake up and feel like you are moving in slow motion it time is flying. So I changed blades and stuck with the slant head because I never tried any other blades in it. I bought some Astras awhile ago just to try them and they really tugged at my hair. This time however there were no issues. Not sure if it's the razor or my technique but result was fine. As for the soap, the base is excellent and it makes your skin feel great afterwards. The scent has grown on me and I wish I bought more than just a sample size of the aftershave. Have a great day everyone!",

Man balm, SBS Field Day\n\n\nBeen a few days since my last shave and I dove into this one because my neck was getting itchy. Didn't have my Karve with me so used the Rockwell with a new Voshkod blade. Lather was good too but the overall shave didn't quite feel right. The razor was not as smooth as I've come to expect with SBS - I suspect my lather could have used a touch more water.\n\n2 pass to get rid of the long hairs and I didn't quite reach my usual end result.\n\nNow for the AS - my rush with the shave was because I'm packing for a trip, but I did have some time to apply a few products. First up was witch hazel (didn't have Thayers) - the high concentrate stuff with some water added. Felt good. Then Stirling balm - felt okay and ended with the Field Day AS. Overall, this didn't feel any better than the last few shaves of Thayers/AS used together. And some might be due to how smooth your shave is or the post-shave slickness of the soap.\n\nOne more day until vacation. Have a great Tuesday folks!",

The scent is light and refreshing with just enough citrus to keep it fresh. A near perfect match for Island man. I do think the Bonaire/ Island man scent is a little further away from Creed Virgin Island Water than the A&E St. Barts take on it. Creed and St. Barts are both warmer with a more creamy overall scent and very subtle citrus notes. I think I like Island man/ Bonaire better. But every take on this scent I have tried is great!",

You can't make everybody happy, right. Or even one guy. In any case - this is good. I'm excited to smell the EdP on release, this is my type of scent. Fall soaps are the best soaps.

First I tried Nivea, then Arko, and now Palmolive courtesy of a PIF from u/VisceralWatch. I would rate Nivea and Palmolive as fairly similar in terms of consistency of lather/slickness, with Arko being lower structure and less residual slickness. Only quibble with today's shave was that I had barely enough lather for 3 passes, but that is probably more attributable to the brush--next time I'll try a synthetic. Fortunately, I didn't need more than 3 passes with the GC .84, a very efficient razor. Dry down on Game reminds me a lot of Fine American Blend--not necessarily my favorite scent note but I do appreciate the nice performance for the price point. Anyway, I think, I'm sold on Palmolive as a travel soap--very compact, quick, and efficient.",

Trying out the new-to-me NEW Flat Bottom Round Pin as well as Stirling's fairly recent Ramblin' Man.\n\n#### ❧ Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Gillette - NEW Flat Bottom Round Pin Knurled - UK ::: Personna - 74 - Tungsten ‹4 uses›)*\n\nA very efficient combo. This razor starts out feeling pretty good. Then during the second pass, I notice that I'm getting a couple of spots of razor burn. This one might be a little too efficient to be a daily shaver for me, at least with this blade.\n\n#### ❧ Soap Notes\n*^(Stirling - Ramblin' Man)*\n\nThem: Citrus, Sandalwood, Musk, Cedar, Ambergris\n\nScent: This one is zesty citrus and is not shy about it. Maybe some of that zest is part musk or ambergris, I don't know. But I didn't pick up any sandalwood, and the citrus (talking about the soap and AS here) stayed dominant the whole time. A little too much for me, especially since I'm usually a night shaver. This one will help to wake you up in the morning!\n\nIt really reminded me of Baker Street. So if that's a favorite of yours, and you want a variation, then maybe get a sample of this guy.\n\nScent Strength: 6/10, very present during shaving.\n\nLather: Within the realm of a really nice lather today, just on the wet side of that range. This dense brush didn't really help. Excellent performance, though. Slick glide today.\n\n* 20 second load with a lightly-wet, dense 2-band badger brush\n* 4 tsp water to build the lather\n* = 4 passes of lather\n\nBowl - I used the XL version of this bowl:\nhttps://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3392930\n\n#### ❧ Brush Notes\n*^(Stirling - Finest in CravingShaving Blue Slate 26mm‹15 uses›)*\n\nYeah, still not liking this knot nearly as much as my Maggard SHD or my Elite Manch, but that's kinda as it should be, since those cost a lot more. This guy is just so dense that it's a ball of soft tips. I would still enjoy it if I were trapped without another brush to use.\n\nOne of the things about this one is that because it is so dense, a stirring motion in the bowl doesn't get thesoap much into the middle of the knot. And if you forget that, then when you put knot to face, then the soap is gone and you're just dry scrubbing. Very disconcerting when you're expecting luxurious slick lather. I just have to remember that I need to jam it down into the lather several times and that will inject the lather into the center and change the experience very much for the better.\n\nI also thing this guy may be a prime candidate for testing the backbone of bulb vs fan. Inexpensive, but soft. Some day I'll get the fan version and compare.\n\n----\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Cut flush to where I just see the tips (above average for me)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm) *and also in the sub's sidebar.*\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

I was losing lather left and right but still had enough for 3 passes. An unscented balm so I could get a better understanding of Cool Water. My wife thinks that I acquired it when she ordered Cool Water for Men by mistake instead of for Women. I've read it has a similar vibe to GIT, which I can see. I can't explain why, but I sense a similarity.\n\nLife is short, shave with good gear.",

Initially, while the soap is still soft you have to be very careful not to overload it. I have a couple of tubs that are older and that have dried, and I was having difficulty loading the soap. I decided I would try blooming my tub of waves today. It definitely made things easier. I still felt like I had to work a bit to get the brush properly loaded but I'll probably keep doing this and see how it goes.\n\nWaves seem like a good fit today with the heat wave that were experiencing.

I actually wasn't thinking about what base it's in and was quickly reminded that it's the Reserve base. Gorgeously goopy goodness inbound! The soap and aftershave were as wonderful as is the norm for the bases. The scent is really something special though. I'm not normally a fan of a lot of sweeter, super citrusy bright scents, but this is nice. It's got a green undertone, but still such a bright green. I can't really describe it yet, but I'll say that I don't see the similarity between it and FG. My nose is still a rookie, so I'll sit down and give em a better sniff later today. See if I can get a hold of whatever it is that relates the two. But as of now, it's just a bright pop and happiness imo.\n\nThis is also my first time using the Fougere Platine decant I got last week, and it's nice. Woodsy, earthy with a nice pop of citrus itself, so definitely a good accompaniment I do believe. I lucked out and waited on both of these since I didn't shave last week or wear any frags and I'll be damned if they don't fit together. Happy accidents!",

Partly sunny, with a high near 82. Southwest wind around 10 mph, with gusts as high as 20 mph. Chance of precipitation is 30%. New precipitation amounts of less than a tenth of an inch, except higher amounts possible in thunderstorms. High tide at 10:36 tonight.\n\nCalled an audible this morning. I had planned on using Reserve Lavender for the soap this morning, but the tub that has my sample of Santa Maria Novella caught my eye. The fact that I can get a very nice shave after loading from a sample is very promising. Slickness and cushion are all there and in abundance even though it did leave my skin feeling a tad dry after i rinsed off. I would pick it up for performance on that fact alone. I don't think I will pick it up, mostly because I am trying to thin the collection, and the scent doesn't \"WOW\" me. Don't get me wrong, I'll use the sample up but I won't be picking up a full tub anytime soon.\n\nHave a nice Wednesday everyone!",

Stirling's Vanilla Sandalwood. It is tied with Barbarshop for my third favorite Stirling scent, also happens to be ny neice's favorite. It is a nice, sweet, comfort scent to me, like walking in the door and mom is making chocolate chip cookies. It is a light, happy scent and you cannot be in a bad mood after you smell it.\n\nRing of death reached the point where loading was a pain in the ass and my lathers were a little thin. Took what was left and smeared it into my lather bowl (after I knocked the dust out) so I'll probably be using this soap for a couple of days. Thankfully I have a decent selection of aftershaves I can use with it.\n\nEdit grammar",

The soap base was VERY good, but the scent just didn't want to come out and play. The Sabre also did well, but was slow to get busy for some reason, when compared to last time.\n\n#### ❧ Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Blackland - Sabre Level 2 ::: GEM - PTFE SE ‹3 uses›)*\n\nI remember the Sabre working better with this level 2 baseplate the last time I used it. But maybe my angles were off this time. Tiny bit of tugging sometimes. But man, this razor is fun to use and hold.\n\n#### ❧ Soap Notes\n*^(CBL Soaps - Barbershop)*\n\nThem: woody fougere with bright notes, spicy notes and powdery notes. This scent is heavily inspired by the old Rive Gauche Pour Homme (by Yves Saint Laurent) and to a lesser extent, Azzaro Pour Homme (by Azzaro)\n\nScent: For me, this was so light that it was really hard to pick out the scents. It was a little better than unscented, but just barely. I just pasted the write-up from the web site and was surprised by all that they were saying was there, when I smelled barely anything. I suppose it was a bad batch of soap.\n\nScent Strength: 2/10, barely present during shaving.\n\nLather: very very nice lather. Elastic, creamy and slick.\n\n* 20 sec load with a lightly-wet, dense, badger brush\n* 4 tsp water to build the lather\n* = 4 passes of lather.\n\nBowl - I used the XL version of this 3D-printable bowl:\nhttps://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3392930\n\n#### ❧ Brush Notes\n*^(Stirling - Finest in CravingShaving Blue Slate 26mm‹16 uses›)*\n\nNot pleasant to start with. The density and backbone were just a lot to deal with. But by the third pass, it was much nicer. I wonder if , like the Fanchurian from That Darn Rob, I may have to presoak this badger more than usual. We'll see!\n\n----\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Just a little tugging\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Few hairs are showing some tip length (with most being cut flush)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm) *and also in the sub's sidebar.*\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

He warned about trouble loading this soap and I can certainly see why, it is very very soft. So I bowl lathered with this one and made sure the soap was spread out in the bowl. That certainly helped.\nThe lather is really good, very slick. The aftershave is definitely heavy on the alcohol but the smell seems to have good staying power without being overwhelming. Will definitely keep this in the rotation.",

I've seen a few pucks of LfDL up on the bazaar lately so thought it was time to give my sample (thanks /u/fahrenheit915!) a go.\n\nBesides the scent being fantastic I continue to enjoy the SBSW base which gave me a great 3 pass shave today. The scent really was awesome throughout the whole shave, and post-shave my skin felt great. Hardly any irritation (the only bit was from me being aggressive on a couple spots) with the splash and the balm was just because I could.\n\nToday y'all need to take it easy on yourselves - it's the middle of the week, seasons are turning and a lot of workplaces are ramping up with year-end activities. Get yourself grounded and figure out the good stuff you're going to do this weekend.\n\nHappy hump day y'all!",

If I could go back in time several years I would have ordered this brush with a fan knot rather than a bulb, but it's still excellent, and it whipped up a great lather quickly with the very user-friendly Storybook base. I did a few more iterations of swirl strokes today and got a somewhat more voluminous lather than the last couple of days, though still dense and slick once well hydrated. The shave went well, and I had rather little sensation from the splash. My wife complimented the scent, I think it's growing on her. On today's smelling, I could pick out the leather, cedar and oak notes - don't know how I was missing the oak before.",

(See: date.)\n\nToday served as a textbook example of why I usually avoid using the same scent for my shave and perfume: the fruity top notes of Polo Blue are rather delicate. By the time I put on my perfume, I was so nose-blind to them (from the soap) that it's like I was just spraying water onto my wrist. Probably took a good 10 minutes before the heart compounds started to project and I could smell anything at all.\n\nIt just makes me go \"really?\" when I see dudes using a matching bath soap, shampoo bar, pre-shave oil, soap, splash, balm, and perfume (aka the \"it's my wedding day shave so I went all out on Executive Man\" shave). They must be leaving a sillage trail a mile long and they probably don't have a clue how strong it is because their nose is so burnt out within the first half hour.",

The razor was purchased from u/NorthSoundHamster about a year ago at my first PNW Wetshavers meetup. Also, it's pretty awesome to finally have a unicorn ivory broosh (even if it is B3). Whipped up a wonderful lather and did two passes on the dome leaving me nice and shiny for work today.",

      "body": "**Sep 11, 2019**\n\n* **Prep:** Warm shower & St. Ives Apricot Scrub\n* **Brush:** Maseto 26mm 2band \"Memphis\" knot (PIF'd by u/iamsms)\n* **Lather:** Italian Barber Amici\n* **Razor:** EJ DE89L\n* **Blade:** Voskhod (5)\n* **Post:** Nivea Creme\n\nWell, let me first say thank you to u/iamsms for the PIF of the brush. This now makes 2 brushes that I own, the other being the RazoRock Blondie boar brush. Since this was my first time using a badger brush, I didn't really know what to expect. I remember the first thing I thought when i saw the brush was 'wow, this is smaller than I thought', but that did not dissuade me. The loft is much smaller than I would have thought, and the backbone is super strong. This is a complete 180 from the Blondie, which is basically all loft and no backbone.\n\nI chose Amici for my first shave with the badger brush because I know it well and it never gives me any problems, plus the scent is to die for. I dipped the brush in warm water, let it drip a little, and went to work. In hindsight, I probably left too much water in the brush, but it all worked out. Since the Maseto brush has so much backbone, it hardly splays at all, which may be good for a bowl lather, I imagine, but I am a face latherer, so I had to work a little extra. I was honestly amazed at how much lather this little brush could hold. I think with everything I learned today, tomorrow should go even better.\n\nIn the end I got one of the best shaves I have gotten in a while. Whether that was due to the brush, the Voskhod blade, or just better technique, who can say. But I really like this brush and will continue using it. I love the handle which is longer, heavier, and skinnier than the Blondie, which is fat and hollow.\n\nThank you to everyone who does PIFs, you allow newbies like myself to try new products, and ask nothing in return.",

Some time ago I found a BST listing where a guy was basically selling all his extra soaps. He said he found his holy grail and was sticking with it. Out of curiosity I asked what he used, and he said Haslinger Schafmilch...but applied as a shave stick. Since I have a puck of Haslinger and have been experimenting with shave sticks myself recently, I decided to give it a try. I wet my face and the soap puck a little bit, and went to work.\n\nThe soap stuck to my face really well--even better than a regular shave stick, I'd say. Also, b/c of the larger surface area of the puck, I got the initial application done in less time. Another bonus: this Semogue badger had been sort of an odd man out in my rotation.....a bit less backbone than I like, a smaller knot...I just didn't reach for it as often. But it really shines as a face latherer w/ soap sticks. The animal hair holds heat well, and the density and splay w/ a small knot works up a lather in a hurry. My only mistake was not wringing it dry enough before lathering..I thought I got most of the water out but there was still enough in there that the lather was runnier than I wanted. That's easy enough to correct next time. Either way, I was happy w/ the performance of the soap and it's nice to know I have yet another travel shave \"stick\" option in my den.",

Ironically we hit upper 80s today but having been waiting to try Haverford I had to break into it. Great lather and slickness is to be expected from Stirling but the scent to me is wonderful. Deep and dark with a hit of fruit this stuff is great. I went with my usual sample puck but this one may get a full sized pickup. In my everlasting quest of cheapness I paired my shave with the Tobacco Vanille oil clone that I found on Amazon. Stuff is nice but with a stronger clove note than the soap. Getting some tobacco leaf and just a hint of vanilla but good stuff none the less.\n\nAs a side note I have started shaving my head in the past week. I was getting tired of my thinning/receding top so off it went. I had previously been shaving the top to a 3 and sides at 2 but took the plunge the other day. As I said previously my face shave is dialed in, head not so much. First time was a burned disaster but no nicks/cuts so thats a win. As of now im shaving it every day and a half or so (at night then the second days morning and vice versa), and alternating each time between a DE and flex4 (using Stirling soap with both methods). Cart is definately faster and more forgiving while the DE gives a smoother shave but im still getting some burn hence the alternating. In due time im sure I'll get the hang of it but as of now I need them training wheels haha.",

This is my second time using Terror and it's a unique feel while shaving. I made sure to carefully wash my hands after as the cooling agent tends to transfer quite easily. Best part though is the performance of the Excelsior base.\n\nThe Karve/Voshkod combo was so much better than my last shave with the Rockwell/Voshkod. Makes me wonder - what razor/blade combos did not work for you?\n\nOverall a fantastic shave - much needed before I head to the airport for a long journey across the Atlantic. My body and mind are ready for the break.\n\nHave a great hump day. Ciao!",

It's refreshing to me, and I foresee myself thoroughly enjoying this scent all year round.\n\nThe consistency of the soap is firm, maybe (for sake of recognizability) between B&M Excelsior and Glissant. It loads and lathers extremely quickly, and has a medium thirst. It is plenty slick, and post shave is great! I'm going to reserve opinion until I have more experience with it in, but it's looking very good!\n\nDFS with a new to me soap maker and scent!

I've been reading great things about slants and how even though the customer service might suck, razorock has quality products. So I got the German in hopes it might be more efficient than my rockwell on 6. Maybe it's just my inexperience with a slant, but I wasn't all that impressed. Otherwise the feel was pretty good.\n\nOn the other hand, Noble Otter was wonderful! I really had to hunt down a place to buy the set together so I didn't have to pay shipping twice (and because I'm too impatient to wait for more restocks) and I'm so happy with the scent and performance it was great.\n\nOh and I decided not to bloom with my SOC today and it actually worked out pretty well.

WTG, XTG, and another XTG clean up. Soap worked amazingly. Glue-like lather that is very stretchy and creamy. One of the best soaps that I have used. Brush felt amazing as well. The SHD knot gave for a firm but soft lather. The gel tips brushing against the face felt nice. The razor + blade was mild and efficient, just how I like it. Mild post shave to wrap it up.\n\nThe OUMO brush finally came in the mail and boy, does it feel nice. Because of the SHD feature, it has a firm feel on the face but still soft with all the gel tips. It looks nice and definitely looks better when wet. I'm glad to have the chance to try this brush and will be keeping it for the long term. I'll be keeping a similar shave for the rest of this week and changing it up next week with some SE!",

I replied with \"I plead the fifth.\" She will never know now!\n\nRazor seems to be a similar head design compared to the Bronze, just with a bigger blade gap. Shaved my head, just to see how right /u/angry_cardboard_box was. And he's right, makes a great little head shaver. Nicked my dome once or twice, but that is going to go down in a \"user is tired\" category. Performed well. The weight it fantastic for head shaving, with the whole razor coming in at 47.6 grams (1.67oz). It's my belief that this is an offering for people who like the Bronze 0.38mm, but wanted a bigger blade gap.\n\nThis is also the tub that I would have used if it was for that meddling /u/phteven_j!\n\nHave a nice Thursday everyone!",

The Saponificio Bignoli Sandalo Indiano has a very distinct citrusy scent on top of a very subtle sandalwood, and while not as bad as the Castle Forbes and TOBS, the citrus does overpower the sandalwood. The soap itself is more of a croap, so I scooped some out into a bowl, instead of applying directly to face like other creams. Soap performance was very nice, but pretty drying with the post-shave feel.",

Inspired by u/Old_Hiker's recent SOTD comments, I decided to go unscented today, out of courtesy to the doctor. Turns out I don't have any unscented shave soap, but I do have an old tube of Cremo. That stuff is very lightly scented, and what scent there is does not last, so it seemed like it might be my best bet.\n\nCremo actually worked well for me. The trick is to accept that it is not a soap, it does not lather. Smear a small amount evenly on face, put a few drops of water in your hand and work the water into the Cremo on your face. Then keep doing that a bunch of times. You are building an oil-water emulsion, as slick as possible. Keep that one hand covered in slippery stuff all shave long, don't wipe it off. Re-wet the hand (a few drops) and re-smear the face as needed throughout the shave. Think slippery thoughts. Forget cushion, go all in for slickness. Forget three passes, just keep feeling around as you rewet the slickeriness, interleave buffing and re-wetting. Wherever you feel stubble, kill it. Seek and destroy. It's a very tactile process.\n\nThe brush-soap ritual we know and love is a nice meal, carefully prepared, eaten at the dinner table. Shaving with Cremo is heating up a microwave burrito and eating it standing up, right out of the wrapper. Different things, both have their place. Convenience and expedience have their days.\n\nBy sheer serendipity, a most austere shave.",

I suppose I would have picked something to try and kill, so my continuation of Sample September is on theme enough.\n\n\n\nHaven't used the Reserve Base in a little while and it was a pleasure to bring it out today. The lather was shiny and I got that perfect Reserve consistency of cheap yogurt. (I mean that in a good way). When it's not quite runny but a dollop of lather can go flying at any minute in any direction, I know I've got it dialed in. Residual slickness was on point and the post shave felt great. An all round excellent shave.\n\n\n\nI was going to wear CL Omnostre again today but Tres Matres felt like a good pairing that I decided to use at the last minute. I'm really digging the earthy notes right now and TM has enough crossover to carry the Fern along. Excellent performance on the splash and the EdP is a perfect match. I'm glad I chose this one today.

Luckily I had already decided on the Wholly Kaw MoT and in a seredipidous case of chance thats what I would have used for AA. Reasoning? AA was never going to be scented for me. My fear was that using a scented set for a month straight would ruin it for me. For me the soap decision was which of the four unscenteds I have was I going to use. The WK MoT was going to be my AS choice because of all the aftershaves I own it was the one I was most 'Meh' about and I wanted to use it up. The reason I was ambivalent about it was because to me it was a weak scent that was initially overpowered by that hit of menthol I always get first with mentholated AS and I bearly smelled the tobacco. Between the last time I used MoT and today I have learned that I was not using enought aftershave (I used to bearly wet my hands) and today I think was the first time I acctually got to smell the AS and I've upped my opinion of it. Looks like I got an addditionl bonus out of completing u/rocketk455 's unscented challange.\n\nThird time with the SilkSmoke brush and I learned a little bit more about it, specifically why it works better when I start with making my lather in a bowl. As I did not have my bowl available today 'cause it has my remaining VS smeard in the bottom I lathered completely on my face. I noticed that until the lather reaches a certain hydration level it is extremely difficult to get any splay. It is like using a paintbrush that is full of half dried paint. Once you cross that level though, while still stiff it becomes much easier to use. Might have to overcome my extreme distaste for lather overflowing the container onto my hands and try the Marco Method with this brush.\n\nEdit grammar",

Very cologne like, hard to pick out individual notes, but mixed very well. Decided to try out Aoud Lemon Mint today from the Discovery set. This is a very fresh take on the Aoud line. The Lemon is very invigorating and sticks with the scent into the dry down. Patchouli and Leather come out after the initial spray. A great scent so far, be interesting to see where the dry down goes.",

As such, I continued to be rewarded with an excellent, rich lather. Just nice, dense and slick stuff that holds lots of lather. My sniffer was a bit clogged so I didn't smell much during the shave, though I'm starting to pick up some notes of the splash now that I'm at work.\n\nAlso, a quick note for /u/Zaboomifu - I took the second puck of Williams home and shaved the ridges off each side. I'll try showering with it tonight. I stuffed the scraps, which totaled 8g, into the mug with the remnants of my first puck, which incidentally had lost 6g of water since the end of August (weight from 17g to 11g). I will probably try to kill that off once I've finished my week of Hook.\n\nFinally, in what is probably one of the dumber things I've done in a while I got inspired by one of /u/ScotchyClaus 's videos and some ad copy on his site and ordered several pucks of George F. Trumper Violet shaving soap from an Amazon vendor who inexplicably had the puck in bowl listed for $10.02 (they had the pucks alone for $14 or so). And this, after I was complaining the other day that I had too much soap! The reason for the inspiration was that the method described for lathering the stuff was nearly identical to the method I ended up using on Williams in August. I must be a glutton for punishment, or perhaps I was simply enticed by paying less for soap in a wood bowl than I would normally pay for the bowl alone.",

Though I would hate to use any one soap for a month, this would be a good choice for that endeavor of self-inflicted privation.\n\n**Razor / Blade**: The usual tempting AC shave - 12 hour BBS with two passes, a quicker than usual shave due to the added blade width, and a smooth comfy feel. The SoftGuard looks very weird - strange wavy edge guard -\n\n[https://sharprazorpalace.com/shaving-shavette-razors/134324-feather-aritst-club-blade-info.html](https://sharprazorpalace.com/shaving-shavette-razors/134324-feather-aritst-club-blade-info.html)\n\nbut shaves smoothly. About the same as a ProGuard, slightly smoother first shave than a Proline. The ProGuard has a sort of net around the blade, while Soft uses a wavy ridge.\n\nThey both seem designed to minimize the harshness of the Feather Pro, a blade that some complain is \"too sharp\". I find the Pro gives a somewhat harsh first shave, but then is fine, so the net / wave pattern only really adds to value on Shave 1 of 10 to 12.\n\nThe SoftGuard costs more than other AC blades, and at least after shave one, does not feel that much better than a ProGuard, Proline, or even the value leading Feather Pro. We'll see how the Softie holds up over double digits of shaves.\n\n**Frag:** Woods, vanilla, and amber base with spicy top and floral mid notes. Lasts forever, textbook projection, and an industry best atomizer mechanism. Is this scent Chanel's best regular line masculine? Compared to the discombobulated American Pour Monsieur, certainly; have not tried the fabled international version of CPM.",

I originally called out u/Phteven_j's in my submission since contest his had the most participation but in hindsight it could apply to all of the AA contests since it changed what everyone was planning to use or at least swayed their decision if they were on the fence.\n\nPrior to the announcement of the various AA contests I was planning to use Leviathan. The ring on the bottom of the tub keeps growing larger with each shave and I have no doubt that I could have killed my first tub during AA. I haven't weighed it yet but would estimate about 20 shaves left.\n\nLeviathan is one of my favorite scents. After doing an entire month of VoA where I began to go nose blind to the scent the longer I used it, I don't think I would have enjoyed using Leviathan after the first week. I still want to kill this tub and might do a full week of Leviathan once the weather cools down or will rotate it in more often.",

I think it's going to be my go-to set until it's gone. I've always thought of it as more of a warm weather scent, but it does fine in the cold, too.\n\nYesterday, I tried Barrister and Mann's Terror aftershave, thanks to a PIF from u/Chainsaw_Boner (Thanks again!). It was really nice, but boy was it cold and long lasting. The extreme cold only lasted for a half hour or so, but I would get hints of cold throughout the day. Then, this morning, when I put on my YRP aftershave, the cold came back for about 5 minutes! The scent on it is really nice, it reminded me of mint toothpaste, but done in a really classy manner. With how cold the aftershave is, it's probably not going to see major usage until it warms up here again, but I'm super glad I have it (it's my only mentholated (synthetic) aftershave).",

When /u/rocketk455 proposed a scent-free month, I figured why not? It's not much of a jump from lightly scented soap and a splash that I was already almost nose-blind to (from over-use in July) to *actually unscented products.*\n\nAs for the perfume, there was never any single perfume that I would have been willing to wear all month. The idea of going blind to *any perfume in my collection* is horrifying to me because I love (or at least like) all of them. It's rare enough that I wear the same fragrance two days in a row, never mind every day for a month.\n\nToday I'm somewhat arbitrarily choosing Legend, simply so that I can be wearing Mitchell's, Mennen, and Montblanc. Mmm. Smells good.",

I always use a fresh Astra SP when I try out a new razor because they are my go to blade. I found it to be mild and comfortable while still being efficient enough to get the job done in my usual 2 pass plus touch up shave. It has a nice weight to it and while I don't usually care for satin/bead blasted finishes on razors, it seems to fit well with this one. I didn't notice any dragging feeling during the shave which can sometimes happen with unpolished razors. Although that could be attributed to the super slick MW lather ;). My first thoughts on the handle when I saw pictures were that It was ugly and I didn't like it, but once I had it in hand, I couldn't be more wrong. It's a great handle as far as function goes. I could get used to the looks too. All in all, I like the razor quite a bit and I'm excited to get some more shaves in with it.",

A couple of new things: GEM G-Bar and the Slatteroy soap. Also seeing if a long soak on the badger makes a difference.\n\n#### ❧ Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(GEM - G-Bar ::: GEM - PTFE SE ‹4 uses›)*\n\nThis is a family heirloom and I'm proud to have it. My uncle went through some of my great uncle's stuff and found this little ... ahem... gem. I'm glad it's not as aggressive as my Micromatic. The blade is not held too securely, as I could hear the chatter. But it was just felt as blade feel and not as roughness and I walked away without any irritation. It did take 4 passes to get a good shave, though. This could be just because I haven't learned the right angle, though.\n\nI sure was glad to try it out, and I could use it for daily shaves if I wanted. Easy to hold and nice balance.\n\n#### ❧ Soap Notes\n*^(Fitjar Islands - Slåtterøy)*\n\nThem: Exotic woody spices with bright notes of spicy citrus\n\nScent: I got the full hit of the lemon. But during the shave I got none of the exotic woody spices. I did pick up a little of the latter if I buried my nose in the bowl.\n\nIf you don't like strong lemon soaps, I'd avoid this guy, though I really enjoyed the lather.\n\nScent Strength: 5/10, nicely present during shaving.\n\nLather: I liked the lather. Creamy and voluminous while being slick too. Felt good on the face.\n\nSecondary slickness is low on this one, though. But as long as you relather before hitting an area again, you should be fine. And even after using an alcohol-based post shave, I still didn't experience any dryness after all the action.\n\n* long soak on the puck, since it IS a hard soap\n* 30 second load with lightly-wet dense badger brush\n* unknown amt of water to build the lather\n* = 7 passes of lather.\n\nBowl - I used the XL version of this 3D-printable bowl:\nhttps://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3392930\n\n#### ❧ Brush Notes\n*^(Stirling - Finest in CravingShaving Blue Slate 26mm‹17 uses›)*\n\nThis guy definitely did better with a longer soak before the shave. I helped the tips be softer during the first pass, and the knot open up a bit more. I'll be doing this from now on.\n\nStill a bit of drag while in scrubbing mode on the first pass. Maybe due to all the stubble and so many hairs on the brush. I'm going to remember to feel for that as I use other brushes.\n\n----\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Very Close Shave\n*Neck*: Many hairs show whisker tips with a little length to them\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm) *and also in the sub's sidebar.*\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

The synthetic is a nice fit for it--no matter how much lather I need, there always seems to be a bit more left in the brush. This was the most efficient and slick feeling I've had on a 1st pass, outside of high end artisan soaps or using a slant razor. Really impressed at the quality for the price (even buying off ebay looks like it's < $2/stick shipped to U.S.). If I had discovered this soap earlier I might not have gone so hog-wild accumulating all the other soaps I did.",

No nicks, no irritation, and a lot faster for a DFS than either of my previous shaves. Even the alum went on without stinging.\n\nAs for soap, I gotta say, Arko is great! I face lathered it with just what came off the stick on a quick run around my face and it exploded with lather.\nI did 2 pases and some spot touching, but I could have went for 4 with all the lather I still had. I love the scent too. Idk where the urinal puck comments are coming from, but I didn't get that at all. I thought it was fresh, clean, traditional soap scent.\n\nOn to the blade. I'm glad I let this Voskhod blade rock for another shave. The 2nd was iffy, but this 3rd use has been the best yet, and probably my smoothest ever and that's including all my years on the shavette. I just hope I don't have to go through 2 ok shaves to get top tier everytime.\n\nMy no name brush is improving? Yeah. I don't know what the fibers are, but it was noticeably softer today and splayed really easily. It may be for lack of experience with better brushes, but if it stays at this level, or gets even better, I don't see any reason to get another.\n\nFinally got another bottle of Lagerfeld Classic, the fragrance that started me on my journey here. Now that I've been away from it, I like it even more. I'll definitely always keep it around. Just waiting for Fougere Gothique to drop in EdP again before I use the shave set more. I only skipped it todaybecause I didn't want it to clash with the Lagerfeld.\n\nSorry for the typos, I may fix them later. I'm mostly voice typing while I getting ready to go. Already gonna be late, but wanted to share this most excellent shave.",

Before that, we thought that most of the folks inside would be able to make their way down. But really, where I was, we didn't do much thinking. We were just in shock. I'm sorry for the families of the 3,120 who died that day. And I'm sorry for the hate that caused it.\n\nBut like one of the victim's parents said, after she mourned for her son, she said instead of getting bitter and dwelling on the loss of time with her boy, that she would instead always remember and cherish the time that she *did* have, and the blessing that he was for as long as he was here. So gracious.\n\nAnd I loved how the nation came together in unity, and there was giving, and helping, and healing.\n\nI still remember.\n\n----\n\nI chose a soap that felt suitable, and I do love this scent. Also returned to one of my favorite brushes. And I show off my new polish job on my Chris Bradley.\n\n#### ❧ Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Karve - Christopher Bradley ::: Gillette - Platinum ‹13 uses›)*\n\nOh I love this head. No irritation and great, close cut. Nice feel while shaving, too.\n\n#### ❧ Soap Notes\n*^(Stirling - Responders 4 Life - Gray Vetiver)*\n\nScent: classy and understated. Strong in character, but mild in presence. Interesting and yet classic and professional. Doesn't put on airs. I can see how this was chosen to represent first responders as they do their jobs with the same admirable character traits.\n\nPatterned after Tom Ford's Gray Vetiver.\n\nScent strength was 5/10, nicely available during the shave.\n\nLather: Tremendous lather today. Excellent performance, protection, and glide.\n\n* 30 second load with a lightly-wet, soft slivertip badger brush\n* 2.5 tsp water to build the lather\n* = 7 passes of lather\n\nBowl - I used the XL version of this bowl:\nhttps://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3392930\n\n#### ❧ Brush Notes\n*^(Whipped Dog - Silvertip 22mm Tall Handle‹9 uses›)*\n\nWell, I think this knot has a little more backbone than the Golden Nib Premium Silvertip I also like. And it puts it squarely ahead of the Nib. This is the way I like brushes to feel. NOt nearlyu as much drag as the STirling finest, as I suspected. Too many firm bristles I guess.\n\n----\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Cut flush to where I just see the tips (above average for me)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm) *and also in the sub's sidebar.*\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

I even tried to supplement it with some unscented soap but to my dismay it was all dried out, proving difficult to work with. I shaved, but it wasn't very enjoyable. That's not going to change anytime soon, it took about 3 minutes but I scooped that dried, unscented soap sample into my bowl and will be using that for the next few days.\n\nLife is short, shave with good gear.",

It's been a long time since I have used SBSW and the base is better than I remember (I'm probably better at making a good lather than I was before to be fair). Loads easily, whips into a nice creamy lather easily and decent post shave.\n\nThis is a scent I have wanted to try for a while. Scent notes are listed as: Lavender, Sandalwood, Vanilla, Peppermint, Cedar, and Amyris. When I first smelled it, it smelled like a good cup of peppermint tea. I wasn't able to pick out the other scent. As the shave progressed, I did catch tiny whiffs of vanilla and a fleeting hint of sandalwood, but not much other than the peppermint. The peppermint is not overpowering, but my nose can't pick up the other scents yet.\n\nOverall a good 2 pass shave. Hope you all have a good day and a good weekend.\n\nHappy Friday!",

Apparently it was made for the south florida wet shavers meet up, but WCS has it in stock on their site. I definitely recommend you all check it out if you like the duck fat soap base and a nice citrus and green scent!",

I think I need more practice with it. I really struggle to find the best cutting angle with this thing, it seems very mild and not the most efficient, which is weird, because I was expecting it to be more aggressive and efficient. Huh. I also seem to sort of struggle to really dial in a lather with Turtleship and I usually end up with a airy and foamy lather, instead of a shiny, thick lather. Shave went ok, it's just not my top tier experience stuff. Side note : Why don't more people use spray bottles for their aftershaves? Holy hell, the sample of Cat O' Nine Tails from Maggard in their little spray bottle thing was a game changer. Did I get a bit in my eyes? Sure. Did I breath some in? Maybe. Second side note : This stuff really felt strange for the first 15 seconds or so. It's like a chemical burning reaction, but in a pleasant way? My face was RED, but only for a minute or two, then it all calmed down and felt nice and smooth. Weird stuff. Smells like Fireball Whiskey.\n\n**\"You're all doomed!\"**",

I also thought this was the perfect shave to break out my shiny new Custom Dogwood with a Declaration B8. It's meant to be a sort of deconstructed barber pole and I think u/phteven_j nailed it. The brush got to Scott right when he was moving so it took a little while to get knotted but it was with the wait. First shave was great and I'm looking forward to the rest of the break in process.\n\n\n\nDesairology is just so good. The scent notes read like I had made a list of all my favorite things. Sandalwood, musk, oakmoss, citrus, lavender, vanilla, oud, burnt white sage, burnt palo santo, gardenia. How could that be anything short of fantastic? Amazing shave today.",

I'll take the compliment.\n\nIn news that perhaps only /u/Zaboomifu is interested in, I can now say from experience that Williams makes a good shower soap. The scent is not particularly great - just way too heavy on the citronella - but for shower purposes it lathers fine either by hand or with the (and I use the technical term here) poofy shower scrubby thing, it takes grime off decently, and leaves the skin feeling clean and just a tiny bit tight.",

I know other people say it smells dark and smoky and all that, but I seriously get more of a freshly turned garden soil scent. I say this every time, but it honestly brings me back to summers working in the garden with my dad as a child. It's a wonderful scent and I love it ever so dearly! It was my first foray into the Reserve base and I truly was hooked the day I got it in the mail. Hell, it was the first backup set I ever got as well! Speaking of backups, did we ever find out if this is a temporary offering again or are both of the Fougeres permanent?\n\nAnyway, lovely shave, lovely scent, lovely everything.

Super creamy lather that developed easily and provided plenty of slickness both throughout my two passes and some light buffing. As far as the post shave, it was right up there with any base I've tried, after I rinsed that lather from my face it felt as if I had already applied an AS. Then once the Maol grooming splash was applied it just took the shave over the top, probably my favorite splash base and leaves my face feeling as if I applied a toner.\n\nThe scent on this set is a home run for me, super clean nature scent without feeling too green or floral. Perfect for an office environment or wearing out, kind of an all weather scent for me. Super happy I picked up this set!\n\nHave a great Friday everyone",

Time to use my badger for a couple of days.\n\nWSP's Black Amber Vanille is definitely my favorite scent of theirs, though to be honest I've only tried 3 of them. The only way I can describe it, as I still have an uncultured nose, is a 'dark vanilla'. If VS is a sunny spring day, BAV is a foggy fall night.\n\nWSP's Tobacco Vanilla, according to Lee, shares nothing but the name with Tom Ford's Tobacco vanilla. Comparing it with the only example of TFTV that I have, Sritlings Haverford, he is correct. The scents are sorta kinda nothing alike. WSP's is more tobacco and less sweet. I definitely smell the cedar standing right behind it. Given how little I wear frags I wish he sold this is 30 ml decants,100 ml is two lifetimes for me.\n\nOff to make sure the storms last night didn't harm the seedlings (cukes and tomatos) that I put in yesterday, and putz around the yard. Have a great weekend everyone.\n\nEdit grammar as usual",

I've been shaving, just not been posting. Today marks a blade trial in my effort to find a replacement for my Rapiras...broke 2 rules in that I don't usually like Personas and I tend to avoid Platinum coated blades, but considering Gillette Blacks worked alright and had a similar coating, I figured this would be worth a try. Some irritation, but I think that's just me not being used to the nuances of the blade and not a single cut. Let's see how these do tomorrow.",

The soap was very easy to get dialed in and offered a comfortable shave. The aftershave is very good as well. It sits right in my sweet spot for my skin, which means that it doesn't dry out your face but also leaves no sticky or oily feeing.\n\nScent is very lavender forward, although the other parts come out more in the soap than the aftershave. The aftershave dries down with a slightly darker lavender and almost a little powdery not to it as well.\n\nI'm really impressed with this set overall.",

To anyone feeling their DE usage career is a rollercoaster of variable results, try AC. The freshly paved Texas interstate highway of wet shaving...\n\nThat said, the SoftGuard still seems pretty unexecptional. Shave is decent but not markedly different from ProGuard or even Proline.\n\n**Brush:** Simpson, of all my brushes, never needs any mix adjustment between soap and water - always loads with the perfect ratio. Simpson, perhaps predictably after decades of doing this stuff, gives one a dense knot that nevertheless has highly efficient flow through. The break in took a while, but this brush (along with my Duke 3) is now a joy to use, and the closest thing one can find to a badger with autopilot.\n\n**Lather:** A very mainstream scent - aquatic / clean linen with hints of vetiver and cedar. The mix is not at all irritating to my face (other aquatics like MLS Kraken and B&M Latha Oceana were like napalm for me) and the scent is soothing without being dull. I like Shire a bit more, but this scent is a fine change of pace.\n\n**Frag:** Atomizer jammed the other day, but was working fine today. A lovely Fall scent, and a natural perfumery triumph for the Brand That Can Do No Wrong.",

But as a proud member of SMAS, I ain't sweatin' it (or maybe I am?). Another very nice shave with the Silversmith. I'm seriously considering picking one up if or when they come back in stock.

It's comfortably masculine but sweet and it's extremely old school in the way that pipe tobacco and a smoking jacket make you think of your grandpa. I decided I needed to have at least one of these in my den, but realized that there were so many choices that there must be some kind of variation between them, especially after so many years of dancing around this same scent profile. Anyway, on to today's shave!\n\nToday I paired Barnegat Bay, a product I had previously rated only just below top contender so far Chiseled Face Bay Rum, with featured product Barrister and Mann Bay Rum because after smelling the BaM Bay Rum in the jar I thought it would more wholly complement the scent profile. Also, I only have 2 bay rum aftershaves and I have to make it look like this operation is more professional than it is...\n\nBefore I get to the scent, I'd like to make a note about performance. I'm not sure if Bay Rum comes in the new excelsior base or not, but my sample was in glissant, and I have to say it's my favorite of the 3 BaM bases I have tried. Reserve got very marshmallow-y and sticky and took about ten minutes to save every time I used it, Excelsior is just too damn thirsty (ain't nobody got time to sit still for 8 minutes while vigorously moving their right hand in anything but an up and down motion) but glissant was a perfect mixture between elite performance and ease of use. I didn't get the sticky strings even starting with a very dry brush, and didn't have to add much water at all to finish with an excellent lather. Now that I've committed blasphemy...\n\nBaM opens in the jar with a bay-forward but complex spice blend. I get clove, cardamom, allspice, anise, a hint of peppery coriander (this is my nose playing tricks on me) and of course bay. This spicey scent is extremely well mixed and very pleasant, and honestly this is my favorite scent in its \"inert\" state out of everything I've thus far reviewed. This is the most traditionally \"autumn\" bay rum so far as well, which, given it is September, I suppose is appropriate. Under lather this soap opens up into citrus accord and the clove strengthens to create a wonderfully citrus-y spiced rum scent. The nose is not very sweet; rather it smells like a dry wind offshore breeze on a refreshing day. I'm left with just a hint of the initial un-lathered spice blend on the face after clean up. BaM really knocked it out of the park with this one, and I'm going to give it the crown with 4.4 Cuba Libres! There are plenty more of these to come, though, so stay tuned.\n\nCaitie's Bubbles, originally given 4/5 Cuba Libres, really comes into it's own paired with the dry spicy scent on the BaM soap. I feel like I need to mention the performance on this one again--this is some of the most exquisitely formulated alcohol based splash I've ever used. If you haven't given this company a go I would strongly recommend you do.\n\nNext week I'm digging into Dr Jon's Anne Bonny and I hope to have some Long Rifle Bay Rhum aftershave for some variety and to give the illusion that I'm far more prepared than I am!",

Tornadic\n\n**Razor:** Gillette Fat Handle Tech (Post-War)\n\n**Blade:** Gillette 7 O'clock Sharp Green (6)\n\n**Splash:** Oz Shaving Co. Tornadic\n\n**Post:** Nada\n\nALRIGHT IT'S FRIDAY Y'ALL. Yesterday was a bit of a Charlie Foxtrot but it's all good. Happy to do the work just takes more out of me when it's like it was yesterday. Comes with the job and the job is overall pretty daggum good.\n\nSo I'm starting in on all the ridiculous goodies /u/MadDingersYo sent my way as part of his Mad PIFs Yo Round 2. As if the generosity wasn't already enough to cram in to the back of truck he piled on even more that was in the PIF including two *extra* full pucks. Freaking solid. I spent most of my free time going back and forth smelling everything at least twice so I'd be prepared for what I assumed was going to be decision paralysis.\n\nLuckily it was easy. For those who haven't read the Dark Tower there are tie-ins to other literary works within it. One of those is to the Wizard of Oz, so Tornadic was an eaaaaaasy choice say true.\n\nFirst go with an Oz Shave Co soap and I really dug it. I made a hell of a mess with the lather but that's a good thing. It was VOLUMINOUS which was a real plus for me. Easy as heck to dial in and loved the smell. I nice clean Fougere. I'm stuffed up today so I wasn't getting all the notes but the rain was really coming through nicely. VERY happy with things here. Thank you SO SO much again MDY.\n\n6th shave on the Gillette Green and I can tell some difference. It's still totally viable to get a good shave but it's lost that \"oooOOOoooh\" factor. Got a bunch of stuff going on this weekend which means I have good reasons for weekend shaves and think I'll grab a fresh blade for tomorrow.\n\nGet out there and get some of the Friday goodness folks.",

It hits all the metrics that are important to me, which are ease of lather, slick, and the price is more than fair. Post Shave is also pretty good, probably. I really wouldn't know because I always use, you know, a post shave product. Scents are unique other than the basics which are good too for a change. The fact that /u/phteven_j devotes so much of his time to this community made it easy to want to funnel them some money early on, but we're past that now. It's good stuff.<end stroking. kind of>\n\nBetween Samhain and Pomona, Southern Witchcrafts is the kind of fall soaps for me. But they've got another that I didn't get on well with, Autumn Ash. I had a sample a year or so ago, and remember it being cloyingly sticky sweet, similar to my take on Chatillon Lux's Bon Vivant. I don't remember if I ever even lathered it up, was too sweet off the sample and I wrote it off. I'd been thinking about giving it another shot recently, and then when /u/Not_a_robot_101 gave it a plug on the fall scents thread that sealed the deal for me....And why just grab another sample when I can pickup a full tub and the EdP? Yeah.....Upon receiving and opening the tub, it was exactly as I remember. so, so sweet. I immediately felt regret. Then I sprayed the EDP - the reason I picked up the EdP is to my nose, a bunch of the Southern Witchcrafts soaps and EdP's smell very different. Hey - the EdP is excellent. Is it sweet, yes. but as it dries down I got some of the other listed notes that begin to tame the sweetness. OK, I can try using this....\n\nOn lathering the soap, some of the sweetness does die down and the earthy notes are present as they are in the EdP. It's still a sweet bomb though bordering on gourmand. The EdP is where the scent shines for sure for me as it's not as sticky sweet.\n\nOverall, I don't think this is a use a few times a week soap for me, especially once Samhain arrives, but i'll likely keep it and pull it out from time to time....or it may end up on the bazaar \"used 3-5x\", we'll see. No regrets, for now. /u/120inna55 wrote a [great review](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/9rxsyw/southern_witchcrafts_autumn_ash/) about a year ago and I agree with most of his sentiments.",

Jotun is an excellent wood and citrus scent. The notes are Pine, Cedar, Tangerine, and Menthol. This was a cold soap, but it wasn't overly freezing. Honestly, it was right where I like it. The tangerine note is complementary to the pine and cedar, without dominating. I find that happens frequently with citrus notes, and I'm more of a woodsy guy anyway, so I was very happy with the scent.\n\nAs far as the performance goes, I was impressed. The base was easy to lather and provided a rich lather. This was my first use of the soap, so consider this more of my first impressions than a true informed opinion. Maybe I'll improve my lather as I dial it in.\n\nI found the slickness and protection to be in the same vein of excellent but not the very best soaps. In my mind, Declaration, BaM's Excelsior, Wholly Kaw, and Talbot (maybe APR? There are probably another base or two one could argue fit here) are on another level at the very absolute top, and then there is a tier of bases like Noble Otter, Southern Witchcrafts, Mammoth, Caties Bubbles, and the like. These bases are not perfect, but they have their own merits and will leave me very pleased with my shave. Then there are bases that are certainly usable but I don't find great (I probably have to put a little more care in, use a pre-shave butter, etc.), which I consider Chiseled Face, Mickey Lee, and several older bases. There may be scents good and unique enough for me to bust them out from time to time (looking at you, Drunken Goat), but they aren't my go-to.\n\nI would place Lotus Eater in that second tier, which puts them among fantastic company. I've got three more of their samples, so I'll give them each a try. I'm very much looking forward to it.",

It isn't a perfect match, but it will work, and more herbaceous than B&M's 42 offering. These are the only Lemon soaps I own, so it was between these two. It isn't the best, but it's far from the worst, so I'm good with it! Until I get the soap that is =P\n\nDFS for me today, and a new aftershave scent to take in.

I don't think it's very good compared to the other available options. I found the post shave feel to be lacking, my skin was quite dried out after the shave. I really love the scent though and I'm not aware of many lilac-scented soaps by other artisans. I will enjoy using the rest of the sample but I probably won't buy a full puck.",

Even just the soap has a very respectable amount of cooling both during and after the shave. Lovely.\n\nThe SC is less aggressive and exciting than my RFB, but it's a beautifully smooth shaver. Combined with Terror and GLS, this was a wonderful shave to start the weekend.\n\nBetween FdB, Santal Majascule and Boutique, sweet sandalwood frags are absolutely my jam right now.\n\nHave an awesome weekend you guys!",

Life has been busy. Still shaving, not buying as much stuff (which I'm totally okay with). I'm at a good point in the hobby where I have great software and hardware, am happy with everything I have, and really only buys a brush every now and again if scott makes something I absolutely adore.\n\nSpeaking of, this was my first shave with my first jeffo. Having broken in one B8 I know it will get much softer, but I am still amazed in how dense these brushes are. Excited to get to know this one more. Texaus hit the spot, such an amazing scent. I think I will be picking up jungle warrior.\n\nHappy days all!",

Tried a Grizzly Bay brush for the first time, as well as revisiting my Sabre and an old friend, a good Sandalwood from L&W.\n\nToday I chose this soap because of a special request from my friend George, and I was reminded of how nice and slick the lather is. And i love the authentic sandalwood scent.\n\n#### ❧ Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Blackland - Sabre ::: GEM - PTFE SE ‹5 uses›)*\n\nVery good shave. Much more comfortable than a few days ago with the Sabre. Maybe the blade has smoothed out, with a few uses now. It holds the blade so firmly that it's a great feeling to shave. You do feel the blade, but it feels good.\n\nNo tugging or irritation.\n\n#### ❧ Soap Notes\n*^(Lather & Wood - Sandalwood)*\n\nScent: A straight sandalwood scent, and a good and true one in my opinion. I like it.\n\nScent Strength: 5/10, nicely present during shaving.\n\nThis is one of the first soaps I ever bought years ago. Got great reviews on Amazon at the time and though I haven't used it all that much over the years, it has held up really well. Scent strength hasn't missed a beat.\n\nLather: a really nice and slick lather, that protected well.\n\n* 30 second load with lightly-wet badger brush\n* 4 tsp water to build the lather\n* = 6 passes of lather.\n\nBowl - I used the XL version of this 3D-printable bowl:\nhttps://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3392930\n\n#### ❧ Brush Notes\n*^(TGN - Finest Grizzly Bay Red White Blue 24mm‹1 uses›)*\n\nWell, I have not been quick to try out this brush handle shape, which is quite distinctive. And that turned out to be a good idea. It is a bit uncomfortable on my fingertips, though the pads of my fingers have good grip on the wide bottom part. Maybe it is designed for someone with smaller digits.\n\nBut I did like the knot quite a bit. It was soft while still scrubbing well. I did feel something like a root ball that may have been the scrubby part. It splayed nicely and if this was the only brush I ever had, I think I'd be fine with it.\n\n----\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Few hairs are showing some tip length (with most being cut flush)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm) *and also in the sub's sidebar.*\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

The scent on this soap is very strong right off the bat you notice the rose and powder on opening the jar. I bowl lathered this go round as I haven't used anything from Wickham before. I used a bit too much soap and ended up with enough lather for about 2 shaves. The lather is very cushiony and slicker than I was expecting. So performance is top notch and I ended up with a bbs shave with no irritation. The balm was not greasy at all which is good and came out almost gel like. I was a little surprised to have a bit of a burning sensation like an aftershave when I put it on, but that went away pretty quickly. As for the scent, like I said it is very strong off the soap, very floral, powdery and I don't think I am really into it. Lets see what the Mrs thinks but I may end up passing this one along at some point. Definitely would recommend using this soap base, not as slick as B&M but its up there. Have a good weekend everyone!",

After my standard two passes, I still had some rough spots that needed a bit of cleanup. Luckily, the Shannon's Soap was nice and slick. A bare patch a little smaller than a dime has now developed in the center of the tub indicating that the Ring of Death is truly forming. Maybe if we go somewhere warmer for the holidays this year I can bring this tub along and get it killed before summer comes back around.",

Slept in hella hard and then had a lazy morning. Not the norm for me.\n\nI came up with some theme days for myself help bring both order *and* variety to my shaves. Sample Saturday & Sunday (gotta use up dem samples!), Mainstream Monday (gotta use up them ho-hum non-artisan products!), Tubby Tuesday (gotta kill dem big tubs so I can buy more big tubs!), Wildcard Wednesday (whatever I'm craving), Theme Thursday, and Fougère Friday (gotta use up my stupid-large collection of fougère perfumes!). I think I'll mostly stick to that routine for a while unless something special comes up.\n\n*****\n\nI just received my Unscented August prize on Thursday from /u/rocketk455. I'm in Canada so they couldn't ship me sets (border + alcohol = up yours, citizen). Instead I chose a full tub each of Picture Day and Back To School. I also purchased some sample tubs of Homecoming and Field Day. This weekend I'm using the latter because we've been struck by a sudden Autumn heatwave and it smelled the most refreshing off the tub.\n\nI'm not ready to talk about the scent yet - I need to think on it a little more - but the performance? Excellent. Soap's a little soft so I overloaded my brush (oops) and soon had more lather than I could fit on my face so I had to use my ol' brush-soaking teacup as an extra-lather-reservoir. Very nice, very slick and thick and creamy, soaked up lots of water so it didn't dry out too quickly, just fabulous performance all around... even in my rather hard water!\n\nI had sort of assumed that the constant praise for this soap base was part of this sub's tendency to circle-jerk the artisans who hang out with us (and to be fair, many of the artisans who receive our circle-jerks *do deserve them* because they're damned good at what they do), but naw... it deserves all the praise it gets.",

It's a shame it's been so long since I last used it, as the grind is a nice full bellied hollow and it's got a comfy thumb notch with jimping on both sides of the tang. The edge is on the mellow side, but it shaved fine. My only complaint is that the pinning is looser than I prefer, which I recall wanting to fix though I never got a round tuit.\n\nHigh tide is at about 12:45, which makes afternoon swimming at a playground about a mile from our house a strong possibility. Probably one of the last opportunities before the water starts getting too cold for the kids.",

West wind around 10 mph. High tide at 12:52 this afternoon.\n\nAfter reading the parting words from West of Olympia in the new issue of the Wetshaver's Digest there was a bit of talk in IRC about his Seven Sins base and how top notch it is/was. I was unaware that is was a PITA to make, more than his regular base. But at this current juncture in the Soap Base Continuum it ranks right up there BaM, Declaration, Noble Otter, Southern Witchcrafts, and I'm sure I'm forgetting a few.\n\nPride is probably my favorite \"barbershop\" scent. It's clean, and spicy. I don't have an aftershave that really matches it in terms of scent profile. You get the classic barbershop accords, but there is something heavier at play there.\n\nArmada Blossom is one of the closest aftershaves I have in terms of matching scents with Pride. It reminds me of a floral Cologne Russe. I wish that I had been around to pick up a full bottle of this when it was produced, but glad that I was able to snag this.\n\nLooking at my collection of decants this morning, trying to pick out something that would compliment both soap and aftershave, and not overpower the memory of them was on the tougher side. I spied Mitsouko sitting towards the back and was reminded of the light, woody scent, and it goes really well with both of these scents. Again complimentary, but it doesn't completely fill my senses, I can still faintly detect a hint of Armada Blossom, which in turn reminds me Pride.\n\nOver all a great Sunday shave, and one that took a bit more thinking than I normally put into a shave. Have a nice Sunday everyone!",

Think R41 on a bad day, or GEM Micromatic with a bad blade. Ooof. Switched to the Injector.\n\nAlso due to my love for Sandalwoods, I whipped out one of my favorite bases to test theirs. And I cranked it out via a new-to-me Thater size 1 silvertip.\n\n#### ❧ Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Schick - Dial M2 Injector Adjustable ::: Pella Injector ‹3 uses›)*\n\nSo wow, the Ender's blade was so rough and aggressive! After a few swipes, I had to switch to something else. The Schick Injector was nearby so it finished the shave. The Pella blade was in it, and it did okay. I've heard these blades aren't great, and that is bearing out in my experience so far. My neck didn't get a close cut. But it got the job done.\n\nI had the injector at hand because I explained how I had learned that it's blade can be put into the Ender's razor and reportedly makes a sublime shave. But I wanted to try the native Ender's blade first, since the one I had was NOS.\n\n#### ❧ Soap Notes\n*^(Mystic Water Soap - Sandalwood)*\n\nScent: a higher, more pungent, part of the woody scent is on this sandalwood, without as much in the mid-range, to my nose. Makes it similar to the long-gone AoS Tallow Sandalwood or Fine Accoutrements Santal Absolut. Both of which I love as well. So this is a winner Sandalwood to me.\n\nScent Strength: 5/10, adequately present during shaving.\n\nLather: Great performance as usual from MWS. This was a super slick, well-hydrated mix. Great glide with the razor and nice protection.\n\n* 20 sec load with silvertip badger brush\n* 2 tsp water to build the lather\n* = 5 passes of lather.\n\nLather was very workable, slick, including nice lubey rinses ... but for a creamier experience, I may want to back off on the water a bit and mix this one drier than my usual.\n\n\nBowl - I used the XL version of this 3D-printable bowl:\nhttps://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3392930\n\n#### ❧ Brush Notes\n*^(Thater - 4125-1 Black‹1 uses›)*\n\nWhat a world we live in that I can be so picky about the shaving brush I use!! This one was nice and soft, but the short handle makes it more work to stir in the bowl, and your fingers are constantly messy.\n\nBut it felt good and I might consider moving this knot to a different handle. But I could also wait for a larger one to come up for sale.\n\n----\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Very Close Shave\n*Neck*: Many hairs show whisker tips with a little length to them\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm) *and also in the sub's sidebar.*\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

I'm gonna go ahead and lump this one into the same olfactory category as [Tres Matres](https://trythatsoap.com/collection/1182/?product_type=soap_vegan) and [Catalan's Prairie](https://trythatsoap.com/collection/544/?product_type=soap): outwardly floral with earthy undertones.\n\nThey all have something slightly different to offer along with their earthy flowers, though. Of the three, only 3M offers any fruity sweetness and it is also intensely floral. Intensely, I say! It's absolutely vibrant... just sizzling with energy. Catalan's Prairie is more subdued and a bit more woodsy-earthy behind its florals, thanks to a substantial sandalwood base. It feels more fresh and breezy. Field Day mixes its sweet floral notes with a subtle grassy-earthy base as well, but its aquatic notes (and its specific floral choices) give a subtle wink to the Green Irish Tweed / Cool Water accord. It seems the smoothest of the bunch. So... 3M = sweet citrusy floral; CP = earthy breezy floral; Field Day = grassy aquatic floral.\n\nYesterday I finally managed to notice some of the base notes in Aqua Velva's drydown for the first time (i.e. the oakmoss, leather, and amber that usually elude my sniffer). That was a pleasant surprise. Enjoyed it so much that I'm wearing it again today!",

One more paper and a couple of tests to do and that's my day. I had zero idea what to shave with today and the sample of the post shave gel that Maggard's sent me fell out when I opened the cabinet, so boom. Just had to decide what to pair it with. I haven't used Marine in a while so it was a no brainer. The shave itself was wonderful and it was great breaking out a new blade. Nothing like that fresh blade feel on my face! For the aftershave portion of the morning, I have a confession to make. I didn't read the package closely before this morning. I didn't know it was a post shave GEL so I dumped the entire little package in my hand without paying attention to it. Yeah... a little goes a long way with a product like that. Because I'm not a wasteful quitter, I smeared that shit everywhere on my upper body, not just face and neck. The scent is light and pleasant, although not long lasting at all and my skin feels pretty wonderful. I miss the burn of the alcohol and the cooling of the menthol I add to everything, but this is definitely not a bad product. If you've got sensitive skin, this is definitely an option to look into.",

First shave was a success, and the blade may just displace Voskhod. I'll reserve final judgement for a few more shaves.\n\nI did get a bit of irritation but I blame myself for the pursuit of BBS. I did two semi-ATG passes on my neck because I hate seeing stubble immediately after shaving, but my skin usually regrets it.\n\nSouthern Witchcrafts September continues, and I'm really enjoying Tres Matres.

Soap performed well, it was super slick, probably from the glycerin. Scent wise, I picked up none of the sandalwood. The scent is already very mild and not very strong, and to not be able to pick out the sandalwood was unfortunate. I'm liking the hardware from these last two shaves, though. Just got the top cap and straight bar C plate from Karve, as I still have a bunch of handles that my brother made for me on his lathe, and I'm really impressed with this razor's performance. I can't wait to use it once I get back from Vegas. New Semogue boar brush seems to be breaking in nicely and faster than my Omegas and my Stirling. I'm wondering why I haven't picked one of these up before now.\n\nY'all enjoy the rest of your weekend and the week ahead. Hopefully my trip to Vegas will be productive, but I doubt it.",

Really hot and humid. I should have used this setup yesterday, but I'm using it today regardless. It's going to be hot today, too, so there's that.\n\nThe first time I used P&B was a few years ago when they first released soaps. It was their leather scent. I thought it was nice, but never followed up, and returned it to its owner that loaned it to me. This is a similar boat, but I have more thoughts. It seems a lot softer than the one I tried before, *shrug. It loads a little easier than Italian soft soaps, but suffers from the foamy start if your brush is too wet, the same thing Italian soft soaps suffer from. I use the word suffer like it's some horrible flaw, but it isn't lol, I just need to remember to use a dry brush next time. Well not DRY dry, just not dripping with water =P\n\nI had a nice chilly mentholated, damn fine shave today, and I'm loving it!!!\n\nHave a good'n folks!\n\nDFS",

I really like both the soap and the AS, but I think I like the AS a lot more as the soap isn't as strongly scented as I'd like. I'm going to try the AS with Moon Soap's Ameretto Speciale in the future and see how they pair. THB's Decadence AS bottle is so big that it won't matter if I mix and match it with other soaps.\n\nThank you again, u/BourbonInExile, I'm really glad to have this set and I didn't think I'd ever actually find one!",

I'm considering picking up samples of Zoologist Squid and Dodo.\n\nI have been using Texaus splash the last few shaves, grateful to get a sample from /u/Hyvasuomi79, and it's really nice!\n\n/u/chiseledface recommended this BR171 razor as a great updated Tech clone, and I have to agree it's great quality for the price. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this one to a brand new wet shaver especially! I like the long handle as well.\n\nI may have found a new favorite batch of Declaration hair in B8. Incredibly dense, plenty of backbone, and those tips are soft and gelled. Still hasn't beaten out my B6 unicorn, but it's close.\n\nHope you guys get great shaves today!",

WTG, XTG, and another XTG clean up. Soap worked well; it was a bit thin at the beginning but after loading more, it became better. Brush felt great but it did have some trouble loading the soap. I need to control the water retention a bit better. The razor + blade felt good but the blade is getting slightly rougher. I could tell it by the post shave as the alum block stung all around my face. Mild stings but overall, a very nice shave.\n\nSo many products to try out and review. I still have some brushes, soaps, and razors to try out. For next week, I'm planning to feature some of the SE razors with some familiar soaps and brushes. I'll look into couple synthetics to use and take out decent shaving sticks as well.",

RIP.\n\n#### ❧ Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Wolfman - WR2 SB .95 High Polish ::: Gillette - Silver Blue ‹12 uses›)*\n\nThe feel of this razor is outstanding. I like this lower gap. I still got a crazy efficient shave. So much that there was no use in doing a 3rd pass! Seriously. Has maybe happened to me once or twice ... ever.\n\nGSB, even one with 11 uses on it, sliced through the stubble so cleanly. I could feel an edge, as it glided across my face, but not a harsh or sharp one.\n\nWonderful balance between efficiency and comfort.\n\n#### ❧ Soap Notes\n*^(Reef Point Soaps - Test Depth)*\n\nThem: crisp, modern, clean and masculine, with notes of citrus, water lily, mulberry and vetiver amber.\n\nScent: I liked this scent. Though the citrus is forward, but not overly so, I could still pick out a few of the other notes. I guessed at amber, but I think it was really the mulberry I was smelling. Didn't get much floral or vetiver, but I'm sure they're present and acting to make the scent more deep.\n\nMost importantly, the wife liked it!\n\nScent Strength: 4/10, lightly present during shaving.\n\nLather: excellent. Creamy and slick. Too bad the company had to shut down. I know they had lots of competition, but this soap deserves some accolades and a place near the top, IMO.\n\nPerformed really well! Silky sheen throughout, and great protection. This one can get nice and elastic when it is properly hydrated. But still stays creamy.\n\n* 20 sec load with a lightly wet, dense badger brush\n* 2.5 tsp water to build the lather\n* = 4 passes of lather\n\nBowl - I used the XL version of this 3D-printable bowl:\nhttps://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3392930\n\n#### ❧ Brush Notes\n*^(Maggard Razors - SHD 26 mm - Super High Density‹6 uses›)*\n\nWish I would have let it soak a bit longer to relax it more. But I forgot to put in in water ahead of time. Takes some effort to splay and scrub, but feels pretty good when doing it. And definitely feels better in the latter passes.\n\n----\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Cut flush to where I just see the tips (above average for me)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm) *and also in the sub's sidebar.*\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

I've used the white stuff a lot in the past but this was my first time using the green. Much more menthol in this one and the scent ~~nicely~~ complimented my Skin Bracer, which I recently spiked with a little bit of glycerin and witch hazel... curious to see how it performs this way in the cooler months.\n\nDecided that plucky little Lord Classic had enough shaves at a dozen... Far more than I expected of it! Going to move this Wilkinson blade over to my Fatip tomorrow and see what it's like there.\n\nI tried out Platinum Egoiste a few weeks ago and over-applied (oops) so I had to wash it off because it was way too strong. Planning to wander to the mall again at coffee time today and try a lighter application to see if it might be a good acquisition for next year's summer frags, as I have often heard that it performs and smells best in hot weather.",

Maggard V3 head is better in this respect but I find the V3 to be more aggressive. In any case shave was fine.",

The shower allowed me to use my last of the Satsuma bath soap and two bars of Red Delicious are up ahead for early autumn. Also, since returning from a few days postpartum with our baby, I realized the combination of dry hospital air and lacking my normal skincare/shaving routine really wrecked my skin - dry, cracked, peeling. Added a few extra elements to the shave - a glycerin soap pre shave wash, and Cetaphil + Aquaphor on top of the CL toner. That seems to have helped quite a bit overnight, but I might stick with this for one or two more shaves since paternity leave allows me the time to dedicate to it. Have a great Monday, all. Cheers!",

I was rushed to pack for my trip, and as a result, I forgot to pack a few things, so I'll be heading out to do some shopping this evening. Flight delays with the airline I had booked with resulted in getting moved to a different carrier, so I had to leave the gate area, go back to the ticket counter, and then back through security. I had gate change, that I didn't hear any announcement for, that took me from one end of a terminal to the other. And finally, my room smells like a locker room.\n\nBut, I had really nice shave with Southern Witchcrafts Sandalwood this morning, so I got that going for me. I've used this soap sample before, and I remember really liking the scent. It's just a very simple sandalwood, and it is very similar to the Stirling Sandalwood that I will be using later this month.\n\nHave a good Monday everyone.",

Though not harsh by any measure, the SG AC shaves much worse than other alleged \"mild\" AC blades. My face always seems a little bit more sore and red with SoftGuard than it does with Proguard, Kai Titans milds, or even the \"mainstream\" Proline. Add in the high price for the Softguard, and I think this will be my last pack of them.\n\n**Brush:** Gorgeous and comfy handle, but the 27mm non-SHD performance is simply adequate rather than excellent. The head bloomed quite a bit over time so now looks more like a 30mm, but there has been no hair loss or breakage. It's OK, given the price point, but I feel Elite gives you more for not much more of a price. Maybe the new Maggard SHD is a better answer.\n\n**Post**: Stirling balms offer a great balance of price, performance and interesting scents. Though dupes of frags are not my thing, I don't mind smelling pseudo-Creed in a balm that works well to soothe and moisturize.\n\n**Frag**: Spiced celery, patchouli, and minty incense.

I think I was at the 25+ range with my previous \"military special\" blade.\n\nZoologist and Chiseled Face have a pretty amazing collaboration going on, and I was ecstatic to see Camel as an offering a few months ago (a lot of months ago? I bought it before I deployed to the Middle East). Camel is a really pleasant blend of floral, spicy, and sweet, capturing the allure of the Middle East without relying on a blast of oud. Rose, dates (dried fruit is the official note), and incense stand on a musk and oud platform. They really captured all of my pleasant memories of walking into a corner store in the Middle East. I really want to get the matching frag, but probably can't justify the purchase with how many I have right now.\n\nI haven't heard about any new Chiseled Face/Zoologist collabs coming up, but I'm hoping that they don't stop!",

      "body": "[Today's Shave](https://imgur.com/a/DCMZrz7)\n\nPrep: The coldest shower I could take\n\nLather: Mitchell's Wool Fat\n\nBrush: 28mm Envy Shave Manchurian in early stainless Carnavis & Richardson Chubby\n\nRazor: Rex Ambassador 4 / 4 / 3\n\nBlade: Wizamet Iridium Super Extra Stainless (4)\n\nPost: L'Occitane Cade Aftershave Balm\n\nToday, I felt a need to get back to the all time classic, Mitchell's Wool Fat. I did use it maybe a month ago as well, but it was a quick one or two pass, and didn't even post a SOTD that day. So today I am.\n\nThis soap was relegated to brush defunkifying duty years ago. Basically because didn't like making lather with it. It took a while to get the right approach, and I just didn't have the patience to do that at the time. Well that and I also had a ton of other soaps that didn't tKe any effort, so, as the saying goes, \"why bother?\"\n\nOver the years, my technique has improved, and I have more patience too (in shaving matters anyway lol), and I have figured out a great approach to using this classic. I start by putting some water on the top of the puck. Not a lot, just a layer dripped from dunking my brush in warm water. I let it sit for a while. Basically before I start getting things ready to go in the shower, I begin this process. That brings me to this brush. This brush is a knot I purchased when Envy Ahave was new, and his knots were all the hype. \"Soft tips! Good backbone!\" they said. Well they were right about the backbone. It's solid. Really solid lol. The tips on the other hand.... I think I got a dud, because mine was/is absolutely NOT soft. It's on the another level. It's maybe like B3, but more scrubby, and more backbone. A lot more backbone. I HATED it. It's also a 26mm knot, that had a glue bump so big it wouldn't fit in a 28mm socket. So, I never set it. This knot sat in a box for years before I rediscovered it.\n\nWhen Carnavis & Richardson first began making machines brush handles, this was the first shape. It's inspired by a Chubby style, but is unique in its own. The down side with these, is that he was still learning, and didn't consider just how heavy they were. This thing is a TANK! It's drilled out a little, but I can definitely see (and FEEL LOL) it could use a little more finessing inside to lighten it up a bit. In fact, it would probably be more suited to a Ti build it's just a heavy design!\n\nAnyhow, one day I saw this handle on the bazaar for a good price, and I was feeling like I needed this in my life, so I bought it. Upon receipt, and feeling just how heavy this beast is, I immediately thought of this Envy knot. I thought how the weight of thosnhandle\nCould possibly tame the beast of a knot I had banished to obscurity in the depths of my shave gear collection. It's a good thing O did, because they're a perfect pair! The weight did take the backbone. The scritch, not so much. BUT, personally, I have grown to appreciate knots of the like. Not for every day use, but occasions like today when I feel like using this setup.\n\nThe caveat of using this setup, is if I drop it, it is **ABSOLUTELY** going to cause some damage. Either to my tub, or my toe, or my floor. If someone has some sort of stone or ceramic tile, I can absolutely see this brush leaving a mark. So, I use absolute caution not to drop it!\n\nAnyhow, I had great shave using these items I thought I would never appreciate =)\n\nDFS for me HELL YEAH!!!\n\nHope everyone is recovering nicely from your weekend!",

WTG, XTG, and another XTG clean up. Soap worked well. It gave me a creamy and semi-slick lather. Brush felt good painting but splaying it was a bit troublesome. It has a bit more scrub than I would like so I'm thinking of passing it on. Razor felt nice. First time SE shaving and it was pretty similar to DE except slightly rougher. With the long handle, it allowed for a relatively comfortable shave. Mild post shave to wrap it all up.\n\nI'll probably use this SE for couple weeks or so. I like to use up my blade before changing my razor and I hear that these blades last 10-15 shaves. Although I would like to switch up more razors, I'll stick to this Schick for now. I'll still be trying out different brushes and soaps. Maybe some shaving sticks and new soaps that I have not tried.",

The head on the 6c is a little big and it's tough to get up under my nose with the minimal blade exposure.\n\n\nI like sporting lavender and I like sporting wood. That makes Flowers in the Dark such a great fragrance for me. Lavender good. Cedar good. The TNeV EdP doesn't really have a through line but wow is it great. I'm ready to slay.",

Granted, it won't cool down in this part of the country for a few more months, but I still try to keep everything swapped out accordingly. That's the only way I'll get everything in my den used! Went with West Egg today and I swear I'm surprised by house exuberant it smells every time I use it. Seriously smells like a party in a tub/bottle. That pop of the champagne accord really does brighten up this scent big time. The Storybook base is always a joy to use. I load everything a bit heavy and just a good dunk in water later, it's ready to explode in lather. The CL aftershave always makes my skin feel great and the EdP smells amazing. Great stuff and just what I needed after getting ass raped at work yesterday. I needed a pick-me-up today for sure and this scratches that itch well.",

Todays lather was generously provided to me by u/Hyvasuomi79. Typical NO lather thick, shiny, and slicker than owl snot on a wet doorknob. I don't acctually know how slick that is but the gentleman I picked it up from seemed to use it as his superlative for slickness and I like the WTF looks I get when I use it. The scent to me is straight up black tea. Not tea thats been brewed but the scent of the loose tea before you steep it. I dont get any other notes and to be honest I'm perfectly OK with that, I like the smell of tea. However while I do see myself getting a tub in the near future I do not see my self getting the matching AS with it. Maybe I wil get more notes with tomorrows use and that will change but right now it looks like it will join B&Ms 42 as a scent I like as a soap but not a post\n\nSBS Icy Stare. What can I say, I'm becoming a huge fan of synthetic menthol. Not that I don't like Cryogen, but I like the way this starts out with almost no coolness (kinda like WTH guys did you forget something?), then builds to a pleasant state of coolness that hangs around for a good twenty minutes. Stay smooth and have a great day.",

REALLY good stuff. If you've only read about it and haven't tried it go give it a whirl somehow. Lather was as it should be and was very friendly for the way I dialed it in today.\n\nFirst go for me with a scent like this - I haven't even smelled the one it was inspired by. I like it though and can see why it's immensely popular. Definitely one I want to keep around (thanks /u/MadDingers Yo).\n\nFelt like this one warmed my face a bit which was kind of an interesting sensation. Not sure if I'm sensitive to something in there or what but it wasn't like a reaction or anything. Just felt warm here and there - nothing to even slow me down from using it regularly.\n\nDang near ready to put a PIF out there - couple more days max. Gonna be hardware focused.\n\nHope today looks like a Tuesday and not Monday V2.0 for y'all today.",

I'm a grateful beast. Such a good soap!\n\n#### ❧ Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Wolfman - WR2 SB .95 High Polish ::: Bolzano ‹6 uses›)*\n\nMan, this razor is sweet. Even treated me well with the Bolzano, which sometimes is rough. My right side of the face it was tuggy on, but everywhere else it was nice enough. Very odd ... I've had that happen before. But no problems.\n\nNo irritation, just a sweet smooth cut.\n\n#### ❧ Soap Notes\n*^(Summer Break Soaps v1 - Picture Day)*\n\nThem: \"my interpretation of a barbershop style scent... starts off with lavender and bergamot... Rosemary and black pepper are present as middle notes. The base is oakmoss, patchouli, and tonka bean\"\n\nScent: I was able to pick out the lavender, rosemary, pepper, and something of the base notes. I think it is really well done. It doesn't seem to be a match with an existing barbershop that I've tried, but it is firmly in that genre... which I imagine is hard to do. I thoroughly enjoyed the shave and lather.\n\nand here's even better news.... the scent is strong enough! I'm a stickler for at least medium level scents, and though I've loved several of Summer Break's offerings, most were a bit too calm for me. Save of course, History 101 which is a studly concoction for sure. Now I get to keep History AND Picture Day in my den!\n\nScent Strength: 5/10, nicely present during shaving.\n\nLather: This one was superb. Started a bit dry, but wetted it up and I had glide, great smells, and protection up the wazoo.\n\nGreat job on this one, /u/rocketk455... seriously.\n\n+ 1/4 tsp plus soap\n+ lightly wet, silvertip badger brush\n+ 5 tsp water added to make lather\n+ = 6 passes of lather\n\n\nBowl - I used the XL version of this bowl:\nhttps://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3392930\n\n#### ❧ Brush Notes\n*^(Maseto - Memphis Silvertip 24mm‹15 uses›)*\n\nThis is becoming one of my favorite badgers. Soft, but enough backbone to keep the softness on my face. Makes great lather. And I'm getting used to the thin waist of the Memphis handle.\n\n----\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Cut flush to where I just see the tips (above average for me)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm) *and also in the sub's sidebar.*\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

Today's shave was immensely pleasant and efficient - probably won't last as long as an AC shave, but the pleasant feel during the shave was worth it.\n\nAlso, the Astra SP Renaissance is great to experience! This long neglected and cheap blade has proven to be as sharp as my other cheapie fave Vokshod, and also lasts about twice as long as the Voks.\n\n**Lather:** Lovely vanilla bourbon and wood scent in a fine base that achieves my highest FAYS score.\n\n**Post:** One of the Best Big Box Balms. The hint of menthol soothes well, and the caffeine seems to reduce redness a bit as promised. The balm also is a good daily moisturizer, so is a nice one stop solution.\n\n**Frag:** Spicy apparently authentic sandalwood from the subcontinent - not Mysore though, but with a great scent like this, it's hard to care.",

Since it's Tuesday why not go with a tobacco scent today. WK Merchant of Tobacco is such a great scent and the performance is always top notch. Getting more comfortable with my Blackbird, definitely is taking a bit of an adjustment from my Rockwell 6S\n\nHave a great day everyone!",

Two, through the use of samples I want to find scents to buy in a full tub. Tres Matres is that scent.\n\nGood shave today. Instead of pushing a 4th pass, I just buffed a little bit. The Perma Sharp blade is nice, but maybe a touch harsher on my face than Voskhod. Or maybe I didn't quite dial in the lather today. Or both.",

I can't pick them apart as they are very well blended and don't stick out, besides the lime. The lime doesn't fall to the back during the shave, but the base notes do start to stick their head out even more, or they just become more apparent after smelling them for a while. The lavender seems to bring out a spiciness out of the woods(cedar and fir) and smoke seems to hold hands with the sandalwood. Once you get used to the lime, you can totally see that this scent shares a close relationship with Gothique, albeit much brighter and less dark. This is even more evident when you splash on the aftershave.",

This was my first, what you may call, 'artisan' shaving soap, and it had an impressive list of ingredients, including tallow, brazil nut oil,and cocoa seed butter to name a few. The scent is like sweet almonds and cocoa. Shave was very good, excellent slickness and cushion from the soap. I will definitely return to this soap again and again.\n\n**Imaginary Authors Sundrunk:** This was also my first real fragrance that I've ever tried, and i really liked the scent. The description for it says the scent notes are Neroli, Rhubarb, Honeysuckle, Rose Water and Orange Zest. Out of those, i definitely picked up on the Rhubarb, Honeysuckle and Rose Water. A great scent for a warm summer day.\n\nOverall, great shave today, had a few weepers on the neck, but they closed right up.\n\nPitter Patter, boys.",

WTG, XTG, and another XTG clean up. Soap worked decently, giving a good menthol chill to the face. Brush was in its initial stage so it ate up all the lather. Still need to break it in and load heavier next time. Razor + blade was decent but slightly rough on the face; I did have some zings on some spots so I got to be careful. Mild post shave to wrap it all up.\n\nA bit late but I still want to put this out. I wish I can put out the SOTD in the morning but work takes priority for obvious reasons.. Late night posts will have to do for some days. Anyways, I've been really enjoying my setup and new products. The brush feels nice and revisiting older menthol soaps is a great feeling. I'll be continuing to rotate my soaps and brush while keeping the same razor + blade setup for a while. I'm thinking of using the triple-milled razorock blue soap tomorrow.",

It's all downhill from there. Actually, from what I understand it's a mix of horse hair and goat hair. It smells terrible, and it tangled after 1 use. Avoid at all costs.\n\nFenchurch and Grand Havana, however, are delightful. Wonderful tobacco scents. Grand Havana is very underrated, and I'm surprised it never got a lot of attention. It's tobacco and vanilla.",

Being a beginner, having only used proraso, and reading about how great Executive Man, Stirling Barbershop were in everyone's posts, I jumped on it. I got samples of those two, Sharp Dressed Man, Ozark Mountain, and a sample of Ship Wreck Cove, so I've had it for a while. It gets good compliments from the wife, and it reminds me of one of those teenage clothing stores where if you walk by one, even from the far side of the walk-way, you get a good lung-full of the cologne pouring out of it. Maybe it's not that bad, because I don't mind it myself, but that is still the easiest way to describe it. Like my last sample, this one had dried out a bit over the years.\n\nI went to the container store last night to design a new closet system (my wife's idea with her own closet) and I couldn't help but imagine the pull-out shelves would help greatly with my wetshaving storage...",

Terror is cold. The fragrance is perfect for what it is trying to accomplish and very well done. I don't find the scent all that exciting but I certainly appreciate it. I had tried this sample a couple of times already so now only have a few shaves left on it. That will be plenty to form my opinion on the comparison of the three B&M bases.",

SBS base continues to impress me with the performance. Scent strength on this one is about normal. Still need another shave or two to comment on the fragrance itself. Pairing it with a few more fougères but there aren't a lot of cross-over notes so hopefully the soap won't leave me nose-blind to the splash and the splash won't leave me nose-blind to the perfume. Hate it when that happens (unless I'm doing it strategically, which I will likely do this Friday).",

Today? PdP number 63. And true to what he said it smells EXACTLY like the number 63. The scent profile is good, strength on the mild side (or so it might seem with my busted ass sniffer) but extremely enjoyable overall. This is my first non-tallow shave soap, so that was a new experience for me. I didn't quiiiiiiite dial in the later right today but that might be because my dopey ass lathered right off the puck in the tin like some kind of animal versus maybe scooping and bowl lathering or something. Still it was a good lather and I'm excited to try it again with a little more forethought.\n\nThe Persona is doing good work - better than the Voskhod I used before but not sure where it ranks with the Gillettes. Such fun doing all this blade experimentation now that I've got a razor I know I like.\n\nThat ole PIF coming up might be getting a bit bigger if I can swing something here that'll let me do that. Stay tuned - shooting for Friday.\n\nIt's hump day - get out there and do the stuff.",

Strangely enough this made me both happy and sad. While I like the overall scent more than I did yesterday I also missed the basic black tea scent that I was enthralled with yesterday. While I enjoy and appreciate some of the scents that todays artisans are creating, I am a simple man and I enjoy the simple pleasures of life. Still not sure on the AS, although, oddly enough, the thought of the EdT is more appealing.\n\nThe Cologne Russe was a sample I bought when I found a bottle of MLS Grand Hvana (WOO!) and wanted something else to justify the shipping charges. I paired it with the NeV because I had vague recollections of it having fruity and floral notes but right now I don't have any impression of it other than \"It smells good\". It seems to pair well. Have a great day today and I'll be back Friday as tomorrow morning at zero dark thirty I will be out feeding fish. Yay me!",

This piece of music, affectionately called \"Fingal's Cave\", was based on the cave of the same name found in the Hebrides, which are some of the outer islands north of the Scottish mainland. Another beautiful piece of music I'd played in my college symphony orchestra that was a joy to perform.\n\nToday's Daily Stoic reading is **Dealing With Pain**: \"Whenever you suffer pain, keep in mind that it's nothing to be ashamed of and that it can't degrade your guiding intelligence, nor keep it from acting rationally and for the common good. And in most cases you should be helped by the saying of Epicurus, that pain is never unbearable or unending, so you can remember these limits and not add them in your imagination. Remember too that many common annoyances are pain in disguise, such as sleepiness, fever and loss of appetite. When they start to get you down, tell yourself you are giving into pain.\" - Marcus Aurelius, *Meditations*, 7.64\n\nGood words to remember, and I would add another fitting quote (particularly for Hump Day) from Winston Churchill: \"If you're going through Hell, keep on going.\"",

I think this is the longest I've gone in a year. I was in Los Angeles for a wedding and my fiancée likes a little stubble. I usually win this battle but I got some goodwill by leaving a little fuzz on the face.\n\nThis also gave me a chance to use the open comb plate on my Tatara Masamune. My take is the same as when I previously used it after 1.5 days and that is that it has too much blade feel for my taste. The solid bar plate is plenty efficient enough so I just don't see a need for the open comb.\n\nOver all it's great to back home shaving in my bathroom. I have no idea whether or not it's the water or why else I consistently struggle to get good lather away from home.",

That's AC territory! Very impressive. The 100mm CG handle feels soooo much better to use than comparably sized handles from Timeless or Ikon. The Torpedo has many useful grip points and a finely tuned balance. It's the four inch handle for those who hate four inch handles!\n\n**Lather:** My favorite scent in the SW line as sniffed to date. (Not sniffed any of the new stuff - DesiRay, 3 Moms, Sardine) but Druantia is both dark and pretty at the same time, a perfect start of Fall scent.\n\n**Frag:** Speaking of perfect Fall scents! Possibly the most interesting sandalwood on the planet, as the structure can be analyzed really precisely. The sandalwood is really well balanced with the spicier notes, which is quite hard to do. Except for Perfume Genius Dudes.",

Let me tell you (only one shave I know), but this is like the best of the Icarus world and the Bison world all rolled into one. It has all the best characteristics of Icarus with the easier-to-use nature and consistency of the Bison base (although I'm in the camp that doesn't think Icarus takes that much more effort to lather). Elite level slickness and although I used a mild razor, protection is also top notch. I'm going to continue testing (obvs) with more aggressive razors and such so stay tuned. The addition of a few new ingredients also makes this soap create a SUPER creamy lather as you can hopefully see from the pic. I'm excited to eventually get some new scents from Scoot in this wonderful base in the coming months.",

So coming at it from a blind mans perspective, this razor is awesome. I think what I noticed more than anything was firmly it held the blade in place. There are multiple areas on my chin I have problems with going XGT/AGT, but with this razor it didn't seem to feel it at all. If I could afford this razor, I would buy it.",

It has gone on for more than two months of face shaves and head shaves. I have been able to see the bottom of the container for more than two weeks now. I feel committed to this but I am so ready to sue something else. Don't get me wrong, I love Bell Ringer and love Summer Break Soaps. But this just has to end. I think I realistically have one or two shaves at the most left now. I wish I would have turned to the badger sooner. I may shave my head tonight and see if I can finish it up. Right now I feel like I am in shaving prison, marking the days on the wall in chalk. Or whatever they always do in those movies.",

The Feather is a bit old, but I wanted to try it in this razor. It was okay. And then another hit on my recently-acquired Thater, and I think I learned that the handle is just too short for me, since I bowl lather so much.\n\n#### ❧ Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Wolfman - WR2 SB .95 High Polish ::: Feather ‹41 uses›)*\n\nIt worked okay, but with a little tugging, since this Feather has had so many uses. Kinda expected that, but just wanted to see. But pass 2 and 3 were great.\n\nAfter I put this razor through a few other blades, I'll try a younger Feather.\n\n#### ❧ Soap Notes\n*^(L&L Grooming Bison Tallow - Southern Paradise)*\n\nThem: Peaches, Sweet Tea, Ocean\n\nScent: Not overly sweet of a scent, but peach tea for sure. And the Ocean note is there, just quiet. If you weren't looking for it, you might miss it.\n\nPlus, this one has a little bit of menthol in it. Not enough to bother me, fortunately.\n\nScent Strength: 5/10, nicely present during shaving.\n\nLather: slick excellent awesome, as we all know from this base.\n\n* 25 second load with lightly-wet, large, badger brush\n* 2 tsp water to build the lather\n* = 4 passes of lather.\n\nBowl - I used the XL version of this 3D-printable bowl:\nhttps://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3392930\n\n#### ❧ Brush Notes\n*^(Thater - 4125-1 Black‹2 uses›)*\n\nI like this knot pretty well, but the handle is just too short for a bowl latherer like me. Hands get too messy. And there are other 3-band knots I like just as much, or more, like my Whipped Dog ST, Maseto ST, and my Kent BK8.\n\n----\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Just a little tugging\n*Neck*: Just a little tugging\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Few hairs are showing some tip length (with most being cut flush)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm) *and also in the sub's sidebar.*\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

North wind around 5 mph becoming calm. High tide at 3:17 this afternoon.\n\nLast night I was looking through my den seeing what samples I could scrounge up. I came up with 4: Santa Maria Novella - Crema di Barba; Siliski Soaps - Midnight in Tunisia; Southern Witchcrafts - Druantia; and Oleo Soapworks - No. 11. They were all in wildly different containers so I was unable to put them in a bag to pick them, due to not picking randomly. They got laid out on the counter and had the daughter pick a number from 1-12. She picked 7. That came up with Oleo No. 11.\n\nFirst go around with any Oleo base and it was the duck fat base as well. The size of the \"sample\" was about the size of a Stirling sample, so once it was pressed into a bigger container loading was a breeze. Performance was top notch. I can't believe that I've been sleeping on these products all this time. I am not a fan of the scent. It's sharp and chemical to my nose, not something I want to be smelling at 3:30 in the morning. I will probably give it another go on Saturday, when I'm not up so damn early, let it try to redeem itself.\n\nActually had a sample of Henri et Victoria balm laying around, not sure where it came from. Performed nicely. Went on a bit more greasy than I would have liked, but absorbed fairly well. Face feels very nice now, about 20 minutes after application. The scent is on the lighter side, and while not offensive, not something that I feel any need to pick up.\n\nHave a very nice Thursday everyone!",

Yesterday was one of those days where nothing remarkable happened in my life but it was just an all around great day. Got extra stuff done at work, left early enough to see my fiance before she went to work, made a good dinner, worked out, and cleaned the house.\n\nNow about the shave: Tabac is a good stand by when you don't know what to use. The scent isn't popular with everyone (I believe pooter once made a comparison involving geriatric diapers) but I like it and it's mild enough to go with anything if matching scents is your thing. The lather though, the lather is thicc as fuck if you load properly and super slick to match. Then we got the stag. This is a sample that I used once a while back and the only thing I remembered was that my fiance did not like it...at all. Turns out I do. Sure, I guess I can understand why you wouldn't want to smell like this around your friends, family, and co-workers but there's something in there that I fucking love. So if any of you crazies that bought a full set with the edt for August want to be rid of it, hit me up.",

Was very surprised with how the Perma Sharps performed. Really sharp but barely any razor burn or nicks, even in problematic places. I hope the blade holds a similar performance the next few shaves!",

Its still fairly warm during the day here in the UK but the mornings have that cold bite to them. If it carries on like this the Fourth and Pine might live to see another year before it gets killed off as its really a warm weather scent for me.\n\nThe shave itself was great, recently I've been doing a single WTG pass to combat irritation but realised recently I've been applying more pressure than I should go get a smooth shave. 2 Passes today with minimal pressure, no irritation and smoother than normal with only a slight bit more time taken. Great shave.\n\nReached for something more autumn-ey today for a fragrance. I actually thought that Canfield Cedar had some citrus in to compliment the F&P but I was completely wrong, its straight up wood. Its a nice compliment and works really well. It basically smells like stepping into a Sauna, seriously considering a full size bottle after I kill this sample.",

It's fantastic. I don't love rose or sandalwood that much alone, but together it's really a beautiful combination. I'm going to need to get the splash or toner. If anybody has one to sell please pm me.",

It totally nails the Animal Cracker scent. Thankfully I have young children and we keep a small stock of animal crackers for car trips, so I was able to verify the quality of the match shortly after my shave. I will probably be picking up the matching splash soon to complete the set. I don't have anything in my den that I think would compliment this soap.\n\nThe performance was very good. Easy to load and it created a good slick lather with very little effort. Post shave was also good.\n\nHappy Thursday!",

I snagged a good deal on a refill puck which I grated into a Maggards container. I like rose scented soaps, and had read descriptions of CS #88 as a \"dirty rose\". I don't get any rose, unless they meant ground up stems or leaves or something like that. I do not detect the rose flower, not even a little bit. The scent, whatever it is, strikes me as slightly odd, and it has not particularly grown on me. I do find the performance excellent, so there is that. It is very slick, and I like slick. It is a very hard soap. This is one mean puck that wants to outlive me. But that's a war I intend to win.\n\nThat whole \"dirty rose\" thing got wanting a suitably dirty tune for this shave. Enter Hayseed Dixie. Chances are you've heard the original Aerosmith version of \"Walk This Way\", and the later Aerosmith/Run DMC version. They are great, but they are missing something. Hayseed Dixie's cover of the song turns the vaguely suggestive lyrics into a burning roadside flare of pure filth. Through sheer delivery, mind you. They don't change the lyrics. Also, bonus mega jaw harp. Forget cowbell, more jaw harp!",

It's kind of a big deal since proceeds go to ovarian cancer research and my wife is a survivor of ovarian cancer herself. She was diagnosed and subsequently underwent a hysterectomy 6 months before we met and began dating. She's been cancer free ever since then, but still of course has to follow up with her doctor regularly. My wife is a blessing and an inspiration and I figured I'd dedicate today's shave to her.\n\n\nThis is my first use of a Talbot soap and it's pretty damn wonderful. Great slickness and cushion and it didn't leave my face feeling all dry and shitty. I got a great shave with it today! The aftershave splash from Maol is damn amazing as well. Whatever extras he puts in there are fucking fantastic and I've GOT ago try to find other scents that I can incorporate into my den. Two thumbs up like a motherfucker!\n\n\nThe final piece of the puzzle today is my fragrance. My wife's favorite scent on me is Aventus, of course. I've gotta get my hands on a decent decant since I just used the last of a little smidgeon I traded for. It's pretty great and I'm glad she enjoys something this much. Just wish it was cheaper because I haven't found a clone that's close enough imo.\n\nToday was a great shave in honor of a great woman. Can't say enough good things about her. She's stepped in and has turned my two kids from my first marriage into her own to the point that SHE is who they call momma and they just typically refer to the ex by her first name when she's not around. She's caring and loving and exhibits Grace and charm in ways I never thought possible. I'm a lucky man.",

I've been a table-top gamer for, like, a quarter century, so pulling objects out of a bag (of holding)? Nah. But assigning every item a number and then rolling a variety of oddly shaped dice to find out which equipment the fates want me to use? Heckin' yes.\n\nSuper Speed and a Gillette blade? A dependable combination. Giant SynBad brush that barely fits on my face? Far from the worst option in my collection. A soap and splash that both feature tea, citrus, and berries? And then one of the perfume samples I pulled out of my jar even featured tea, bergamot, and wild fig? That actually worked out pretty nicely and I even got three kinds of tea: black, green, and Moroccan.\n\nLady Luck must be smiling on me today. Quite glad I didn't get stuck with something like a Derby blade and clashing scents like SW Alchemist soap, Sandpiper splash, and Acqua di Gio perfume... which was entirely within the realm of possibility. Definitely dodged a bullet this morning!",

But it's too late to do anything about that now.\n\nMoving forward...\n\nClassic barbershop is widely done across the artisan world. Ariana & Evans Barbiere Sofisticato didn't do much to set itself apart when it comes to scent. Subtle and not very potent it has a slightly sweet smell. The performance is incredible as always. I did get a decent face burn though. Not sure which fragrance oil did that but I'll have to move this onto the next person.\n\nAs a lover of all things prehistoric, this Elite Razor amber handle strokes my über nerdiness perfectly. Whatever the inclusions are, I think it's damn cool that I'm now shaving with them millions and millions of years after they were trapped in tree resin.\n\nI got my Lupo back from a friend who had it on loan so I immediately fired it up. I love this little razor. I have been stalking Italian Barber in hopes of getting lucky and stumbling upon a Stainless Lupo but this far no luck.",

It was great fun to do the bobbing not knowing what would come out but confident it'd be awesome.\n\nI went bobbing today JUST in the sample\nbag from that amazing PIF /u/MadDingersYo laid out.\n\nI underloaded the bowl with soap just a bit. Part of me hates seeing samples or tubs run out so I try to get too many shaves out of them. I need to just agree with myself that a sample gives no more than 3 shaves and get over it.\n\nBut man that scent! I remember when I thought getting a bottle of DN would solve all my social problems in the early 90s. Once I finally got one as you might imagine it didn't but it was still thrilling to think for awhile there it might.\n\nGreat shave - wish I would have gotten my hands on some MLS before they moved on but super glad I got to try it.\n\nIt's Friday eve y'all, go have a good one.",

It worked out well since this sample probably wouldn't have been used for a while due to my little B&M three base experiment that's just finishing up.\n\nThe shave was beautiful. The Reserve Base is amazing. I kept the old school fragrance theme going with West Egg and really like that classic fragrance as well.",

The winning sample was Henri Et Victoria's Cognac and Cuban Cigars.\n\nI'm not sure if it was the vegan or tallow base but it smelled and performed great. I got a masculine tobacco scent that is pleasant but not overly floral. I didn't feel like scrambling to look for a splash so I kept it simple and used CL's unscented aftershave. My frag options are limited so the only thing I could think of that has tobacco and leather is VoA which made it a quick and easy decision.",

I want to try and throw as many different variables as I can at this soap so today I went with a synthetic brush. I started out damp and slowly added small amounts of water to build up the lather. I know the marco method is all the rage right now, but this is my preferred method. I will marco it eventually too. I got the same consistent results as yesterday. Super easy to create a dense, creamy, and super slick lather. Residual slickness is the star of the show which I think is one of, if not the most important trait of a shaving soap. You can go over areas you've already shaved with reckless abandon without worry of causing any irritation. I went with my usual daily razor the GC 0.84 which is a bit more aggressive than the Silversmith. No issues whatsoever. Great lather and shave today. I will eventually be testing the post shave, which I'm starting to agree with others in that it's a moot point because who doesn't use some form of aftershave product? Anyway, for science and curiosity's sake Imma do it.",

I'll try any citrus scent. Off the puck, the soap didn't have much scent at all. Maybe it was always like this, maybe it's just an old puck of soap. As soon as I hit it with the damp brush, it came to life. The scent reminded me of 88 Chestnut or an Italian-type citrus. It was a nice combination of sharp green, bright orange, and sunshine yellow. I decided to pair it up with what's left of my sample of 88 Chestnut (courtesy of u/mammothben). I guess I'm just not ready to let go of summer yet.\n\nEDIT: I can't believe I forgot about Theme Thursday again...",

Then evaluate the brush handle ergonomics of this small Grizzly Bay one more time.\n\n#### ❧ Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Wolfman - WR2 SB .95 High Polish ::: PolSilver ‹17 uses›)*\n\nGenerally good feelings here, but sometimes a little roughness during the first pass. A fairly young blade by some standards, but I'll surely have to try a fresh one later. That may be the difference. The GSB I tried was twice as old, but much smoother.\n\n#### ❧ Soap Notes\n*^(WSP Rustic - Sandalwood)*\n\nScent: A nice, true woody sandalwood, without much getting in the way. I liked it.\n\nScent Strength: 5/10, nicely present during shaving.\n\nLather performance was excellent. You can push this guy and hydrate him all you want or back off with the water for some creamy luxurious lather. Provided very nice glide and protection.\n\nThis is a vegan base, and is a great one!\n\n+ 30 sec of loading with lightly wet brush\n+ 4 tsp water\n+ = 6 passes of lather.\n\nMaybe load for 25 next time.\n\n#### ❧ Brush Notes\n*^(TGN - Finest Grizzly Bay Red White Blue 24mm‹7 uses›)*\n\nI think this was my final try with this brush. I like the looks of the handle, but the ergonomics of it are just not comfortable for my beastly digits.\n\nI like the knot though, and may have to pick up a Golden Nib Finest on down the line.\n\n----\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: A little irritating\n*Neck*: A little irritating\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Cut flush to where I just see the tips (above average for me)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm) *and also in the sub's sidebar.*\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

It took me a while to smell the vanilla because of how sensitive my nose is to the peppermint. The lavender comes across as being a more herbacious lavender, than a soapy floral lavender, which might be a play of the underlying cedarwood.\n\nOnce lathered, the initial application causes me to think about Caron Pour Un Homme - the vanilla and lavender. The peppermint is there, but by this point, its in the background either due to fatigue or just because of the other notes. The sandalwood acts as a nice buffer for the vanilla, adding in a touch of creaminess while the cedar/amyris add a nice, perhaps a little spicy, woody backbone.\n\nIn terms of lather, slickness and post shave - this is a great soap and it's not too thirsty either. I seem to have noticed that I almost always get a better lather from my synthetics rather than badger/boar hair. I'm not really sure why and how to go about improving it. I do soak my brushes in warm water while I shower to soften them up, so that's not it.\n\nI have a small sample of SBS's Brain Break that I want to compare Elysium with.\n\nEDIT - forgot about themed Thursday - again!\n\nCheers!",

WTG, XTG, and another XTG clean up. Soap worked well. The scent changes a lot when lathered up as it reminded me a bit of musk. Brush was a experiment because I knew it would eat up lather. I tried anyways and I barely had enough for the 2.5 pass. It still felt soft and slightly scrubby; it is turning more floppy than I'd thought. Razor + blade felt good but the frequent shaving is giving me some in-grown hair. Mild post shave to wrap it all up.\n\nI picked out a nice sample! The smell really changed from a cologne-like scent to musky cabin-like scent. Great performance nonetheless. The Semogue 830 is a good brush but it does lack backbone and scrub. I find it similar to Semogue 1800 and the 3 banded boar brushes. Not my favorite but it works and I do enjoy the look. Can't wait for more shaves!",

We made it. Like in the rest of the world, for some in this sub this has been a tough week... but 👏 we 👏 made 👏 it 👏. Intel Founder & former CEO Andy Grove once said, \" celebrate for a nano-second.\" Perhaps he's right; reflecting on the week, and what's truly important, can make us thankful for what we do have.\n\nAlso, since I failed to bring you the daily dose of Stoic thought yesterday, here's my reading from Epictetus yesterday: \"the necessity of circumstances proves friends and detects enemies.\" What a great outlook. For those going through some shit, I hope you know you have friends here who care about you and are thinking of you.\n\nToday's reading from the Daily Stoic is **Life isn't a dance**: \"The art of living is more like wrestling than dancing, because an artful life requires being prepared to meet and withstand sudden and unexpected attacks.\" - Marcus Aurelius, *Meditations*, 7.61. Somewhat similar to Sam Elliott's words of wisdom from the Big Lebowski: \"sometimes you eat the bear, sometimes the bear eats you.\" The hard training and circumstances we go through make us tougher, and help us form an indomitable will to prevail.\n\nHope everyone has a great weekend.",

The Haverford smells exactly like my Grandfather's smoking stand. It instantly brought me back to being little and peeking inside when we visited to see what was hidden behind the door. It's a very calming scent for me.\n\nI paired it with 42 and it worked. The florals and tea were deepened by the tobacco and vanilla in the Haverford.\n\nOverall a good shave with no irritation, nicks, or weepers.\n\nHappy Friday!",

Otherwise, sunny, with a high near 76. Calm wind becoming west around 5 mph in the afternoon. High tide at 4:00 this afternoon.\n\nNice shave this morning. Soap is getting down there. I think I will see a clean tub by the end of the month. It was the last shave for this blade. Just wasn't cutting like it used to. Had to go back several times on the head to get it as smooth as I like it.\n\nHave a nice Friday everyone!",

Following it up with some Epsilon and Drakkar Noir and hoping that the big lemon note in the former will turn me slightly nose-blind to the lemon in the latter, because I prefer the scent balance a bit better that way.\n\nEdit: have spent some more time reflecting and sniffing Picture Day. There might be more nuance to it if I just test it with a hand lather and smell it at leisure over the course of an evening, but when shaving with it (and going nose-blind to it during the shave) I would simply describe it as a well balanced & smoooooth fern where no individual notes really poke their heads out and go \"look at me! it's all about meeeee!\" If anything, it's a little floral from the lavender and bergamot, but only barely. Very unlike the majority of \"barbershop\" soaps on the artisan market, considering that probably 60% of them are basil/bergamot/oakmoss/patchouli and another 30% are Acqua di Parma inspired. Not a lot of full-fledged aromatic fougères like this one get sold as barbershop in our world, which is funny because that's what almost all the \"barbershop\" perfumes are in the mainstream fragrance world.",

I'm in uncharted territory from here on out. It still does not seem to have smoothed out to my liking and with each use I'm itching to toss it out and use a fresh blade. I have a few more razors in my den so I'll rotate through those before I decide to toss in the towel.\n\nHappy Friday to all!!",

It has a great mixture of aggression and smoothness that I can get a very comfortable, near-BBS shave in two passes, and yet be perfectly comfortable to shave again after 24 hours. To me, that makes the perfect daily shaver and qualities I've only found in a couple of other razors. Either it's too mild and I have to buff like crazy or too aggressive and my face needs 36-48h for a comfortable shave again.\n\nAlso, Leviathan, wow, such good, such scent, wow. Coffee. Wow.\n\nWarm and slightly sweet, it paired perfectly with Hygge EdP (yo did you know Mammoth had EdPs on their site? Did you know they are awesome?)",

The lather was light, airy, and dry and I expected thish before the brush hit my face. Not because thats how PdP lathers, but because I am starting to come to the conclusion that all hard soaps need to be loaded with a brush that is drier than normal. As soon as I started loading I got that watery bubbly proto-lather that tells me I'm not going to be happy with the lather. I even loaded about twice as long as normal and it didn't seem to help. Adding my badger into the mix proably added to the issues 'cause I still haven't figured out badger brushes. One of these days I'm just going to have to sit down and use my badger non-stop until either I figure them out or give up. Maybe even use up some of my least favorite soap on some practice lathers.\n\nThe scent of No. 63 could be considered my dorway to the world of fragrances. It was the first scent I smelled that made me realize how great some scents could be. Everything up to then I pretty much described as smelling nice or good. When I need to class myself up without thinking about it this is my goto scent. The only thing I don't like is their post comes in balm only and I'm a splash guy. Weird twist of fate, as much as I love the smell of No. 63, PdPs other scent (Original?) is hands down my least favorite scent.\n\nFishing was wonderful yesterday. Weather was cool, first day under 90 in IDK how long, intermittant clouds and a nice breeze funneled by the trees. Plenty of wildlife, snakes (inc. my first Pygmy rattler), gators, turtles, and birds. The fishing was good if not great, landed two bass before the boat was even off the trailer, and most importantly there were no other people in our little slice of heaven. Stay smooth my friends.\n\nEDIT spelling and formatting",

Monarch was a sample given to me by u/Spankmeister88, this was my first time smelling this soap, and I like it....mostly. It took me the entire shave to figure out why it reminded me of smoking weed in high school. Was there something wrong with my nose? Does this *actually* smell like jazz cabbage? Does it smell like my high school locker? (I can firmly tell you that no, it does not smell like weed, nor the wretched stanky hellhole that was my locker.) Monarch smells like the incense I would buy from Spencer's at the mall to try and hide the smell from my parents. So, jury is still out on whether or not I'm going to buy a full tub of my teenage shame. Good shave though.",

It does. There is more than one way to skin a cat... or one's face! Wish the Timeless handle was a tad grippier though - if it gets soap on it, one needs to clean it immediately as traction slides away all too easily. Nice handle when not soapy though!\n\n**Lather:** Eufros tallow now seems to work noticeably better than Eufros vegan. Troubling that some scents are only available in vegan though!\n\n**Post**: As colder drier weather approaches, this may be one of my last chances to enjoy an alcohol based splash for the year. Frostbite is a favorite - awesome cooling, yet a well balanced botanical mix to soothe and moisturize to an extent. (Alcohol always dries, so any moisturizer present is working at cross purposes...)",

Barrister and Mann's Latha Sandalwood is a great soap, with a very interesting scent that includes black currant, sandalwood, and amber. The black currant note is strong off of the soap and stays that way through the lather, to the point of drowning out the sandalwood. I can barely recognize it, it is very faint, and I don't get any of the amber. That being said, I really enjoy this scent, but I wish I could find more of the sandalwood.",

I'm missing my Shavettes though.\n\n\n\nEast Egg was awesome yesterday and today I'm going with West Egg. I grabbed the EdP as I was running out the door and it leaked in my pocket so I'm smelling pretty strong right now. People are gonna think I'm boozing it up over here. I guess that's why beer breath is known as go home cologne.\n\n\n\nHappy Friday!",

I'm way overthinking mine but believe I've got it down - just going to be a next week deal but will be hardware and software and a THEME (betcha can't guess...)\n\nSo today was firsts both for WCS and bay rum as a scent. First bit that definitely put it in the winner pile was my better half was up early, came in the bathroom and went straight for the puck to sniff it. Very much approved. I enjoyed it as well and got a great shave out of it. Not sure what's going on but I'm a touch off my lather game lately. Probably the recent bout of lack of sleep. Still was a really good lather just took me more work than normal to build.\n\nThe Persona blade is still giving me really good shaves. I believe it has more blade feel than the Gillette 7 o'clock greens but that could just be in my head. Good thing I've got enough blades of each that I can swap around and test it out.\n\nShaping up to be a great Friday here - hope y'alls is the same.",

I always like to try new-to-me-things in the world of wetshaving whether I perceive that it might be bad or not. This is one of those times where the product matched my preconceived notions. This thing is bad. It is by far the floppiest brush I've ever used, like zero backbone. It is actually a mix of goat and horse hair (which I hate), but it was far softer and less pokey than the pure horse hair brush I had. Even given the floppiness of this thing, the new DG soap was super easy to get an excellent lather with. Just not nearly as enjoyable to use a brush with no backbone.\n\nAnother variable I changed was to a more aggressive razor, the Karve COC. I'm not usually a fan of open combs, but curiosity once again got the best of me. This one is smooth enough to (maybe) keep around. It's got much more blade feel than the SBD plate, but about the same level of efficiency. The soap performed admirably well in the protection department so I got a smooth shave with no irritation to speak of. Tomorrow I think I'll skip the aftershave routine and see how it does in the \"post shave feelz\" department.",

A great match. Another new-to-me soap, with the Klar Sport. and trying a longer soak on the Stirling Finest.\n\n#### ❧ Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Wolfman - WR2 SB .95 High Polish ::: Astra - Platinum ‹16 uses›)*\n\nDid so well. Comfortable, smooth and very efficient, giving a close shave. And even with a dozen or so uses on the blade already. A keeper combo for me!\n\n#### ❧ Soap Notes\n*^(Klar Seifen - Sport)*\n\nThem: \"sporty-fresh distinctive leather note\"\n\nScent: I didn't pick out the leather at first, because I didn't read that description before I shaved with it, and there were other scents parts that were interfering. I think I like it, though. There are some floral or powdery notes with the leather. Will use again and see.\n\nScent Strength: 4/10, lightly present during shaving.\n\nLather: Not buttery slick, because it's no tallow lather. But slick nonetheless, because glide and protection were excellent.\n\nLather started too thin, but went back to puck and got it to a good place.\n\n+ Minute or two of blooming/soaking because this IS a truly hard soap\n+ 40 sec of loading with my dense badger wasn't nearly enough. Maybe needs more soak time, or just keep loading longer. Had to go back to the puck a few times.\n\nYou get 3.9 oz in this narrow, but tallish tin (which is easily dented), and so I could see many people grating this into a wider container.\n\nI haven't used this brand much, but my boars seem to load enough soap in less time than my badgers.\n\n#### ❧ Brush Notes\n*^(Stirling - Finest in CravingShaving Blue Slate 26mm‹18 uses›)*\n\nStill a bit too much backbone, even after a 10-13 min pre-soak.\n\n----\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Cut flush to where I just see the tips (above average for me)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm) *and also in the sub's sidebar.*\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

Turns out we were a bit early (only about 2-3cm) and the contractions started to weaken so they sent us home to wait it out a bit longer. Was able to grab a couple hrs of sleep and we're still in a holding pattern, so I decided to do a quick clean up shave while we wait. I had always bowl-lathered with this cream but after experimenting w/ shave sticks recently I had the idea to try slathering it directly on my face and then face-lathering. I ended up a bit short on the lather, and was really stretching it for that 3rd pass. Not as much cushion as I remember getting from a bowl-lather either. But at least I feel like less of an armpit after being up all night and sleeping 2 hrs in my clothes.",

WTG, XTG, and another XTG clean up. Soap worked well just like any other Stirling products. The brush ate up lather as usual but Stirling pulled it through with the slickness. Razor + blade felt good; as the blade dulled, it feels milder and just right for me. Mild post shave to wrap it all up.\n\nSemogue 830 is feeling better. It is on the floppy side but it has just enough scrub for me. Any less scrub would be a sad day for me. Hopefully it maintains the scrub as it breaks in. Great sample and great shave overall. For future shaves, I'll be trying out the 'new' duro knot on my Dragon Fire handle and finishing up the soap sample. Perhaps the new SE hawk after this Schick injector.",

This is the first time using the Adagio sample and it's OK but very heavy in the cherry which just reminds me of children's sweets. It's Ok, not my favourite though.\n\nThe Cade balm as always is great, generally I find I prefer splashes but this balm every so often feels so good. It's just the right consistency and my face feels so good afterwards, it's just a shame it's so expensive (this was a Christmas present).\n\nOverall a great shave last night with a terrible nights sleep feeding the baby. Lots of coffee for me today.",

So my bottle of GLS toner clearly needs some more PTFE tape on the threads as it leaked a fair amount in transit. Fortunately it was in a ziploc bag so it didn't get everuwhere. It's a bummer though, as it's a waste and it's probably going to do the same thing on the return flight.\n\nSecondly the water here is so much better than at home for lathering. It's just night and day. It's a little depressing just how easy it is to do here by comparison. On the other hand, if I was actually bothered by it, I could always go the distilled water route at home.\n\nIt's nice weather today so I think we'll take our daughter to the zoo.

Ended up having a little more than I thought so I had a ton of lather to use up. Instead of my usual two pass shave, I did two passes, a touch up, and a practice grips and directions pass. Probably could have done two more.\n\nStill don't quite have a grasp of this brush yet. There is somthing odd about it, almost as if it's a synth acting like a badger. It seems to want a lot of water initially and doesn't have any desire to release the lather. If it is possible I would also swear that the stiffness of the brush has softened up.\n\nFirst time with Orbit and when I get my tub of NeV it may become my default pair up. I didn't get a good whiff of the scent - don't know if it's weak or I didn't use enough - but what I got was very pleasant. I've now used three aftershaves with synthetic menthol, Orbit, B&M's Terror, and SBS's Icy Stare. If I had to rank them :\n\n1. SBS's Icy Stare - It has the strongest and longest lasting cooling effect for me\n2. NO's Orbit - Technically Orbit and Terror tie but Orbit edges on scent\n3. B&M's Terror - See above. I also gave a little bit of this to my sister to try some synthetic menthol - she also likes menthol - but she said it had no cooling effect on her.\n\nFull disclosure: I've only used Terror and Orbit once.\n\nHave a great weekend everybody!",

The coolant is great for cutting through hot sticky days. I also like that the scent is heavier on this than most of my other N.O. offerings.\n\nOn a different note the razor bug has bitten me again. I like my rockwell 2-4 plates and am interested in a Charcoal Goods razor, what level should I try out? Thanks!",

This blade in it was a great combo for me. A wonderful head, for sure.\n\n#### ❧ Soap Notes\n*^(Pre de Provence - No. 63)*\n\nScent Strength: 5/10. Nicely available during the shave. Love the scent, too.\n\nWill continue to recommend this one to noobs and vets alike!\n\nLather: can be awesome creamy slickness, but this time I hydrated it too much. Was still slick and gave a great shave, but wasn't creamy.\n\n+ pre-soaked puck (about 2 mins)\n+ 45 sec load with lightly-wet dense badger\n+ 3 tsp water\n+ = 5 passes of lather\n\n\nBowl - I used the XL version of this 3D-printable bowl:\nhttps://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3392930\n\n#### ❧ Brush Notes\n*^(Declaration Grooming - B5 24mm Hammer & Chisel‹7 uses›)*\n\nOne of my favorites.

Later this morning I'll be heading over to Greensboro for a shave meetup, with cash burning a hole in my pocket. This is one fine day that's shaping up.\n\nDayuum! Will hit it out of the park with FA. I would buy the EDT or EDP in a heartbeat. I totally overloaded. I think the ripply surface of a new puck provides more surface area, and hence a quicker load. For a while I had stringy lather fibers that looked like cat whiskers all over. Adding more water was the answer, and I eventually got a fantastic lather going, and a fantastic shave.\n\nFirst time out for the RX since I got a Vector. I wondered how it would seem in contrast to the Vector. Not to worry, I loved it. I have the sad problem of having two great SE razors to chose between.",

Of course she demanded the YRP and then picked out The Kraken for my use today. I swear, I can't say enough positive things about this scent and I hate that I jumped on the Kraken express less than a month before MLS announced their closing. This is such a fresh and wonderfully blended scent that I can't pick out a single damn note and I'm perfectly ok with that. It just smells damn good and eases my soul in a way that no other scent ever has. It's just comforting and right. I dunno. Wonderful shave and great company in there. Definitely giving today two thumbs up!",

My lather this morning was fantastic and I had a great shave as far as one pass goes. Very comfortable, super slick, and smelling great. Love AYLM.",

I have all this soap in a bowl, and some on my face. It felt slick with my fingers? But so would Irish Spring if you lathered it with a brush. Whatever.

Homecoming is another lavender-centric offering from Summer Break. I need to use it a few more times before I can give the scent a fair assessment. For now I'll just say that it's good.\n\nThe Noble Otter smelled great on Thursday but the performance simply can't touch Summer Break, as far as I'm concerned. *(Edit: to be clear, I have a really hard time getting N.O. to give me a nice slick lather. It tends to be pretty draggy for me. I probably only have about a 25% slick-enough success rate with N.O. soaps.)* This stuff is really lovely and just knocks it out of the park for performance.",

At first I wasn't sure, as my face felt pretty dry immediately following the shave and not using any AS product. However, within 10-15 minutes the dryness is completely gone and my face feels supple and dare I say, moisturized. I am impressed, but for those of us who use aftershave products, it could be a moot point. I am one who believes that the less drying a soap is, the better post shave skin feeling you will have regardless of the aftershave used and this new soap excels in that regard.",

The weather guessers said today was going to be \"dreary\" and on the cooler side so I decided it was time to jump head-first into the fall scents. The Wolfman is probably the most efficient razor in my den and certainly the heaviest. I was nearly BBS on my cheeks after the first WTG pass.

My Angelique order was delayed and they tossed a free sample. Haven't seen any impressions so I will attempt. Notes: Notes: Rose, Geranium, Ashes, Nutmeg, Saffron, Sage, Oud, Labdanum, Oakmoss, Patchouli, Tobacco, Smooth Musk, and Violets. Off the sample container, I was a little overwhelmed with all the notes. It's a herbal smokey fall scent for sure. Once lathered, I definitely get the florals at the beginning. Then the smokey herbal stuff, oud, ashes, sage dominates for most of it. The hints of tobacco hits towards the end. It's a great scent that goes with the zombie theme. It's like a darker version of Noble Otter Lonestar. I feel this scent would fit within Southern Witchcrafts lineup for sure. Anyways that my attempt at first thoughts.",

That is the only bad thing to say about it though. The Luxury Base is absolutely amazing. This was, without a doubt the best lather I have ever seen.

Nice simple scent that is on the drier side of the spectrum. I find this scent to be very similar to the Uncle Jon's soap that I used earlier in the month. I don't think the WSP is as resinous, but the two are very close. While I'm not shaving with it, I also own the WSP Sandalwood in the Rustic base, and the scent on that soap is a little milder than the Formula T base.\n\nI'm happy to be home.

Sometimes I really wanna grab the SE and oil and get in what I'm best at, but it'll wait until I can get a few perfect shaves in a row.\n\nToday's SOTD\n\n* **Prep:** Cold water shower.\n* **Brush**: Claire\n* **Razor**: Merkur 34c (got a Progress on the way and I'm psyched)\n* **Blade**: Voskhod (6)\n* **Lather**: More Frankensoap (ArkoConk) It's really too good for the price.\n* **Post**: Alum, Cold Water, coconut oil.\n\nWoke up groggy, hopped in a cold shower and woke up quick fast! Really got the heart going early. I've given my no name brush a name; I'll call her Claire from now on. It was too sad to leave her nameless.\nVoskhod still going strong. Just as smooth as shave 4. I almost want it to give up so I can change blades. My Arko/Lime conk fusion is amazing, of course. This was my first all cold shave and the citrus really agreed with it. Super fresh. I also tried my hand at palm lathering... heh... I like it. Face lathering hasn't given me any grief, but this is easier on my face. Clair isn't the most gentle.\nI've taken to leaving the Alum in the freezer for my last two shaves and I'll definitely continue. It feels great! I can't wait to really mess myself up with some Cryogen and this routine. I'm a cold addict (absolutely hate to be hot) so I'm going to get samples of a bunch of Stirling Glacial stuff, NO Orbit, Terror outright before it's gone, Fine Snakebite, and Cryogen. I don't doubt I'll love them all.\n\nHave a great one everybody. I'm excited about the day ahead and it's thanks to a great shave.",

My nose started getting all jacked up and I think I might be coming down with something. The scent and performance were great but I wasn't able to fully appreciate it with a rapidly degrading sniffer. Fortunately, SBS has nicely sized samples so I've got plenty to explore. Hopefully whatever's wrong with my head passes quickly. Now to enjoy my day of rest where I work around the house all day to get ready for the week ahead.",

They give a much more mild shave than the other two, maybe throw them into the mix and see if I like them long term.\n\nShave today was pretty good, nothing really special just a solid shave with some good products.\n\nI'm trying to finish off some of these Zoologist samples, they are OK but I've not found many I'd like to buy a full bottle of.

I enjoyed seeing/smelling/handling all manner of products and gear. I came home with a quite nice haul, and great memories. I'll share various bits and pieces in upcoming SOTD posts.\n\nGoing into the meetup I had very little experience with Southern Witchcrafts' products. Basically one Maggard's sampler of Necromantic was it. At the meetup I got to smell much their soap lineup, and was immediately drawn to Pomona (Apple, honey, red wine, spice, honeysuckle). Love at first sniff, an no-brainer buy. But I then I totally screwed up by not getting the splash! That did not even hit me till I was well on my way home. Doh! Fortunately Maggard's is available to handle such unforced errors. First shave with Pomona went smoothly, though I don't think I quite got the water/soap ratio down. Even so, performance was great.\n\nI enjoyed talking with both Stephen (u/Phteven_j) and Courtney. The chat with Courtney was especially wide ranging, covering soap/scent making (of course), and sliding into cats and dogs, halloween decorations, classical guitar music, and Fiji mermaids. Between the excellent soap and the great people behind the soap, I think I may be an SW convert for life.\n\nYesterday was so much fun that the choice of today's tune was easy. Classical guitarist Julia Lang lets her hair down (so to speak) with a lovely arrangement of the Beatle's hit \"Yesterday\".",

She's a lavender soap, all right. Not quite a soliflore, but none of the other notes are so strong that they assert their independence. They just tweak and adjust and modify the lavender into something more nuanced than it could be on its own... which I believe was precisely the intent behind this soap.\n\nI won't lie. Mine smelled pretty gross in a brand new never-used tub - a little bit of tallow funk or something, perhaps. I honestly was avoiding it until I finally worked up the courage to try it yesterday. Frig, folks: this is a classic example of \"you need to lather this soap before you pass judgement on it.\"\n\nOnce I started lathering the stank quickly vanished and revealed a nice earthy lavender (likely enhanced by the cedar and vetiver?). As the shave progresses the neroli enhances the floral side of the lavender, but there's a hint of soapy green-ness in there too. I imagine that's the coriander (aka cilantro when it grows up into an herb)? It's very smooth and I like it *a lot* more than I expected based on /u/rocketk455 's marketing copy and the listed scent notes. I'm not a big fan of how spiky and herbaceous lavender can smell sometimes, and thankfully I find none of that trait in this soap.\n\nI haven't settled on a final score for performance because I haven't tried any SBS in the dead of winter yet, but this soap easily earns a SpongeScore of at least 8/10. Maybe a 9? We'll see once the weather drops down to \"kills underdressed humans\" temperatures.",

There was a package from Dogwood Handcrafts containing my Valley of Ashes hybrid for Austere August. Some pics of the brush [here](https://imgur.com/a/MgyAgcn). It's gorgeous work.\n\nI decided to take the new brush for a spin this morning with Barrister and Mann's Le Grand Chypre. The brush performed well and whipped up a great lather in no time. I love the way this soap smells. I'm going to have to add the matching frag to my wish list. Or maybe someone with more frag experience could suggest another chypre I could try.\n\nI finished up with a mixture of LGC splash and Zingariman unscented balm. Mixing aftershave splash with the Zingariman balm has pretty much become my go-to post-shave routine. Sometimes I switch it up and use my unscented Declaration liniment, but I know I can get more Zingariman balm if I run out and I don't know that about the liniment, so it makes using the Zingari an easier choice.\n\nToday's frag is a liberal application of Santa Maria Novella's Colonia Russa. It's a wonderful citrusy fragrance with a bit of lavender and rose floral. My only complaint is that it doesn't last all day. I need to decant some into a travel-size so I can refresh it later in the day if needed.",

Yesterday's lather improved on the lessons from day 1, and today I compared the new test base against Icarus: Tester in left side, and Sellout the right. This allowed for a direct comparison, and confirmed that the new base was easier/faster to dial in, lather was noticeably more dense (and took longer to dry out), more slickness during shave, and an improved post-shave that left my skin feeling great and moisturized. (This comparison speaks volumes to me, as I'm a big fan of Icarus and felt it was am improvement over the also-elite Bison base.) I felt like I could've gone without a moisturizer afterward, but went with my Zingariman test splash 5, which was equally matching in how great it absorbed and made my skin feel. What a great time to be a wet shaver!!\n\nToday's Daily Stoic reading is **No pain, no gain**: \"Difficulties show a persons character. So when a challenge confronts you, remember that God is matching you with a younger sparring partner, as would a physical trainer. Why? Becoming an Olympian takes sweat! I think no one has a better challenge than yours, if only you would use it like an athlete would that younger sparring partner.\" -Epictetus, *Discourses*, 1.24.1-2. I think of this as, in other words, \"don't wish it were easier; wish you were better.\" Great words I shared with my children (apropos given they're all athletes), and good words to remember today.",

WTG, XTG, and another XTG clean up. Soap worked well today. Especially with the synthetic brush, it gave plenty of slick and creamy lather to work with. The brush felt so much better with the duro knot, rather than the supervisor knot. Razor + blade felt relatively smooth and sharp. Mild post shave to wrap it up.\n\nThe brush felt great compared to the past couple brushes. The Semogue 830 feels great on the face but the performance can be finicky. One thing good about synthetics is that they perform high tier all the time. And I'm glad to switch out the knot because this Duro knot feels so soft on the face while giving a good amount of backbone and face feel. One of my favorite synthetics, if not already one. I'll be continuing with this brush and finishing up this Stirling sample in the next shave.",

Such a different lathering experience than Siliski. It seemed to come together faster and really wanted more water. Granted this is the second soap I have ever tried and still noob-styling at this, but what a different experience. As far as the scent, it was initially very sharp out of the sample container, but after lathering and application, the sharp initial burst dissipated and I didn't feel like I picked up much after that. Will be using this all week, so will update as things change. I like the Thayer's unscented more than the Nivea post shave balm I was using thus far.",

After months and months, I finished the Summer Break Soaps Bell Ringer. I don't know what tomorrow will bring, but I am just happy to reach the bottom of this. Bell Ringer is a great soap and Summer Break's base is pretty damn great. And obviously, despite being a relatively soft soap, it lasts a hell of a long time. I have two more tubs of Summer Break Soaps I will get to eventually (History 101 and Picture Day), but I may either work through some samples or try a few things I haven't tried in a while before resuming my killing expedition.",

It was nice to break it out again. Good lather and a good shave. The tea in 42 really hit the spot this morning. This is one of the few sets that I have hung on to for when the craving hits. I normally don't reach for floral scents, but 42 is right up my alley.\n\nHappy Monday!",

I used the same amount as usual and had a ridiculous amount of lather. I had to pull some off the brush to keep it from falling all over me. This base is great on all aspects. Great density, excellent residual, and amazing post shave. I can go without any post shave products if I cared to. (But I don't care to)\n\n\n\nI think Angelique and Gothique are both good pairings with Homecoming's darker take on lavender. Today I chose the light. Such a cool fragrance.\n\n\n\nFinally I have to say, Bruh. Weinstrasse is ridiculous. I'm not great at describing such complex fragrances. It seems like I can smell little hints from Shawn's other creations combined to make something new and different. My initial reaction is something like a creamy floral tobacco in Fougere form but that probably sounds silly to people that know what they're talking about. Mrs Cosmo says, wow, and so do I.",

But check out that razor. Got it as a prize at the Greensboro meetup. There were a bunch of sweet prizes (soaps, brushes, etc). I didn't count, but my guess is anywhere from a quarter to half the attendees walked out with a prize. This is due to the hard work and generosity of the organizers and vendors. To them I say thank you.\n\nI managed to score the Slim shown in the picture. There's a twist to that story, which I'll tell you tomorrow. The Slim has a date code of N, which corresponds to 1968. I'm no expert on vintage Gillettes, but to my eye it looks new. I did not previously own any kind of adjustable razor, so getting this Slim was an unexpected treat. I have no doubt that I will hang on to it for life, both as a working razor and a great keepsake. Today I had it on setting two, thinking I'll dial it up a bit tomorrow.\n\nTune: So far I've featured a bunch of guitar music, 'cause who doesn't love guitar music? But way down deep where the heart wants what it wants, Bach is what it's all about. This performance of Variation 14 is sublime, it blows my mind.",

THis was my first experience with both Uncle Jon's and a sandalwood soap. The lather was good if not spectacular but until proven otherwise I always blame my poor first-use lathers on me and not the soap. I did something I rarely do and used my DE for a nice leisurely 3 passs shave. Normaly if I break out the DE its for a quick and dirty shave. The lather was good enough that I didn't realize that I did my entire shave with my razor set at its most aggressive until halfway through my second pass. The scent off the sample was a dry woody smell of sandalwood (I assume, no previous sandalwood experience*) that almost made me think \"Hmm, I might not be a fan of sandalwood.\" After I lathered the scent mellowed into something enjoyable if weak. I really only got a whiff of the scent when my brush passed under my nose.\n\nWhat can I say about Grand Havana. Damn shame MLS is gone. With this scent they managed to create a tobacco scent that is tobacco forward without the strong cherry accompaniment that I find so off-putting. u/Hyasuomi79 is correct, this is a crimminaly underrated scent.\n\n*Technically the second soap I ever used was Proraso Red, [hated it.](https://giphy.com/gifs/angry-ZKLcZPHPEZnd6/fullscreen) This might be why it took me so long to look a sandalwood scent.",

I was in Chicago all weekend and it was just too much of a PITA to figure out shaving logistics.\n\nI went with the old school Brut fragrance mostly because I was worried that I was going to smell like my dad. And there's a reason I was concerned: he sent me the bottle of Brut. My dad isn't a wetshaver but my grandfather was an old school Italian Barber for 40 years so I think he takes pride in my interest in shaving. So after randomly asking him about Brut a few weeks ago a bottle showed up in my mailbox.\n\nBrut is a pungent juice. I didn't want to stink like an old man all day so I went with a night shave on purpose. It turns out that it feels great and doesn't stick to the skin so terribly that I'd feel self conscious. So all in all, my Brut experience was a win.",

I think it'll turn out to be a good week, but \"easy\" and \"good\" are not mutually inclusive terms. Life is good and it's good to work at it.\n\nAlright I was almost sad to retire the Persona at 6 shaves - it's still doing good work and it feels like it's got some life in it but I'm going to try to stick to the process of not going more than a week on a blade. They're so cheap and life is SO short that I don't get any real gratification from push the blades more than that.\n\nWinterfall was again awesome. Dan makes a great base and some really amazing scents.\n\nHope y'all had a good weekend. Take the time today to tackle something you've been putting off for too long. Shit ain't wine, it doesn't get better with age.",

I jumped off the deep end, used two of the worst soaps [back](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/9gihk4/monday_sotd_thread_sep_17_2018/e64mwel/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) to friggin [back](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/9hdgqj/theme_thursday_sotd_thread_sep_20_2018/e6bapwj/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) , and eventually burned myself out. Something about having a kid probably slowed me down too.\n\nI'm back, this is now a weekly series, and if you want me to try out your shitty soaps, I'm regretfully your guy. I shuffled the box a bit, grabbed the first thing I touched, and it was Proraso Green.\n\n*Objectively,* I know this isn't the worst soap, but *subjectively,* it's close. If for no other reason than Wicked Edge and some of you guys keep INSISTING it's better than it is. It's not. Stop buying it. Stop giving TJ Maxx so much goddamn free advertising. This is like, one single step above Barbasol with some water mixed in. That's it. The smell is chemical and medicinal, I very much dislike menthol soaps anyway, this wasn't a good time. I didn't shave yesterday so I could have a little bit more to judge this soap on, and I regret it. Somehow my face was slicker when I rinsed off the soap than when it was on my face. My face is dry and tight. If I have to use petroleum jelly as an aftershave, it's not a good soap.\n\nAll in all, I'm glad I'm only doing this once a week, cuz damn.",

      "body": "[Travel Shave in \"The Peg\"](https://i.imgur.com/tQ2x61j.jpg)\n\n**Prep:** Shower, California Sage Pre-Shave\n**Brush:** AP Shave Co. Tuxedo 24mm\n**Soap:** Chiseled Face Ghost Town Barber\n**Razor:** Karve w/ Open Comb D\n**Blade:** Personna Blue\n**Post:** Alum, Arko Nem\n\nThis was my annual travel shave in Winnipeg. I get so excited seeing how my kit performs on the road. Brought along the Karve (a Canadian razor!) with an open comb D plate and it delivered a fantastic shave. Been sportin' a stache and was able to get the outline just right sans shavette. As per custom I picked up this Personna Blue from Eddie's Sharpening. Check out my little write up on that [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/d87ado/eddies_sharpening_winnipeg_mb/). I actually found the crystal deodorant stick at Organic Planet Worker Co-Op in Wosely on my last journey to The Peg; best size, shape, container of any alum I've used. Homemade preshave oil is flavored with California sage I picked out in Big Sur. Interesting woody, herbal scent to that. Finished off this tube of Arko Nem I've had forever. I actually prefer it to Arko Classic; better consistency and scent. It will be replaced. The AP Shave Co. Tuxedo whipped up a fine later in a hotel room cup. The real star here was the Ghost Town Barber. Performance was excellent and the scent really evolved once it was lathered up. Off the tub it just smells clean and soapy but once lathered I get a lot more leather with a lovely barbershop. This was my first time using it and it was a pleasant surprise. Might see a set in my future... Happy Shaves ya'll!",

I love Noble Otter soaps, in general. This is a really nice scent. I have a terrible nose and none of the individual scents seemed to really be that obvious to me, but it sure is a pleasant and not overly strong scent. Maybe when I am not dying of seasonal allergies, I may try it again and see if I can actually tell what I am smelling, but right now, it was just a lightish, pleasant, woody scent. I like it a lot.\n\nAs an aside, I have been pushing it with blades recently. I have consistently changed after four or five shaves but I have started to let the number of uses creep up there. I am also a head shaver, so there is a lot of ground to cover with these shaves, but after eight, I still feel like the GSB has plenty of life left. I won't make it to 100 like some of you good folks, but I feel like I may get a dozen or more.",

WTG, XTG, and another XTG clean up. Soap worked well despite the small amount. I thought for sure that this was going to be the last shave with it but let's see next time. Brush felt plushy and soft on the face; medium backbone with a bit of scrub. Razor + blade felt mild but slightly tuggy on some areas. Still cutting well. Mild post shave to wrap it all up.\n\nGreat shave today. For the next shave, I'm considering a smaller synthetic as there is a minimal amount of the sample left. I want to continue using the razor + blade combo until it starts feeling rough. As the sample runs out, I'll be reaching out for more shave sticks and going down my rotation of soaps.\n\nAs for mail call, I got some PIFs on the way. One of them is melonade set and other is a mystery full of razors, blades, and soaps. Also, I had to get myself a TOBS grapefruit because of PaulH. This week is going to be a fun one full of mail call!",

I'm thinking my water is just too hard to provide the cushion no matter how much I add to my lather. A cream lathers much easier with much more satisfying results. It could be also due to the soap drying out a bit, there isn't much left, pretty much only a ring at the bottom of the tub.\n\nI guess it's creams and croaps for me.",

I read the description notes, and it sounded amazing. The performance was. Easy to dial in. Excellent cushion and slickness. The scent was a little underwhelming for me. Definitely on the lighter side to all the other NO soaps I have tried. Take this with a grain of salt, as I've said before, soap scents don't stay on my skin. The takeaway I got from the sample was that it's a very nice, light smelling soap. No notes really jump out at me and grab my attention. This would make a good pairing with almost any post shave scent as the fragrance was pretty much gone for me by the end of the shave. The texture of the sample was interesting as well. It was more...crumbly than other NO soaps I have used. Not sure if that means anything. As far as Dax goes, it smells just like the Burberry I remember, when I use to go out in Dallas and spend way too much money on overpriced Belvie tonics. Absolutely love the scent.",

I know nothing about the brush, it was on the pif table. The handle looked nice enough, figured I'd clean up the knot and see how it looked after a bath. I was surprised by the sheer amount of stuff on that pif table.\n\nThe soap and splash I purchased from Chris Cullen of Catie's bubbles. I love his cream base in Oriental, so I figured I could not go wrong with a blueberry topped fougere in the same or very similar base. The Slim I won in the (free) raffle, but Chris figured in that. He actually won the Slim in the raffle, but declined to accept it, and asked that they pull another raffle ticket and give it to that person, who turned out to be yours truly. So thanks, Chris.\n\nEnjoyed the soap and AS; CB is the real deal. Ran the slim on 4 for first pass, dropped to 2 after that, will fiddle some more. The brush seemed fine to me. I am no brush expert, and have no idea what it may have cost originally. It made an excellent lather and felt good on the face. Not scritchy, a tad less backbone than the Stirling that was until now my only badger.\n\nRe the tune: I first heard of these guys quite recently. Their style bit outside my usual tastes, but damn those boys can play.",

Henckels Friodur #472 13/16\n+ **Strop**: Tony Miller Fast Bridle\n+ **Soap**: Williams Mug Soap (modern formulation)\n+ **Brush**: Simpson 58\n+ **Post**: Speick splash\n\n\n\n\nThis morning has been great to me. My wife woke me up early, we used a discarded puck of Trumper's violet to lather in the shower (for all its faults, it DOES smell good), and my shave with the remnants of Willims went great. It really does seem that once you get the puck fully saturated, you can practically treat it like a normal hard-ish soap with the damp brush method. I even tried a stunt and shaved one cheek ATG with only residual slickness after rinsing, and I got no irritation. The Speick didn't sting but smells great. The whole day's looking good now, it's crazy what a good morning can do. To put the icing on the cake, one of my kids is sleeping in. Have a great Tuesday!",

Since I've officially hit the dregs of the shave soap and will need to start scooping bits and smooshing them in the bottom of my bowl to lather, I of course I had to bust out the new bath soap and take it for a ride. I've gotta day, Courtney outdid herself on this stuff and it smells, looks, and cleans beautifully! Most definitely worth the wait and it was the icing on the cake for today's shave. It'll be nice to have something to help ease myself away from the Nekromantik until I replace my set with a new one eventually.",

Clean but warm and sweet, it is kind of taking over the slot Stirling One occupied for me, sexy scent.\n\nBut todays shave was about rewarding myself with a 24kt Gold Medal. If anyone caught thr PiF thread I was lucky enough to win the other day they may know I have had a lifelong struggle with my weight. But in the last few years that struggle has been made more crucial. A series of accidents in the last few years caused severe damage and disfigurement to all 3 parts of my spine. There were weeks I could not get out of bad, days it hurt too much to make it to the kitchen to feed myself, times I could not walk or stand. Times of darkness.\n\nI have spent the last 4 years battling to get back to healthy. But TODAY marks 1 year since I made a full time commitment to my health. In the last year I have dedicated 8+ hours a day, 6 days a week to my rehabilitation. I have lost almost 80 lbs and gained a lot of mobility and freedom that has been missing from my life. I am hoping that with continued effort I will be out of the woods by this time next year",

I'm not going to go on about the performance (excellent) or the scent (also excellent) because that has been covered by others better equipped to describe them than me. I will say that even knowing the B&M's reserve base required a lot of water I was surprised by how much. I wasn't dipping the tips of my brush in the water, I was dipping the entire brush! I will add that as great as the scent off the soap is it really shines in the AS. I'm going to add my name to the list of people waiting for the EdP to be restocked and hoping that it wasn't a one time thing.",

The scent smacks you in the face. It's bright and bold. I don't know which note is doing the smacking but it's very similar to Phoenix and Beau Pall Mall.\n\nThis handle is supposed to glow in the dark but I have no idea how. Neither Hot water nor hot water does it. It's pretty but it would be nice if it did the schtick I bought it for. That's likely user error. TNS ghost knot is awesome. Definitely the scrubbiest and stiffest synthetic I've used.\n\nI haven't used a Voskhod blade in a while but I've bought way too many handles from TDR lately and he always throws a 5 pack in. Im hoping there gets smoother after the first shave because this was ruuuuffff. Lots of irritation. I pulled out some tried and true products in hopes that I can fix the damage done.",

They are not at all like their more common Extra stable mates save that they are pretty cheap (ten cents a blade on Amazon). They are quite a bit sharper (no birdshot neck for me from tugging, a problem seen with Extras) have a more consistent sharpness change from first to second shave, and last longer.\n\nSurprisingly, I got an easy BBS today with these mid sharpness blades and this mild shaver. Arguably, these worked better in the SS than Polisilvers or Astras. This is why DE shaving can be fun!\n\n**Lather**: An amazing smelling soap, the gentler, kinder Fougere Gothique. A smoky dark lime with other citrus notes to lighten things a bit.\n\n**Frag:** Finest classic warm weather EDT. It's time may be waning...",

Up to this point, Icarus is basically the gold standard in shaving soap in my opinion. As most who have used it already know it yields a dense, fatty lather with slickness for days. I believe the new base has all the performance of Icarus, but with a different style of lather. It's not as dense, but still super creamy with the addition of various milks and just edges out Icarus in the realm of slickness (like, how could it get any slicker?). The residual slickness is off the charts especially. I also feel that the post shave on the new base is slightly better for my skin. The other day when I went without any post shave treatment was proof positive of that. Tomorrow I'll do a bison base comparative shave and then finish out the week with the tester.",

I got a great shave out of it today but felt like it wasn't as efficient as the Gillettes which are my leading blades currently. Still a better shave than I'm used to out of them which confirms that I've either gotten better at my technique and/or the Tech is a better razor for me than the Fatboy & Slim I was using last go around with these blades.\n\nNot much to say - week is rough like I thought but it'll be alright.\n\nHappy Tuesday Y'all!",

Today's is to show how a mild razor can take out a 3 day beard with no problems. I also bring out my newest soap, Eau de Thé, which I got at the 2019 Carolina Wetshavers Meet-up in Greensboro this past weekend.\n\n#### ❧ Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Fatip - Piccolo Black & Gold ::: Gillette - Silver Blue ‹14 uses›)*\n\nTugged just a tiny bit, but almost not even worth mentioning, considering I was shaving off 3 days of growth. I just wanted to show how you don't have to buy an Open Comb razor for those thick multi-day growths... if you don't want to.\n\n#### ❧ Soap Notes\n*^(Catie's Bubbles - Eau de Thé)*\n\nThis soap is an exclusive given out to attendees of the 2019 Carolina Wet Shavers Meetup in Greensboro.\n\nThem: \"An energizing blend of bergamot, ginger, and green and black teas over a heart of aldehydes, orris root, green, grassy, aquatic and ozonic notes and a base of musk, woods and incense. It's fresh, it's (slightly) floral, it's everything I ever wanted in a hot weather fragrance\"\n\nScent:\n\nScent Strength: 6/10, nicely present during shaving.\n\nLather: A slick, creamy lather that I really enjoyed. Nice residual slickness for touch-ups. Easy to rinse off too.\n\n+ Brush soak of 10 mins\n+ 30 second load (and went back to puck during first pass) with lightly-wet soft badger brush\n+ 1.5 tsp water to build lather\n+ = 3 passes of lather.\n\n\nBowl - I used the XL version of this bowl:\nhttps://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3392930\n\n#### ❧ Brush Notes\n*^(Thater - 4125-4 Black‹1 uses›)*\n\nLoved this brush. Super soft, but enough backbone to hold the tips to the face, but it didn't feel floppy or that I was just rubbing the root ball around on me. Some may still consider it floppy, if they like really stiff brushes. Face feel was excellent. Unlike some of the different high density brushes out there. I think there was less drag on my beard with this \"standard\" density knot.\n\n----\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Just a little tugging\n*Neck*: Just a little tugging\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Cut flush to where I just see the tips (above average for me)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm) *and also in the sub's sidebar.*\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

For that reason, nothing should ever be unexpected by us. Our minds should be sent out in advance to all things and we shouldn't just consider the normal course of things, but what could actually happen. For is there anything in life that Fortune won't knock off it's high horse if it pleases her?\" I take this to mean, in other words, that planning for the unexpected helps us remove the sting of surprises.

Peeps, if you've got a bottle of Stirling Rose a/s sitting somewhere, I've got stuff to trade :)",

It is a super unique scent. The scent is definitely a bay rum, but it has a sweetness from the blackberry and vanilla. I am really enjoying getting whiffs of the splash. My wife didn't like the scent much off the tub, but she really enjoyed the dry down of the splash. Something in this scent is reminiscent to me of Bon Vivant.",

I know a lot of people enjoy badger brushes, but for me it doesn't hold enough lather and I really need to work hard to get enough on my legs for a shave. So maybe one day, if I get a >30mm badger brush... but for now, I'll stick to boars and synthetics. I have Maggard's 22mm synthetic brush in my travel kit, so I do know that even with a smaller brush, the synthetic knot seems to work better for me.\n\nThis is my second shave with the knot and I am really falling in love with this brush again. The handle is very comfortable to hold and of course, it glows-in-the-dark (I'm such a kid sometimes :P ). I used silicone to adhere the knot this time- I previously used marine-grade epoxy which was a @#$%\\^ to get out, and I'm always so conscious now when squeezing out lather and water, worried that I might accidentally yank the knot out... but no worries, I can always re-attach.\n\nToday was the third time that I used the Wholly Kaw soap sample that I picked up and I still can't figure it out. I think my water is too hard because it's fluffy when I first lather it up, but it goes flat quickly during my shave. At least it stays slick? I've tried not using pre-shave, less water, adding more water slowly, working the lather longer, loading more soap... it always seems great until part way through my first pass which makes it very challenging if I'm using a more aggressive razor (I purposely picked a mild razor for today's shave). At least I can say I really enjoyed the grapefruit scent.\n\nHappy Tuesday! :)",

While I had a handful of samples set aside for this month, I feared it would be too much hassle so I brought a bigger one with me. I don't know what I was thinking, I didn't need all this soap, the sample is so generous (0.5oz perhaps?) that it'll last 2 weeks at least. All it means is one less week of actually using up a sample. Scent is great though, my first time using a spice-bomb dupe.\n\nLife short, shave good",

Longest I've abstained since starting this mess. I really wanted to shave a few days ago, but decided to save up for when I finally received my new toy in the mail....\n\nI got lucky and scored a B2! It's basically a huge fluffy cloud. I expected gelly tips, but although I can see *some* hook action, the dried tips don't get crispy. It seems like a non-gelled yet uber soft knot like B5 but even softer. This might be due in part to the high loft that lets it splay freely. I included a side-by-side pic with a B8 (both 28mm) for comparison.\n\nReally happy to add this to my humble collection. I'm still undecided, but B5 may now have a contender for favorite batch. I kinda think B5 is the pinnacle of kickassery, but this one holds its own as well.",

Unsurprisingly distilled is much easier to work with. The big difference is it gives me much more flexibility and leeway in how much water I add to get the consistency I'm looking for. With tap water here I have to be very careful not to add too much water - which makes sense thinking about it, because adding more water ads more 'hardness', which is actively working against the lather. A successful first test then. I may have to look into citric acid as a softener if I decide to keep doing this long term...\n\nWhy Unconditional Surrender with Menage a Lavande? Because they are both purple scents to me.\n\n100 Polsilvers arrived yesterday. From Bulgaria, that's how you know they're the good stuff. Why do the Brexiteers want to deny me my customs-charge-free blades from Eastern Europe?\n\nHappy Hump Day all!",

Ah, Peter Wolf. He showed me an olive wood handle turned by his father-in-law, and the rest is history. Excellent price, btw. I felt like I stole it.\n\nWent with setting 5 on the Slim, and the L&L base delivered a wonderful lather.

I used the B7 knot all for 4 shaves straight while I was away on vacation. It's my favourite brush but I'm rethinking this after today's shave with the B8. This brush enjoys some overloading (relatively speaking) and what better soap than Stirling to serve this purpose. Once lathered up, this brush feels pillowy and luxurious. The more lather there is, the better. I didn't return to the tub to reload and had plenty of slick lather for three passes.\n\nKarve with the Voshkod blade works great - had a tiny nick but nothing of bother. Thayers and CL post-shave toner to close it out makes for a fantastic shave overall. CL aftershaves are just awesome. I really need to pick up some more stuff from them - Taum Sauk seems to be a popular one that I'd like to smell.\n\nWell hump day is here - have a great one folks!",

The samples bought directly from SBS are pretty generous and I've still got a couple shaves left on this one. The #6 plate is still a very good shave. I think I prefer the #5 the most but 6 would mow some growth down if I ever let it get to that point.\n\n\n\nI really enjoy the peppery kick to Lavande Poivere. It's one of my favorite go to fragrances. I'm dropping Mrs Cosmo off at the airport so she can go visit family for a few weeks. It's going to be an expensive trip I'm sure....",

Packaging is very nice with a large glass jar and clean and appealing artwork. The artwork being the primary reason I chose the Bay Rum scent, most of the rest of the line is some pictures of an Italian dude.\n\nWhile Bay Rum hasn't been my favorite scent in the past, this version was warm and mellow, quite nice, and no burning afterward. The soap itself is bright yellow, which was surprising. Primary and secondary slickness were very good, which I appreciate. So after one shave, I'm pretty pleased with this soap.",

Yesterday's shave was cleaner. Technique *felt* like it was the same, but that's always hard to say with certainty.\n\nSo why more stubble today? Is the blade fading in the mild razor? Does Tabac not \"elevate the follicles\" as well as B&M? (Which was yesterday's soap) Or was my technique off? Will wait until tomorrow's shave to see!\n\n**Lather**: Tabac lathered easily and certainly felt dense and slick on the face. I love the controversial scent here, though, strangely, it reminds me of my mom's hairspray from when I was a kid. Was she spraying Tabac brand hairspray? I kind of doubt that - so what hairspray stole Tabac's scent?\n\n**Frag**: Vetiver's floral tobacco note reminds me a little of Tabac, so not a bad match, but (not unexpectedly!) the vetiver in the eponymous Guerlain scent gives things a vegetative rather than a leathery finish,",

I'm glad I used this soap, it's been sporting the ring of death for quite some time, and it's been teasing me it seems. I'm ready to kill another soap, if for no other reason than to clear some reason for another tub. I've missed using straights, having been using the Wolfman the last week or so. My muscle memory is a little off too, I have a couple of spots where I scraped/nearly nicked myself.\n\n\n^^fuck ^^work",

While bison is a fantastic soap in all regards, I'm going to still give the edge to the new stuff. I mean, why bother making a new base if it's not going to be better right? Primary slickness is about neck and neck, but the residual of the new base surpasses bison. Something about it makes that slickness \"stick\" to the skin better allowing you to go over spots with no lather without worry of irritation or the razor dragging/skipping at all. The post shave moisturization level on the new base is also a lot better. The addition of milks does very well for my skin while the bison base leaves it feeling a bit drier without any aftershave (which never really happens unless I'm testing). Back to the new base for the rest of the week and then I'm on to killing some samples that have accumulated. Happy hump day shaves people!",

I revisited the infamous Blackbird, but this time seems like it was a v1, because the edges were bit harsher. I also tried a new soap, cause I'm a child of the 70s!!!\n\nI also am using an inexpensive, but very soft, badger from Virginia Cheng.\n\nAlso, my web site that does my formatting is all wonky right now. I'll have to troubleshoot. So we're raw-doggin it this time.\n\n\nRazor...\n\n\n\nFor the record, and after just one try with the v1, I did not notice any difference between the v1 and v2 Blackbirds. I could feel that the edges of the v1 had a little bit more of an edge on them, and I think the minor round-offs that he did for v2 make it feel like a more complete instrument. But in terms of any of those edges causing any kind of problems for me during the shave or while handling the razor... it just didn't happen at all.\n\nSoap...\n\nThem: \"The scent is herbs and citrus, incense, patchouli, leather, and whiskey! This soap is a limited edition collaboration between Dr. Jon's and Black Ship Grooming (formerly Beaver Woodwright)\"\n\nScent: i wish they would have backed off on the herbs on this scent. I think it is what was getting in the way of the other notes (that I love). This is one I'll have to try again before making a call on.\n\nScent Strength: 5/10, present during shaving.\n\n\n\n\n\nLather: this was a very wet lather. Worked well, and may be perfect for a straight shaver. But this razor has so much skin contact, that there was a bit of dragging. I didn't mind it, but some might. So should mix it a little thicker next time, if I use a Blackbird.\n\n* 45 second load with lightly-wet soft badger brush\n* 3.5 tsp water to build the lather\n* = 4 passes of lather.\n\nBowl - I used the XL version of this 3D-printable bowl:\nhttps://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3392930\n\nBrush...\n\nA great budget entry if you want a soft brush with medium-to-light backbone and average density. And to be honest, a great brush regardless of cost. Just glued it into this Craving Shaving handle and I really enjoyed it. Really did.",

I purchased a while ago second hand, but when I received it it was clearly unused. It's a different shape than has been used for years, and says'Best Badger'. Well upon research, I'm finding more information about these being rushed out to fill an order, that the actual hair is 'Super Badger'. The box still indicates 'Best', so I don't know.

I bought this direct, but there was an issue with shipping and my order never arrived. Luckily Tallow + Steel was super easy to work with. I let them know it hadn't arrived yet, and they got a second order out to me ASAP.\n\nYakushima is an amazing scent. I don't love every scent from T+S, but when they are on boy are they. It's definitely in the same vein as Kyoto, but it's more woodsy, less dirty.\n\nOn a separate note, I keep typing my SOTD into TTS and then forgetting to submit it. And suddenly it's 6 pm and no one will see my purty picture :(",

WTG, XTG, and another XTG clean up. Soap worked well again. I'm impressed with how little Stirling soap that I need to have plenty of lather. Brush felt great; soft on the tips and set a bit deep for a great backbone. This is my first Yaqi brush so it has some value in my den. Razor + blade was smooth and efficient. Rough on certain spots but overall, it was a sharp shave. Mild post shave to wrap it all up.\n\nI really enjoyed the shave today. I had an almost BBS shave but no irritation is more important for me. I did take an extra clean up pass but still no irritation. Going forward, I'll be visiting some soap sticks and varying my brushes. I'll probably give this Yaqi synth one more go and go back to some boars. I have a Zenith and a Omega R&B in the chopping block.",

Before Mickey Lee announced they were closing up shop. I might have put off on killing this soap if it was the only MLS in my den, and if the wife had liked it. The almost full tub of Paradise Frost and the fact that when I used Ruby's Green the wife would go out of her way to voice the displeasure. Had just enough soap to get a head and face shave in. There was a tiny amount left in the tub, but not nearly enough to consider getting a face shave, let alone another head shave. Performance was very nice. But they had fallen in terms of bases. With all the advancement in bases over the past few years, along with Sammy Lee being a one woman show and full-time mother, it was bound to happen. Was sad to see them go, but they had to do what was right for their family.\n\nHave a nice Thursday everyone!",

Who doesn't love a Spice-bomb dupe, really? My hotel mirror is doing a poor job fogging up and what-not after my shower. I heard that applying some lather to the mirror would help with that so I tried that a couple days ago. Took some leftover lather, slathered it, then wiped it off with a kleenex. I don't think I did it right because what I was left with today was a giant swirl of fog and streaks, kinda like a cinnamon roll. Oh well...\n\nLife is short, shave with good gear.",

The scent on this one is a sweet sandalwood that is similar to Proraso. There are a couple of other notes (coriander and star anise) mixed in that give this cream a little more depth to the sandalwood without overpowering it. It's a really nice, subtle sandalwood scent.",

I am about 95% certain that Kai has now replace Feather as my favorite blade. Good thing I don't use a DE too often because even in bulk you can't find them cheap.\n\nFor todays theme I used WSP Mahogany. I'll just quote a reply I made to u/verdadkc around the begining of the month where we were pretty much discussing todays theme:\n\n>Off the top of my head, without going back and looking at my den, Dr Jon's Anne Bonny, Black Ship Gromming's Davey Jones, Stirling' s Satsuma. CL's Uncondition Surrender was figurativly a lightswitch, didn't like it and was pretty much just using it because CL's AS is so good to my skin. Not a fan one day and the next day it was my favorite scent, currently only topped by CL's Admiral and A&E's Khalifa. The strangest experience with a scent has to be Wet Shaving Products' Mahogany. Ordered a sample of the soap and hated the smell the first time I opened the tin. Hated it the first time I lathered with it. Hated it 6 hrs later when I was still getting hints of it if I moved in the right direction (WTF?? From a SOAP??). Being a broke ckeap ass at the time I said \"Eff it I will get through this tin!\". By the time I finished it, disliked the smell from the tin, disliked the smell when I lathered. Enjoyed the small hits of scent I would get hours later. Ordered a sample of the AS from the website just to clear the free shipping hurdle. OMFG!! There is a sweetness (not sugar sweet but thats the only word that comes to mind) and depth to the AS that is missing from the soap. Like Khalifa it's as subtle as a brick to the face but if WSP announced they were closing tomorrow I'd order 2 bottles in a heartbeat. Still debating about ordering a couple of 10ml EdP samples in that scent.\n\nHave a great day everyone!\n\nEdit Spelling",

(In other words, I'll be using my Theme Thursday gear on Fougère Friday and vice versa.)\n\nThree fougères, all extremely green, somewhat soapy, and borderline harsh. I couldn't stand any of them at first. Fern, in the tub, was one of the grossest soaps I ever smelled. Mennen, dumped out of the bottle into my hand, was disgustingly green and powdery. Paco Rabanne, sprayed on a test blotter, was like bitter mosquito spray.\n\nLathered, Fern is very fresh and green, like mowing down an entire alley of flowering weeds. Verdant. Still a bit of a shocker to my nose, but no longer offensive. I won't be buying a tub but I'll finish off my sample some day, at least.\n\n*Applied in moderation to damp skin,* Skin bracer is *pleasantly* green, minty, and powdery. Refreshing even. Much more tolerable than when OD'ed. I actually sort of enjoy it now and I use it fairly frequently because the scent wears off quicker than my other splashes.\n\nPaco Rabanne, applied to skin instead of paper, starts out herbal and green and transforms into a smooth mossy fougère with hints of shaving cream. It has gradually become one of my favorite perfumes in my collection.\n\n*(Notice that I took care to make sure all my \"used to hate it\" scents were also fougères since I'll actually be using them on Friday.)*",

I'm a huge fan of my 46-47 Aristocrat so I've had my eyes on picking up a 48 for a while. I found a vague listing on eBay with only one unhelpful picture. I think the lack of pictures and specificity scared people away and price stayed low. I decided to take a chance and my god did I luck out. This thing was barely used. It still has most of the lacquer on it not to mention how deeply gold the plating is. It even came with a case that is in good condition as well.\n\nI was looking forward to this shave even more than usual. I'm trying to fight through these shaves with this Voskhod. Even so, the razor seemed to shave the same as my 46-47. I can't wait to try it out with a different blade.\n\nI now have a Gillette Diplomat on the way. My RAD is apparently renewed.",

Over time I have grown to like the scent. I don't mind the florals or lemon but I think what had me on the fence before was the sweetness. I used to get more hung up on soap and splash scents, which by all means is still a reason to love or hate a soap, but the scents themselves don't tend to last that long and I can always pair it with the matching frag if I really enjoy the scent or a different one if I don't. It's definitely a keeper for me.\n\nThere may be some life left in this blade after all. I dialed up the slim to an 8 and had a much better shave. The blade felt smoother. I'll reserve the 9 setting as a last ditch effort to keep this blade going.",

Damn, what an amazing scent and a full tub is in my future. Anyone know if/when Maggard will be restocking (gotta love that EDGE shipping)? Typical top-notch Southern Witchcrafts performance as well. All around excellent!\n\nThis was my third shave with the $1.00 Assured razor & blade combo that I'd mentioned last Friday, both here on r/Wetshaving and over on W_E. Honestly speaking, the shaves aren't terrible as one might expect. The shaves are just north of acceptable, but they certainly aren't the bloodbath of weepers and cuts that many seem to think they'd provide. Not my preferred choice of razor and blade, but a fun experiment none the less.\n\nForgot to mention that Samhain and Hallows pair amazingly!",

It wasn't the most comfortable shave so I'll be sticking to DEs and the occasional GEM shave from here on out. Finished off with Fougere Gothique aftershave and EdP.

I was sent 88 Chestnut Street by mistake and as an apology I was allowed to keep it (much appreciated). I definitely get the lemon notes (I do not like lemons) but it's not just straight lemon that hits you. It is wrapped in this heavenly package with other light scents that make up a complex citrusy aroma.

This is a budget blade, and was efficient at removing significant stubble on the first pass, to the rest were very comfortable.\n\nSoap...\n\nThem: Inspired by the much-loved scent of Imperial Leather, the floral and earthy notes of this composition evoke nostalgic, comforting memories for a soothing start to the day.\n\nScent Notes: Lavender , Bergamot , Lemon , Geranium , Fern , Cedar , Patchouli , Vanilla , Moss , Musk , Tonka Bean , Amber\n\nScent: What I get is the florals and citrus and maybe some musk. I got a sample of this from WCS a few months ago and the florals were unnoticed. I liked the sample pretty well. But now in the full tub that I got (used), the florals are much too dominant for my tastes. So the sample turns out to have lead me in the wrong direction. Oh well.\n\nLather: I love the lather from this soap base. Creamy and wet at the same time. Just perfect.\n\n+ 30 second load with lightly-wet dense badger brush\n+ 3.5 tsp water to build the lather\n+ = 5 passes of lather.\n\nBrush...\n\nI needed to soak this brush for longer. I think it was a 6-8 min soak, but the brush felt much nicer and splayed easier on the 3rd pass. So many of these Finest Badgers I'm finding that I need to soak longer to get the good feels, softness, and splay that I want.",

I went to town and loaded enough to make a voluminous lather. Three pass shave with a tiny scrape on my neck - this base doesn't perform very well for me - it's not as slick as some others I have.\n\nPost shave included Thayers, Seville reserve and finished off with a dab of Stirling balm. The Seville splash didn't seem to be very moisturizing hence the balm and it turned out fantastic. Maybe a balm needs to be a regular occurrence.\n\nSkin feels smooth right now. Great way to start off a Friday - have a great one folks!",

Twice now I've caught myself trying to twist the cap off, as if loosening the head of a three piece razor.\n\nRe the tune: After yesterday's tune I thought more Sara Bareilles was in order. Plus, my first SOTD show tune. In my book Sara's performance is right up there with Yvonne Elliman's.",

Leonhardy 22mm silvertip\n+ **Post**: Speick splash\n\n\n\n\nMy first shave with Théophile Berthon's triple-milled shaving soap, which I received in the mail from TSS yesterday along with a tin of Zartgefuehl Prinz Charming. My first impression is that the scent is great and it lathers quite easily, especially given how hard it is. Excellent slickness. Hard to speak of the density of the lather with any certainty as I probably under-loaded. The post was much better than expected - I was anticipating a relatively drying soap (like DR Harris), but this wasn't at all. I suspect the unsaponified shea butter in the formula (the 'karite' the label brags about) is the reason it wasn't drying.",

Five generous drops from the Frost Drops, plus the menthol already in Aqua Velva, did the trick. I'm really enjoying these frost drops and feel they are a steal for the price. Sure, I could buy menthol crystals myself and make my own solution, but these are way more convenient.\n\nGreat scent and lather from the Bufflehead. Only 30 seconds of loading and I had enough lather for 5 passes, which is a waste since I only did 3. Oh well, it's not like this isn't a readily available soap with a steady release schedule right?\n\nHappy Friday y'all. I'm going to a free outdoor concert tonight with a 11 month old and almost 4 year old. Pray for me. At least the music should be good; it's an 80's cover band that tours all over the Southeast. It'll be fun seeing people born in the 90's rocking out to music that came out the decade before they were born. Man, I'm getting old.",

I had been eyeing this set myself and was lucky to win it as I have been limited in my shaving purchasing lately. It normally takes me a few uses for scents to grow on me, a few times for my nose to decide if something is good or not. But not with Fougere Angelique from the first whiff off the tub I was delighted. It is a very well balanced scent, I get a lot of the lavender, citrus, and fir off the puck, with things getting a little earthier in the lather, and sweetening up a little in the splash. I wasn't entirely sure what to expect reading the scent description, sometimes a smokey note can distract me from the rest of a fragrance, but not here! The performance was top notch of course, I like the reserve base and splash..\nOverall this jumped into my top 5 scents pretty much immediately! I know Fougere Gothique is a little more controversial but I plan to give it a try very soon!",

Everything from building the lather to stropping the razor flowed effortlessly and without much thought. Tres Matres adds to my 99% success rate on blind buys. It is a pleasantly light and clean scent, not what I was expecting* but very enjoyable. The soap and AS smell a little ozone forward initially but once that dries down the floral and citrus shine through. The EdP lacks the initial ozone punch and some of the darker notes seem to have more of a say in the scent.\n\n*For some reason I expect all Southern Witchcrafts scents to make you think that you're in a hot, steamy, backwoods graveyard, it's three in the morning and dark, uspeakable acts of evil are being performed.",

My skin always feels smooth and supple (for lack of better word) after using a Reserve set. Lavender is still by far one of my top favorite single scents of all time, so anything that has a strong lavender presence is my kinda shit. I still really need to get a bottle of Lavande Poivre from CL, but the FITD made do today. It's a great take on lavender with a dark woody base. Seriously great all around shave today made better by the fact that it's Friday.",

Otherwise, sunny, with a high near 69. West wind around 5 mph becoming south in the afternoon. High tide at 10:44 tonight.\n\nFirst time trying MWF. Been wanting to try it for a while now, but didn't want to spend the $30+ for the ceramic dish. So I spent about $20, buying a refill puck and an empty container that Maggard's scoops samples out of. I got a tub of the TOBS Grapefruit that had enough cream for one shave left in it. So it was an easy way to try out the TOBS too. The refill puck fits nicely into the container.\n\nMWF is a nice soap. One that I will keep around. Currently have a stuffy nose so can't really tell if it has a smell, but performance is really great based on first use.\n\nHave a nice Friday everyone!",

For at least a few consecutive weeks, I have used super plush two bands. It happens every time that I pull a badger/boar mixed knot out - I am always pleasantly surprised by how quickly it loads and how well it releases soap. While not the sexiest in appearances, this brush is a rockstar. It was also nice to get just a touch of scritch after using cloud like badger brushes.\n\nIt's a shame that I didn't pay much attention to Mickey Lee soap until after they closed up shop. I think the scent of grand Havana is tops in the sweet tobacco category of those that I've tried so far. And really for a soap base that didn't get a lot of love, it protects very well and gave a really nice post shave. My only complaint was that in between passes my face was left pretty dry so I had to splash water on to rehydrate. The splash felt good, has just the right amount of sent it to it so as not to be overpowering, but I think I could've used a touch of menthol.\n\nI've been suffering through shaves with the same Voskhod blade so I thought I would give it one last try before I pitched it. To my surprise it was a really nice pairing with the iKon x3. I don't recall that it is particularly sharp but because the X.3 is such a mild razor I'm thinking that the blade pairs better with razors that are less aggressive.",

Yesterday's hotel shave featured my trusty old no-brand Mach III compatible razor because I didn't want to travel with a DE this time. The generic cartridges I have for it are... different. They're actually quite gentle and pleasant to use. I love the face-feel of this thing: zero irritation despite it dragging a million blades over your face. The downside is that the results somehow aren't BBS (more like an easy and consistent DFS) and it clogs like a MF if you have more than two days of stubble.\n\nFirst kick at the can for Fougère Angelique. Scent was exceptionally mild in the tub for a B&M soap - definitely the mildest I've experienced so far. Lathered up, it strikes me as one of those soaps that might change up a bit as I burrow down into the puck. My very very very first impression of it would be to describe it as \"fancy lime & supporting notes.\" I didn't pick up any hint of fern or fir or smoke or any of the things I expected during my shave, and I foolishly followed it up with a strongly scented AS splash that overrode any lingering scent. This is probably the first time I've ever thought to myself, \"I wish I had the matching aftershave so I could more fully experience this fragrance,\" but alas: I live in Ye Canadas and cannot order it, as it is an American Citizens Only Exclusive Product and I find that rather frustrating.",

My first time trying out this Karve open comb A plate. It was really nice and smooth, mild of course but still efficient. I'm just shaving my neck to let my beard grow for the fall and this A plate was the perfect choice as it didn't leave any irritation on my neck at all as some of the more aggressive razors seem to do. Dragonslayer and TTH paired together really well, I can see this being a combo I use often.",

Today's goal is to revisit an old soap and an old brush that I used a while back. The Sandalwood is their Formula T and I can compare it now to the Rustic. The brush is an FS Finest, that I put an o-ring on, and can compare to the Maseto and Stirling Finest that I've used lately. And I also wanted to try the WR2 95 with a brand new GSB, which I hadn't yet.\n\n#### ❧ Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Wolfman - WR2 SB .95 High Polish ::: Gillette - Silver Blue ‹1 uses›)*\n\nMy last shave with this head before it's traded away. I'll wait for the new one that is a smaller gap with way too much anticipation that should be due a shaving implement.\n\nThe GSB is so good for me in this razor. Breezed through the shave cutting nicely, and flew around as on ice, due to the slickness as well. A great match for me!\n\n#### ❧ Soap Notes\n*^(WSP Formula T - Sandalwood)*\n\nSandalwood is my favorite of the simple genres of scents.\n\nScent: A straight, though understated, Sandalwood, with maybe some normal wood in there too. But nothing else to mess up the scent. I sure liked it.\n\nWhile this SW is understated, the Rustic based one is not as much. More woodiness and depth of scent is available there. This is in line with what one of their folks told me once. The vegan (Rustic) base has stronger scents.\n\nScent Strength: 3-4/10, lightly present during shaving.\n\nLather: This Formula T base sometimes give me a lather that is really knocking on the door of the top-tier with its creaminess, slickness, and elasticity. Rinses were luxurious, and the lather was beautiful. Razor had plenty of glide and the shave was very close. I like the Rustic base okay, but this one is usually better, IMO.\n\n+ 30 second load with lightly-wet badger brush\n+ 4 tsp water\n+ = 6 passes of lather.\n\n\nThis formulation was very creamy and luxurious. I wouldn't go thicker. So between 3-4 tsp water is the zone for me on this one.\n\nWith 2 extra passes, I might load for a bit less time next chance I get.\n\nBowl - I used the XL version of this bowl:\nhttps://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3392930\n\n#### ❧ Brush Notes\n*^(Frank Shaving - Finest Badger - Extra Dense 24mm‹28 uses›)*\n\nI put an o-ring on it, because it was splaying too much, and I was just getting the feel of the root ball and less of the tips. This was better, but I think I'm going to want to go one more.\n\nI also soaked this brush for maybe 15 minutes prior to use, and that went well. I think I'll keep that up with my \"Finest\" knots.\n\n----\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Cut flush to where I just see the tips (above average for me)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm) *and also in the sub's sidebar.*\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

Derby Premium, thou are pronounced Anathema. (Or at least anathema in mild razor heads...) . Silversmith did far better with Astras ans Pols. Derby Premium is still much better than Extra, but this is faint praise. In a really aggressive razor like the Blackbird or CG L2, the Premium does well, but it was a lead balloon in the milder SS.\n\n**Brush:** Maggard badger has finally gotten over its lather hogging and now has decent flow through. Knot's sole remaining issue is Kentish hyper-bloom - feels like a 30mm now and applies lather in all the wrong places.\n\n**Lather**: The Ecstasy: A lovely green / fruity scent, a herbaceous gourmand that is like a desert oasis in scent form. The (very mild) Agony: Alas, like Figgy Pudding, this one stings a bit. My annoyingly delicate face has some issue with figs, or at least the B&M interpretation of said note. Not a major problem as long as I have the cojones to endure Slight Sting for Superlative Scent, and probably an issue that is fairly specific to me.\n\n**Frag**: Very amazing that this all natural scent is both affordable (relative to other all natural fragrances) and also projects and lasts so long. (Most all nats tend to be under-powered and brief.) A fine job from B&M and a great Fall scent!",

Today I used some gear that I rarely ever use in a further attempt to test this soap with as many different variables as possible. I'm not partial to boar brushes and this shave confirmed that. It made a really nice lather, but the face feel is just not as enjoyable as badger or even synthetic to me. The Standard I actually just sold but I thought I would give it one more go before cleaning it up and sending it out. I know a couple guys in IRC that really like this razor. It gives a good shave, but it's not for me. Maybe it's the light weight of the aluminum or maybe the fact that I didn't git gud with it. Oh well, I'm not a razor collector so if I don't like it, it goes. In conclusion, regardless of the other gear you choose, this soap can handle whatever you throw at it with ease. I think people are really gonna love this base as I can't really come up with one negative aspect of it's performance characteristics. All of that and it's one of the easiest, if not THE easiest, soaps to lather that I've ever used. Calling it now, mid to upper 90s $have$core. Happy Friday and have a good weekend everybody!",

I've never really hada a chance to shave with this and it is a beautiful scent for a cold, windy and grey fall day like today.\n\nThere's a lot of nice oudy/agarwood tops which is not super forward and balanced very nicely by the sweet and warm spices. I decided to pair this up with La Foret da Liguest which I enjoy very much for it's resinuous, balsamic, woody smell and Olympic Orchids Rainforest, which evokes the memory of walking through a lush, living forest filled with flowers, undergrowth, dampness right after rain.\n\nCheers!",

It's a quite nice scent, green with a little honey sweetness that could probably use a little woodiness to balance it more. The lather quality is merely decent, with good slickness and very little in the way of protection that I've become accustomed to from all of the artisans here. There is also little residual slickness. Ended up with some birdshot in a few places that would probably have been worse if this wasn't a newer blade, I'll need to do some more test lathering to get this into it's best form. This costs $9 in the shop that was linked in the PIF thread, I think that's a good price for what you get here.\n\nThe matching splash is actually a toner, with a witch hazel base instead of alcohol. The scent on this is more of dried tea leaves, with the woodiness that I was looking for in the soap present and the green notes dialed back a bit. I like this scent, it's enjoyable with only a little projection and I doubt it would interfere much with any fragrance you would choose to put on after. I definitely needed my Olay after it dried, there is little in the way of skin foods and/or moisturizers in this so if you have dry skin have a balm waiting in the on-deck circle. The bottle also doesn't have a flow inhibitor so when I went to pour it into my hand to splash on I accidentally poured about a tenth of the bottle out, which was mildly frustrating but something I should have noticed in the first place. This is listed at $16.50, I will probably pick up another bottle of this when I run out.\n\nThanks again u/MadDingersYo for this PIF!\n\nPleasant shaves, folks.",

I accidentally loaded light, so it was a 2.5 pass shave. Fenchurch seems like a fantastic leather and tobacco scent. The sweetness of vanilla and light floral and fruit notes pacify the leather, tobacco, and musk to make it a very pleasing scent. I wish I had the aftershave and EdT to try!\n\nProject Leather is a great scent as well, and it pairs pretty well. It also has leather, tobacco, and vanilla, but it goes a different direction with notes of oud and bourbon.\n\nI'm headed to a concert tonight, and I'm excited! It's been a couple of months since I've been to a show, and that is way too long. I'm seeing Rancid, Pennywise, the English Beat, and Iron Reagan. Gonna be a fun bunch of old punks.\n\nOn a separate note, I just bought a pair of raw denim jeans (my first other than Levi) that arrived today from Naked & Famous. I'm looking forward to seeing how my own sick fadez develop, and I hope they fit.",

Brush worked well but I needed to really work the soap applied on my stubbles. Razor + blade felt good but with the poor lather, I got couple of weepers. I'm trying to hold it on until the 10th shave and decide on the blade life. Mild post shave to wrap it up.\n\nMan, I was disappointed with the shave today. I was trying to record but the video would stop every 5min. The phone storage was fine but for some reason, the video kept cutting out. The lather was too dry and I got some weepers because of that. Now, I know to work in the soap thoroughly if I'm going to apply shave sticks to my stubbles. Anyhow, rest of the day was fine. I'll be repeating a similar shave for the next shave to regain my shaving composure.",

The Canadian Pre-War has slightly more blade exposure and feels slightly more aggressive and efficient than the EFBT. Still very smooth, and irritation free. A really nice shaver.\n\nIt's weird shaving with a SB again for the first time in quite a while - it takes a bit of getting used to the extra lather they remove on each stroke.\n\nP&B does not have the best base, but Imperial Rum is a well put together scent and it's my wife's favourite.\n\nHave a great weekend all!",

It might still live to see next year.\n\nShave today was great as always with these products and the Gilette Platinum is the best accidental buy I've made for a long time. It's gives a clean and smooth shave, I'll compare it with GSBs but it might become a daily go to blade.\n\nTrying out some more frag samples and picked one I knew wouldn't obviously clash with the soap & toner. El Cosmico is a bone dry wood blend that's meant to resemble the West Texas desert. I've never been to West Texas so cant comment, but this definitely smells woody and dry. It's not overpowering and there's very little to be offended by. From the first wear I'm considering picking up a whole bottle, we'll see how it performs over the rest of the day though.",

Lather was a typical Stirling though Bergemont and Lavender, while pleasant, is not one of my favorite Stirling scents. Post was typical A&E, skin is happy. Like Stirling's South Padre, St. Barts reminds me of my childhood at the beach. Have a great weekend everybody.",

The only meh element was the lather. Don't get me wrong it's good but I've been spoilt by some great soap recently.\n\nThe scent is like sticking your face into a packet of almonds, very one dimensional, natural scent. The lather is quite airy but an almond sized blob generates plenty of lather, it's slick enough but there are plenty of other options at a lower or equal cost that are superior.\n\nI own the shave stick of this as well and think it's alot better, the lather is heavier and slicker, although it's virtually scentless.\n\nI'll probably pass this onto my brother see what he thinks of it.",

I think I under-loaded it less this time, as the lather was a little denser. The scent remains fantastic. I gave myself a real cut for the first time in a while by mistakenly placing the razor on my lower lip proper, but thankfully it didn't bleed to the point of dripping and it closed up when I applied the aftershave. Oddly enough there was no pink lather because there was no lather on my lips themselves.",

Date code of O2 puts it in 1969. Judging by the beards that I've seen in pictures it's unlikely that this belonged to a future Woodstock goer but you never know! I love thinking about the history of these old razors.\n\nCompared to other Gillette adjustables that I have the weight balance is a little bit more too heavy. I got a great shave though but I did have to kick it up to a seven whereas with a fat boy or slim I'm usually on four or five.\n\nI really love the scent of gentleman's nod Ernest. Mango, citrus, tobacco are all scents that I like a lot. This is a great veg soap.\n\nFinally, the Maggard silvertip is impressive. Lathered like a dream, didn't hog lather, but still held enough for 3 passes. I liked the pairing of the bronze and black Elite Razor handle and the GN label.",

Might put some on when I go out to do my yardwork later...](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Brut-Parfums-Prestige/Brut-Special-Reserve-27243.html)\n\n**Thoughts:**\n\nDesairology: the mortuary practice of grooming the dead, aka SW's \"spooky barbershop\" scent. Definitely barbershop, but I don't think it smells spooky at all.\n\nMy usual spiel about barbershop classification: they're scents that remind us of barbershops, haircuts, and fresh shaves. They're usually a clean powdery thing (bergamot / basil / moss / patchouli), an Italian-style citrus + aromatics cologne type thing (e.g. AdP, 4711), or an aromatic fougère that evokes the scent of retro shaving products. (Sometimes they're a hybrid of the above, like Seville's Italian-cologne/clean-powder mix.)\n\nI put Desairology into the aromatic fougère category. Imagine that a talented perfumer took a sniff of Pinaud Clubman and said to themselves, \"ew - but what if... *not ew???*\" and took it in a slightly more creamy Brut direction, albeit without the massive Anise note. That's Desairology to my nose. Really lovely citrusy shaving cream scent. No hints of dead bodies at all. I had considered buying myself some WK Fougère Parfait but now I think I might get a full tub of this instead.\n\nIn summary, Highly recommended. Out of the 10 or 11 SW soaps I've sampled, Desairology shares the top step of the podium with Tres Matres. (No, I have not tried SamGamgee yet.)",

Oh my is this a nice scent. I commute through woods and farmland in a rural area and this is the fall scent! Overall it's a very relaxing, calming scent. Like stepping outside in the fall and breathing in the country air. Some fall scents are aggressive, cloying, gourmand, etc. This one is the opposite, I don't get tired of using it. Good job!\n\nPerformance: Lathers easy, above average slickness, superior post shave. I don't know if I own another soap with a better post shave feel. This formula is quite good.\n\nPackaging: No complaints from me. Water proof labels, wide tubs, extra grippy caps on the aftershave, all good.\n\nOverall: This soap was much better than I anticipated. I am a repeat customer which for me is not an easy thing to say (we all have pur favorites). If you have never tried this brand before please consider giving them a try.",

The lemonspice is a great scent like a warm lemon drop that does not taste artificial at all. Aided by the Grooming Dept. Pre shave, their base is slick as all get out through three passes. Like many T&S scents it does not linger as long as others but it is very refreshing during the shave. Got a little sloppy with the Ambassador but the A&E serum fixed that right up. Have a great day everyone!",

WTG, XTG, and another XTG clean up. Soap worked well today. I definitely worked in the soap and made for a great lather. Brush felt great but the short handle became slippery as the lather fell down. Razor + blade felt rough; more weepers and I knew that it was time for the blade to go. Mild post shave to wrap it up.\n\nToday's shave felt a lot better than yesterday's but the razor + blade still felt rough. I though the SE blades would have a lot longer life but it can't go over 10 for me without feeling rough. I'll probably stop the SE blades at 8 and replace them with a fresh one. SEs are a good changeup but not my favorite, I'd say. For tomorrow's shave, I'll go back to DE and shave on. Prefer a mild razor + blade... Maybe a Gillette Tech.",

Yesterday I had used DR Harris shave cream and quite frankly I was a little harsh on it, as Arko cool is literally a step up from canned goo. The scent is a fairly pleasant artificial Coolwater style cologne.\n\nIt doesn't need much water and lathered fine. The lather it's self seems slick but I certainly wouldn't buff with this as I would with a soap.\n\nI found it quite drying compared to the DR Harris too, the proraso balm I use usually solves this issue.\n\nI have used the Arko Cool cologne as well, it comes in what looks like Lynx/Axe shower gel bottle from the early 2000's. The stuff is quite potent, lacking any sort of complexity and is a straight aquatic cologne, lasting for at least 24 hours, I've had a shower before and it's still been there.",

For the forseable future I'm going to attempt to use up as many as I can. This may lead to some odd pairings of soap and AS since I dont have that many soap samples. I'm also going to focus on the two brushes I have that give me problems until I either figure them out or give up. Todays soap is a sample of WSPs Rustic Sandalwood that u/35048467 was kind enough to add when he sent me a sample of Uncle Jon's Sandalwood. First off I don't remember Rustic being this soft but it has been over a year since I used any. Lather was one of the better ones I have created with a badger, I think I'm starting to understand the phrase \"Load it like you hate it\". I must have loaded 2-3 times the amount I would use with a synthetic. I'm still not one hundred percent sold on sandalwood as a stand alone scent but I did like this one more than the Uncle Jon's. I am also not sure how to decribe it other than \"It smells like wood\".\n\nBarberry Coast aftershaves are the number one product that I hate to love. I love them for their post shave feel, to my skin they are as nice as CL or A&E. I hate them because with the exception of Bay Rum I can barely smell them and the bay rum lasts about ninety seconds. IDK if there is something in them that makes me nose blind but even cupping my hands to my nose imediately after applying I can hardly smell anything. They nust have some scent though as I have gotten into a car about 30 minutes after applying and been told that I smell nice. Hope eveybody is having a great weekend!\n\nEDIT ~~Sorry for the run on formatting. Looks like I'm going to have to figure out Try This Soaps formatting to get breaks where the need to be. Any help would be appreciated.~~ At the very least I have found a workaround.",

Henckels Friodur #472 13/16\n+ **Strop**: Tony Miller Fast Bridle\n+ **Soap**: Théophile Berthon Savon À Barbe\n+ **Brush**: Simpson 58\n+ **Post**: B&M Reserve Cool (sample)\n\n\n\n\nI've dialed in this triple-milled soap now, and got an excellent lather today. The brush may have helped, as the 58 generally tears into stuff, but I think more likely is that repeated use has softened up the top layer a smidge. My eldest joined me for the shave today, and he really liked the scent, though like me he can't pick out individual notes very well (in his defense, he is five).\n\nI grabbed some aftershave samples from Maggard the other day, and this was the first I got to use, largely because my aforementioned son insisted; I had originally planned on using the sample of Le Grande Chypre. The paper Reserve sample container was a little tricky to open (not sure if people have tricks other than \"do a better job tearing\"). The cooling effect was great once I got it on my face, though.",

He died of pancreatic cancer 2 years ago. I'm walking in a PanCan society fundraiser in his honor today. And shaving with his favorite aftershave and cologne.\n\nThe WCS Fougere was a gift with a purchase through the shave bazaar. I had been pairing my Paco Rabbane Sport with the Francisco soap from the Club, but it is a much cleaner scent then the Rabanne. The WCS is a better match, a little more bite, and a lot more herbaceousness to the scent. It really comes alive when lathered. And the fact that the Oleo Canard base is in my top 3 doesn't hurt anything either. The addition of the WCS Fougere to this combo is a huge improvement!\n\nThe Paco splash is just alcohol so I used some Stirling balm to help moisturize a bit. Following things up with the Paco Rabanne Sport, the scent is growing on me little by little. I only use it a few times a year. Its very strong with a lot of herbs, I think I get thyme the most. Much diritier than most Fougere scents I've tried. Makes Beaudelaire look sparklingly clean. It's almost spicy.\n\n[Shameless Plug for Pancreatic Cancer Action Society](https://secure.pancan.org/site/Donation2?df_id=2681&mfc_pref=T&2681.donation=form1)\nPancreatic cancer is incredibly lethal and an often overlooked form of cancer, it's not 'sexy' like breast cancer. More research is needed, and even a dollar is enough to help work towards more effective treatments and cures. Thanks for reading.",

But overall, it felt GOOD. I've gotta figure out some type of wrap-around shelf for the top of my bathroom after I finally paint the damn thing to display all the sets that I will have murdered so heinously. A trophy room dedicated to all my kills. I like that thought. Anyway, another great shave with a base that I'm still kinda surprised is vegan.

Well...there isn't one lol. It's been a grip since I've used Stirling and it did not disappoint. It's a damn good soap in my experience, but the bigger surprise of this shave was the brush. I've had this knot and old Stirling boar handle that have been waiting for each other for a long time. The handle was just waiting on a paint job. I had an idea to make it look like a wall covered in random graffiti and [this](http://imgur.com/a/GKkxrhH) is the result. That's not where I was surprised tho. It was this knot, it's so good! I was kind of expecting a total scritchfest, but no. It's plenty soft and has the perfect amount of backbone. One shave and I can already tell this is going to be a favorite. Happy Sunday shavers!",

So it is drier and not as sweet as Stirling, but not as dry and resinous as Uncle Jon's. Soap performance and post shave feel were excellent.",

I feel like Maggards is calling out to me, twice last week I almost made the hour and a half detour to go out there. The first time I was driving to Ohio, wanted to pick up a brush for a friend's starter kit and smell the seasonal stuff and actually took the route around Detroit to get there. Unfortunately the traffic was worse than expected and by the time I would have made it, it would have been closing in 10 minutes. Then on the way back to Michigan I got out of work early and almost went, but I thought it would be a pain trying to turn in my expense report and make an excuse to the auditor when explaining why I missed the turnpike exit by 30 miles. That and as much as I'd like to try Sanheim scent or whatever it's called, the last thing I need ATM is another awesome soap. Even my sample box needs thinning. Needless to say, I would like to make a trip there but I really should save my money...\n\nLife is short, shave with good gear.",

As per usual, I rinsed off the lat of the lather, patted dry, and left my face dry and untreated for a few minutes while I brushed my teeth. I didn't notice any drying sensation or tightness in my skin. I then applied some Cuir et Epices splash and a bit of Declaration unscented liniment.\n\nAll in all, it was a great shave.",

I found a few tubs of the Proraso Red at Marshall's yesterday for $5 a pop, so I decided to splurge. I've always had better luck with the red soap than the green for some reason. Excellent lather, glide, and cushion, though the glide might be cheating a little with the pre-shave cream.\n\nThe 7 o'clock blades are not my favorites, but I figured I would take another attempt to warm up to them. It's funny, I have set favorite blades I like to use a lot (Astra, GSB, Feather), but after about two or three months of daily shaving, I *need* to change blades to continue to see good results. And the Proraso cologne punches well above its weight; I have an order in for the matching shave cream and am interested to see how it matches up.",

WTG, XTG, and another XTG clean up. Soap worked well today. Pretty creamy and slick but it does have a dry post-shave feel. Brush felt good; I soaked only the tips and it had a bit more backbone than the usual floppy one. Razor + blade felt good but slightly rough on the neck. I did not know the blade was at its 11th use but considering that, it cut really well. Mild post shave to wrap it all up.\n\nGillette Tech felt mild but slightly rough on the neck. Apparently, last time I used this combo was in APR and this blade was in there the whole time. I'll probably use this setup one more time and toss the blade. I'll keep a similar setup but switch the soap to another shave stick.\n\nAs for mail call, I got couple more brushes incoming. A boss knot brush to fill in my synthetic wants and a custom brush handle that I wanted for couple months. It's in the Jefferson shape but I'll be putting in the knot later on. I'm thinking of getting the Maggard badger/boar mix knot in there and see how that feels on the face. Overall, exciting times to be wet shaving!",

I really enjoyed this brush at the time - good backbone and whipped up a lather no problem. The same is true for today's shave but boy did I notice the scritch in the hairs. I don't think I ever realized it was there before. The tips on this brush are very soft which makes for a nice spread of lather, it doesn't hog lather and generally is a great brush *for the money*.\n\nHave a great Sunday folks!",

The HeV Duc de Santal is a complex sandalwood that has a very nice scent to it. This is very much a cologne like scent that is similar to the DR Harris sandalwood. The sandalwood that comes across is not overly sweet or overly dry, it's right in the middle. This is one of my favorite sandalwood scents.",

It smells like the flower shop where I would get a single stargazer lily stem, back when I was wooing my girlfriend, and back before we had cats; the dumb bastards that will eat any plant regardless of toxicity. The soap off the sample puck was much softer than I expected. I think that attributed to me not pulling enough soap off the sample. I managed a great lather for about one pass with outstanding slickness. I wish I had an aftershave sample to appreciate a fuller expression of the scent.",

The sample of soap I used was one I ordered primarily to learn what frankincene and myrrh are. I've seen them in many scent discriptions but had no effin idea what they smelled like on their own. My first impression when I open the sample jar (couple of weeks ago when it came in) was it was softer than the Siliski I was used to, IDK if they changed formula or if it is the effect of adding scent to the unscented I had previously used. Still lathered great though. My initial scent impression was nope,nope,nope. But I have learned never to judge a soap on its initial smrll and I don't understand guys who bin or sell them after smelling them once. Soaps scents are so different once they have had time to breath and after they are lathered. I now know that frankincense and myrrh are woody scents and while initially I wasn't sure I would like this soap it is actually rather pleasant. I wish the scent was stronger off of this soap esp. as Siliski doesnt make aftershaves although they do make a body balm. I have a couple of their hand bars (also to primarily learn scents) and if I like them I may order some in this scent for my shower.\n\nPost was the same as yesterday, really wish I could smell this scent more.\n\nTodays frag is a sample that OK added to the samples I ordered and I'm glad they did. I had no idea what oud was and still couldn't pick it out of a pile of stuff on a table but I sure as hell like it. I really like all of OK fragrances, one simple note dominating with a subtle suporting cast. I just wish they lasted longer. If I had the money I would probably order them all.\n\nEdit spelling and formatting",

I opened up Seville since I haven't used it in a while and was greeted with a quarter-sized hole directly in the middle of the tub, with the sides sloping accordingly. Well, even though it seems like cheating with only that much left, it decided my next move right there. Seville, that spicy, citrusy delightful barbershop scent, is next on my kill list. By the time I finally finish it off, perhaps the weather will be more appropriate for Leviathan on the regular. In the meantime, I do believe that I'll be enjoying using Seville on the reg.",

He never used it and I decided I wanted it back so I could have all three colors in the Proraso set. I don't mind the scent now but I wouldn't describe it as, you know, great. It gets a SpongeScore of... 5/10? Maybe 6/10? Passable but not worth spending more than $5 on.\n\nHas anyone here ever noticed that Sandalwood oil is the *last* ingredient in the Red list, preceded by larger quantities each of assorted Parfum, citronellol, geraniol, limonene, linalool, and coumarin? I would be tempted to make an educated guess and say that *this soap may contain more fragrance than just natural sandalwood...* at least citrus, geranium, lavender, coumarin, and synthetic sandalwood to accompany the teensy bit of the real stuff that they include for truth in marketing, I would guess. Maybe *that's* the reason Proraso's so-called \"sandalwood\" scent smells so different from the other sandalwood soaps on the market: because it's secretly a sandalwood-heavy fougère instead of a single-note fragrance.\n\nMagical Perfumery Tour resumes today/tomorrow in a hodgepodge fashion: gonna spread things out a little further so it's not so monotonous. Today I am wearing ApH L'Eau. I will collect my thoughts throughout the day and post them tomorrow.",

After I had gotten used to the spicy top note, something in the scent reminded me of L'Occitane's (sadly discontinued) Cade Rich cream, but I don't know what it was; they're both from Provence, so perhaps there's some frag that's traditional in the region that they both draw something from. The consistency of the lather was similar to Cade Rich as well, now that I think of it.",

I remember the soap as not being particularly slick or dense first time I used it; just a very mediocre soap. I decided to load it a load heavier this time, and the lather it produced this time was outstanding! Very good performance out it this time. Some soaps just require longer loading time, and this is one of them. Menthol was not too low, not too overpowering, perfectly in the middle. Great shave.",

Fun times good stuff.\n\nTried out Chypre for the first time and really liked it. Icarus is an amazing base and so the shave was overall fantastic. I got this puck in a recent trade and think it's going to stay. I was thinking I'd like Shore more than this but the opposite is true. I may give shore a lather tomorrow and see but I just don't dig the scent. Might put it back on the bazaar too.\n\nAlright that PIF is HAPPENING. Got the photo I wanted and have the thing all written up. Shooting for today but might end up being tonight depending on how everything goes.\n\nHave a good day y'all.",

Kid woke up early, wife is bedridden sick, I was grumpy for no reason anyway,we got our first round of bills from our recent hospital stay, and I'm ready to fucking scream. I guess it's a good thing I didn't waste good soap on today's shave? I went back and forth between a weird sticky paste that I'm not sure ANYONE could shave with, to a frothy, foamy, runny mess with this cream. The smell was okay, if not a bit plain and fairly boring, but unfortunately it was also the best part of this product. The slickness was pretty on-par with water, and protection/cushion/whatever that metric is felt nonexistent. Honestly, I'd probably have been better off shaving with Cetaphil cleanser. At least I wouldn't have gunked up a brush using that. I want a restart for the day. I'm looking forward to waking up early tomorrow and using something fancy and nice smelling and not shit.\n\nEdit: wanted to finish this post while attending to my morning business in the bathroom, where I am now discovering there is no more toilet paper.

DE shaves are usually worse in one way or another; and thus, pardoxically, also more charming.\n\n**Lather**: The oddly packaged Yuletide serpent smells better than ever and has a perfect new home in Excelsior base. The label supposedly has visual elements representing all the scent notes, but I have only spotted coffee berries so far. The effect looks rather like a monstrous wreath though, which I am fine with.\n\n**Frag**: The original coffee / leather smell. More complex than Leviathan, lasts much longer, and costs much more.",

The knot it came with was pretty scritchy and prickly and not that great. Honestly, I bought it with the intent of replacing the knot as a fun little project, I just though I should try it once before drilling it out. It was pretty bad. Great handle, though. I like the length. Gives you really good purchase. Threads are clean. I wanted a solid travel brush anyway. Does it matter that the knot is worth more than double the original brush? No!\n\nI noticed that the new release of Fougère Gothique was in the reserve base, so I figured why bother getting a tub of the same thing. But I do appreciate having the splash though. I don't know if this is a difference between the soap and splash or old Fougère Gothique versus new Fougère Gothique, but the splash gives me whiffs of sweeter, sort of incense-y (frankincense?) aromatic notes that I don't get in the soap. That and the splash lasts for HOURS. I still get faint hints of it the day after. It's still on my hands. Not complaining, heh.",

This is my first time using Summer Break so I will expand a bit beyond a normal SOTD.\n\nScent:This scent is intoxicating. I'm a huge lavender fan and this is a darker take on it, one that is fantastic! There is just the right amount of vetiver in it to give it an earthy tone that is perfect for late summer. Love it!\n\nLather: Took me a minute to dial the water in. I would call this a medium-thirsty soap, so I used a little less water than normal and whipped it right up into a a thin yogurt like consistency that I like. I know some like the really heavy, Greek-style yogurt, and if that was my preference, it would have been no problem in achieving it.\n\nPost Shave Feel: Very nice My face felt great, even after 2 passes (that's all I ever do) and a little buffing at the end. All kinds of good stuff in this soap.\n\nOverall Impression:I loved it. I will definitely explore more offering from this fantastic vendor.\n\nHave a great day!!!",

Heard good things. Also a new-to-me soap, Guy Noir from CF. And I revisit a brush I haven't worked in a while.\n\n#### ❧ Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Schick - Krona - Metal Knob ::: Gillette - Silver Blue ‹3 uses›)*\n\nA little bit of blade chatter with this one. Not as bad as a vintage flare tip, but less, for sure, than a Tech or 40s style superspeed. So not super smooth, but comfortable and gave me a good cut. This razor feels good in the hand.\n\n#### ❧ Soap Notes\n*^(Chiseled Face - Guy Noir)*\n\nThem: \"one of my favorite memories is listening to prairie home companion and the adventures of Guy Noir. I have a feeling that this is the scent he would wear.\" Notes: Bergamot, Lemon, Orange, Cognac, Nutmeg, Tobacco Leaf, Woods\n\nScent: Mainly just tobacco to my nose. Maybe some cognac.\n\nScent Strength: 4/10, present during shaving.\n\nLather: This base I mix a little dryer that I might normally, and it gives me super slickness and great protection.\n\nVery good glide as usual.\n\nSpecs:\n\n* 20 second load with lightly-wet soft badger brush\n* 3-3.25 tsp water added to build the lather\n* = 5 passes\n\n\nBowl - I used the XL version of this 3D-printable bowl:\nhttps://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3392930\n\n#### ❧ Brush Notes\n*^(Frank Shaving - Silvertip 22mm Purple Handle‹8 uses›)*\n\nNot as soft and comfy as my Vig Shaving, Golden Nib, Thater, or Whipped Dog. But a serviceable brush that is still soft.\n\n----\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Cut flush to where I just see the tips (above average for me)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm) *and also in the sub's sidebar.*\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

As expected, the soap lathers easily and quickly with a slightly damp brush. The soap is hard and cracked a bit, exactly the type of soap people say *must* be bloomed to work. Nope, not so, my friends.\n\nThis is fantastic soap: really slick, excellent protection, very good post shave, and a lovely scent. Another soap I could easily and happily use for days and days, and I just have it sitting on a shelf. Painful.\n\nKyovu! I got some for an excellent price (in fact too good a price, so I made him take more $$$). What a delight, it's just as good as I remember, and the scent has grown on me. More later on this front, I just wanted to take it for a spin today, mostly to make sure it is still good (as in usable and not too old and \"expired\").",

I was going to shave with the Fine Marvel, since it had been gathering dust for a while. But apparently, last time I cleaned my razors, I put the head to the Razorock Slant on instead of the Marvel head. I didn't notice until I was shaving-because it was morning and that is really early-that I was using a completely different shave until I was rinsing off for a second pass. But it seemed to be working and I just decided to go forth and continue. In any case, I also broke out the L&L Grooming/Declaration Original soap because I found it while looking for a clean towel and it totally wasn't what I meant to use, but whatever. So, I have used this a lot but have never noticed such a strong pepper scent. The notes are Sandalwood and Bergamot, but I got at least 93% pepper this morning. So maybe I am hallucinating or maybe this has morphed into something else with all of this hiding behind the towels. But, I will say, it still performs like a dream. Great stuff.",

WTG, XTG, and another XTG clean up. Soap worked well today. A bit drying towards the end but it did the job. Brush felt floppy but it did its job. I'll definitely not soak it next time and put in under water, right before the shave. Razor + blade felt mild but slightly rough. No irritation but not the smoothest of shaves. Mild post shave to wrap it up.\n\nI repeated the same shave as yesterday and got a similar result. I'll be wrapping up this setup and moving onto a different one. I also got a cool mail call today; a PIF for a Melonade set. The soap smells less fruity than the aftershave but still very bright and nice. I'll be still waiting for the big mystery PIF and couple brushes on the way. Very exciting!\n\nAlso, I'll be off for a short vacation so no shaving for a while! I might be shaving in the hotel but won't be posting here for a bit. I'll see you guys next week!",
