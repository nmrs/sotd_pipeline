From the first time I used this blade, I knew something was off. I almost always use Perma Sharp, and for me they are incredibly smooth and generally wonderful. Being stubborn (and foolish), even though I could tell something was off, I decided to use it over and over again. Today was the third day on this blade, and it finally got me good. I have a cut all the way across my upper lip--probably the worst cut I've had wetshaving, including when I was just starting out. It's not very deep thankfully, but it bled like crazy. I had to hold a syptic pencil on it for a few minutes to stop the bleeding. After I finished my shave, this evil blade went straight into the trash. I'm a believer in bad blades now. Thankfully, it seems to be a very infrequent occurrence at least with this brand.\n\nThe new WK grapefruit is pretty nice. Nothing can overtake TOBS grapefruit in terms of scent, but it's a pleasing grapefruit scent. Scent strength is on the mild side. Performance is of course wonderful. Happy Tuesday everyone!",

For some reason, this cream is really hard and slow to load. Used it twice now and each time I had to go back and load more for the second pass. Good enough performance, mild scent on the cream - the cooling of the menthol and eucalyptus is what makes it great - and the aftershave is really nice. There's a good amount of smoke in the zcent and I'm not sure if that's what the SMN cologne smells like or not, but I think I'm going to have to pick up the real article at some point if it's similar to the aftershave. We finally made it to May so now ready for my wife to pop this baby out; her due date was Sunday so we're in standby mode.",

It was starting to break through the bottom so yesterday I grated it up and pressed back into the tub. At first I was immediately blown away by this scent, it's really good but just all the hype around it I wasn't quite sure what to expect. After sitting on it a bit I am super impressed and really love the scent. Closest similarity to me is Fougere Bouquet by Wholly Kaw (to which I still owe to Mr. Joyce). After seeing /u/nex_renegade review on the white base and his not so impressed remarks regarding post shave I was expecting to be let down, as it's been quite a long time since I've used that base. There's been quite a few bison tallows, duck fats, donkey milks, and reserves since then. I gotta say, the white base can still hold its own. Sure it's not quite in the same league as those others anymore and it's most definitely from a different era but it's still damn slick and the post isn't bad either. My face felt nice and soft after with no irritation. It is still far above anything that else isn't known as 1st tier today. I normally don't shave two days in a row but didn't have a problem with this stuff.",

Our son is two, and we think he understands the concept, but it's hard to say. He's been a little needier recently, so probably.\n\nThis soap is a great one to kick the month off with. I don't use it as much as I should, but its performance is truly top-notch. Not the post-shave quality of, say, Declaration or B&M, but it is nearly as slick. I'm trying to develop a tier ranking of the soaps I use most commonly, and I'd put Haslinger on the level of Stirling, Tabac, and Chiseled Face. I think my tier looks like this:\n\n* Tier 1a: Declaration\n* Tier 1b: B&M, Wholly Kaw\n* Tier 1c: Chiseled Face, Haslinger Schafmilch, Stirling, Tabac\n* Tier 2: Dr. Jon's, Reef Point, Supply Provision Co\n\n--- (Soaps above this line are great soaps)\n\n* Tier 3: Czech and Speake, Pre de Provence\n* Tier 4: Van Der Hagen\n* Tier 5: Proraso\n\n--- (Soaps above this line are good soaps)\n\n* Italian Barber, RazoRock\n* Godrej Cream\n* Old Spice Cream\n* Arko\n* Cremo\n* Melt-and-pour BS",

And this time the alum block said I didn't even have any real irritation anywhere. Wonder if it's coincidence that it's the third head shave in a row where I've reached for the AS\\-D2, which is a very forgiving razor.\n\nVery much looking forward to the 42 drop in a couple of hours. I've only been doing the artisan soap thing for a few months and Barrister and Mann has really been a huge driver of my explorations in that area. It's probably no coincidence that my journey into artisan soaps has coincided with my transition into management at work \\(and a shift in my daily apparel away from t\\-shirts with writing on them\\). My morning shave routine has become a real confidence booster. It's hard not to feel great when you walk out of the house smelling *this good*.\n\nSo, thanks to Will, the folks at Maggard's, and everyone on here and the Shave Bazaar for helping me take my shave game to the next level. Six months ago, I though Mitchell's Wool Fat was the height of luxury shaving \\(and really appreciated the very understated scent\\). Today, I stride out into the world smelling of lemon Pez, hyacinth, and \\(my favorite note in the accord for reasons of pure nostalgia\\) tomato leaf and I am the king of all I survey.\n\nUnfortunately, today I'm surveying a solid wall of meetings from 9\\-5. It's not a particularly awesome kingdom, but it's still good to be the king.",

It seems to tend towards the thicker side, which while not my preference, is very nice, like a cloud's wet dream.

Yesterday right before leaving work the phone rings, it's Mom \"Falcons1583 don't ask any questions but I've just been in a car accident and I'm trapped in the car, what do I say to the cops when they show up?\" Umm...talk about being caught off guard. So after I gather a few details it appears that Mom decided to turn left on red and was T-boned by another driver with the right of way. So, as much as she didn't want to hear it, she's 100% at fault. The trapped in the car part was due to the door being pinched shut.\n\nSeems as if Mom is okay probably just a tad sore today. She didn't like the part when I told her to expect some citations in the mail from the state police. She didn't seem to understand that turning left on red and causing an accident is most likely going to lead citations being mailed to the house.\n\nSo that's my story for the day. Let's hope that the new day brings no new excitement to my otherwise boring life. I like boring much better.\n",

First up is the limited edition Savonnerie Martin de Candre's Rose, which is a classy floral that wraps you in its aroma during the shave. Just an intoxicating and pleasant rose-forward shaving experience. I complimented the MdC with Chypre Rose Concerto AS from Wholly Kaw, which is a very close scent to my nose, but a little more complex. I topped the shave off with Frederic Malle's La Perfum de Therese, which offers a slightly different profile by including leather, spice, and aquatic notes to the dominant rose fixture in the accord. Have a great shave today!",

It's so purty but it definitely needs a new wig. Also got around to using Coastal for the first time. Again, this set suffers from the same faults that Stygian did for me. Scent is extremely light and just doesn't interest me enough to keep around, even though the performance is pretty good for the price.\n\n\n\nSo the \"Game Changer\" as its called has been pretty interesting for me since I got it. Its claim to fame is that it was [unanimously picked over its competition](https://i.imgur.com/Qr4HpwN.png). I'll be honest, that kicked up some red flags for me. I know some people can't find the angle on Wolfman Razors (not sure how) but you're going to tell me, not 1 person picked it? Anyways, onto my thoughts. Razor gap is mentioned to be 0.68mm. I can see that. Razor is said to be machine polished. Almost looks like a half assed polish job or a brushed finished in my eyes. Razor is definitely no where near as smooth as my Wolfman Razors have been (I've tried 0.67 & 0.74 blade gaps with SS, Brass & Aluminum). I was thinking this razor was going to be closer to that of the UAG that Wolfman offered but still, the *Game Changer* doesn't have that smoothness that Wolfman Razors do. I mean, was I expecting to receieve something that was of Wolfman quality for $50-60? No and Joe did a good job *marketing* his razor but still, its a $50-60 from Razorock. Would I choose a Wolfman Razor or a *Game Changer*? Do I even need to answer that question?",

I had an interview that I just finished. I think things went rather well. It's another part time job, for the same department that I'm currently working in, and it pays a lot more.\n\nAnyway on to the shave. The razor is mild, but very effecient. Much like the R plate, the M plate has no blade feel, but it did not cut me up like the R plate did. I'm starting to like this razor, but my only complaint is that it takes me longer to get BBS with the M plate. I wish there was a good in between for. The R and M.\n\nHave a great day guys!",

Some of the storms could produce small hail and gusty winds. Partly sunny, with a high near 78. Southwest wind 5 to 10 mph. New rainfall amounts between a tenth and quarter of an inch, except higher amounts possible in thunderstorms. High tide at 2:32 this afternoon.\n\nToday did not line up for Theme Thursday at all. My newb gear would have been a combo of my initial set up from Maggard's and some Van der Hagen: Simpson's S1; Maggard's V3; VdH Soap; Stetson Cooling Moisture aftershave. So taking into account that today was a head shave day and the fact that I had to get up at 3:30, I was NOT going to lather my head with a 19mm brush made out of porcupine quills. And the V3 would have torn up my scalp something fierce, which again I was/am not awake enough for right now. So I decided to forgo this week and use my normal set up, which was a very nice shave.\n\nHave a nice Thursday everyone!",

Mainly because it arrived at my house yesterday and I wanted to try it. Secondly, because a very well informed newb (not me) could buy stubble buster for $20ish shipped and have an amazing soap and aftershave. Obviously this isn't going to compete with the top notch soaps but for the price this soap is a bargain. If you don't have a soap and AS, I would recommend you find a scent and get it.",

I still love the scent of this and would love to find a worthy soap replacement. With this setup, shaving was something I did, but wasn't a particularly enjoyable experience. Now with good brushes, soaps, razors, aftershaves, shaving is something I really enjoy every morning.",

It's not really a surprise that I never enjoyed shaving enough to do it regularly. I bought the pre-shave oil a couple years ago on Amazon when I first \"got serious\" about shaving. Within months I had discovered Reddit and put it aside never to be used again. This is my first ever brush; I can't remember quite when I got it but I date it about 10-15 years old. I haven't used it since I discovered wet shaving artisans, and it was losing hairs left and right just from fluffing the hair and then a good bit more in the act of loading it. Does [this](https://i.imgur.com/tE9ArVq.jpg) look like it'd feel that great on your face? Spoiler Alert: it doesn't. Face lathered away anyway but this brush couldn't possibly be any more pathetic - I guesstimate the knot at probably 18-20mm and not even dense. Stirling probably doesn't belong in this whole setup, but you can't argue it's newbness, especially because of a certain newbcentric subreddit. For the razor, it's pretty much a [Viking](https://www.amazon.com/VIKINGS-Chieftain-Safety-Swedish-Platinum/dp/B011L8WJIA/) or something you could [find at Barnes & Noble](https://www.reddit.com/r/wicked_edge/comments/8gctgv/found_this_at_barnes_noble_today/). There you have it. My wife is due to be induced later this morning and I spent my last shave* before becoming a dad on this gear. Thank you very much r/wetshaving.\n\n*Actually nah, did just one pass last night and going to repeat [this shave](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/7idvj7/friday_sotd_thread_dec_08_2017/dqy5mdf/) before heading to the hospital.",

The CO Bigelow, as most of us know, is just rebranded Proraso green. I used to think the scent was pretty nice, but over time it really began to get old. I have a mild aversion to it now, I think, because it just smells so artificial. The slickness was actually decent, and I had a totally acceptable shave today. It's not a bad product at all--just much better stuff out there. The splash, on the other hand, is really terrific. I like the scent, and it makes my face feel good. I will always keep this splash around.\n\nHappy Thursday everyone!",

It's super floppy and not dense at all. The salesperson (who had a beard) also convinced me to get the soap called \"schaf\" which just left some bubbles on my face. I had a lot of bad shaves back then. My actual newb aftershave was pinaud lilac which smelled like baby powder and irritated my skin. It's amazing what you'll put up with when you don't know any better haha. TSM Fougere was my first artisan soap though so that's what I'm going to use.",

My first shave included a Slim, but I obviously had to sub in my Vikings Blade for this shave because what is more newb than one $40 for s $8 razor (unless you think the cool red and black stripes are worth it)? My sister got me this one for my birthday last year, I'm sad she overpayed, but I'm also glad she bought it for me because otherwise I probably would not have tried the Baili 191, which is one awesome razor for a low price tag. As for the Proraso White, I love this stuff, the performance may not be top tier, but its good enough and smells awesome. I'll always associate it's smell with the smell of wetshaving. I will always have the pre shave and soap in my den. I'm less of a fan of the aftershave, but it's still decent.",

I received this Declaration B5 the other day thanks to u/Nex_renegade and in the excitement jumped straight to shaving. Went with Adagio for the cherry limeade and menthol goodness since we finally had a nice day in the 80's.\n\nI needed to give this Declaration \"one-off\" a name. I really wanted one of these green and gold one-offs since it was the color of my favorite NFL team, the Packers. I decided to go with \"Greatness\" because that is what the G on the Packers helmets stand for and this brush and knot truly embody Greatness.",

Chalk it up to my penchant for excessive research when I stumble onto a new potential hobby. I tend to read and research in an effort to avoid the new-guy pitfalls. This has worked out with varying levels of success in the past. But I kind of jumped over some of the early mistakes in this game, because my \"newb\" stuff was an Edwin Jagger DE89, with B&M and CFG soaps. That DE89 is on loan to a buddy to try out wet shaving.\n\n[So I soldiered on with my usual kit](https://i.warosu.org/data/jp/img/0142/12/1444663157529.jpg) loving having a Lava in my life. Alchemist is a complex scent that I'm not in the mood for everyday. But on a rainy cold day today, it was perfect. Soap only though, I tend to find the AS a bit too much.\n\nHappy Thursday Ya'll.",

(1)\n**Lather:** [Proraso - Sandalwood - Cream](https://trythatsoap.com/collection/185/?product_type=cream)\n**Post Shave:** Nivea Cooling Balm\n\n\nMy contribution for today's theme. I bought this brush before reading the sidebar and was hoodwinked by the great reviews and awesome price on Amazon. When it came in, the tips were so sharp that I never thought to putting it on my face, until today... For soap I didn't have any TOBS or the like, but this is a brand that most muggles would be familiar with. I was fairly happy with the lather, I was surprised in that I thought I had left the brush too wet but after a bit of effort with the bowl it frothed up quite nice. Even only using painting strokes this brush was no good, the lather performance during the shave was okay but I couldn't buff any area without lather like I can with the slicker artisan soaps I have been using lately. For the razor I went back to my start (only a few months ago) with the MR V3, and I could tell that my technique has improved since the last time I used it, because I was very happy with the shave.",

Patchy fog before 9am. Otherwise, mostly cloudy, with a high near 68. Light and variable wind becoming southeast 5 to 10 mph in the morning. Chance of precipitation is 30%. New rainfall amounts of less than a tenth of an inch, except higher amounts possible in thunderstorms. High tide at 3:15 this afternoon.\n\nMan, the look I got from my wife last night could have killed. 3 packages of shave related gear. One of them contained this brush. I've been on the hunt for a Paladin Lotus for a bit now, and was giving preference to the Jade handles. On Sunday Paladin had a release at 2pm, which I was at work and unable to check. So I got home and meandered over to the site to find a several Lotus handles with one in Jade. I jumped on that so fast. Took it for a spin this morning. While the handle is bigger and fits my had a bit better than my Sumo, I still prefer the Sumo shape. The hair isn't as soft as the Sumo either, but I am going to give that a little bit of time to see how the tips come along. Over all I'll probably be keeping this one around.\n\nHave a nice Friday everyone!\n\nEdit: [To add pics](https://imgur.com/a/gFifB5V)",

The scent is a mix of floral, sweet lemon, and to my nose I smell some sort of spice in there somewhere. Though I could be way off on that. To me 42 smells like if Adumbrare and Le Grand Chypre had a baby. It's a very nice scent and I see why it's so popular. I love that lemon sugar note and it's for sure my favorite part of the scent. Overall I'm not a huge fan of florals so I won't be purchasing a full set of this but if florals are your thing this is a great scent. Props to both Maggards and B&M for always doing samples of the seasonal releases.\n\nThe lather was killer, usually sample lathers blow but pressed some soap from the container into a small glass Tupperware and loaded the holy hell out of it. Honestly was probably one of the best lathers I've had with the glissant base. This shit rocked. Super slick and yogurty goodness. The post shave was on point as well. After I sprayed the alcohol splash all over, my face was left feeling super duper soft.\n\nB5 Washington, I love you! I fucking love this thing. It's so soft and just feels so nice on my face. I can't get enough. It's the perfect size too, not too big not too small, juuust right. Exactly what my wife says to me about my hot dog.\n\nNow let's talk about the real star of the show - dat Karve razor. Someone on here recommended it to me after discussing the Rex razor and my love for mild razors. After seeing how reasonable these razors are priced for being fully machined I ordered one up with the shortest handle, AA, A, & B plate. It's the same idea as the Rockwell, but in my opinion much nicer. It's a brass razor and the color is beautiful. I really hope it doesn't patina because it just looks so good. For my first use I figured I'd try the AA plate. It fucking blew me away. It's so smooth, I seriously could hardly even tell there was a blade in there. Yet it was still cutting hairs somehow. By far the smoothest razor I've ever used. It's smoother than the R1 plate I used on my 6S, but cuts closer to an R2. I always got a patchy shave on the R1 which led to a ton of buffing. That was not the case with the AA plate on the Karve. For how mild it is it's surprisingly efficient. I can't wait to try out the other plates to see how smooth they are.\n\nDo you ever have one of those shaves where everything just fucking goes right? This was it. Definitely one of the best shaves I have had in a long time. Shout out to all my sponsors who helped make it happen, I couldn't have done it without you. Achieve, conceive, believe.\n\nHappy Friday fuckers! See you on the other side!\n",

It's a nice looking razor, and has a solid feel. I understand that the Game Changer was released (at least partly) in response to people who felt that the Mamba was too mild. I also have used a Mamba, so I can compare the two. I found the Game Changer to be surprisingly mild and not all that different from the Mamba. The Mamba had a weird angle for me, and this one is more standard. The aggressiveness feels like plate 2 on my Rockwell. That's an excellent thing for me, as I almost always use plate 2. But, for a razor that was touted as being more aggressive it was surprising. It was very easy to use, and really did remind me of my Rockwell in terms of how it shaved and the angle. It's quite nice, and I'm considering picking one up simply to have a SS razor that I could use. I was pleased overall, but if you're looking for an aggressive razor, this is not it.\n\nThe comparisons to Wolfman at least in terms of looks are quite frankly silly. The Wolfman is like a fine piece of jewelry with perfect finishing. This razor isn't nearly as shiny, and had visible machine marks in several places. That's not a terrible thing, but don't let marketing hype fool you. Of course, this razor is around $60, and the Wolfman pushes $300, so you get what you pay for I suppose.\n\nHappy Friday everyone!",

This will be 3 tubs killed in three months. I'm really trying to cut back on my stock pile of soaps. I really enjoy the scent on Khalifa, not so much the base. I heard that it will be updated to the new base soon maybe I'll try it again. Maybe not. There's just so many soaps out there. Another great night of hockey. Pens beat the Caps. Preds beat the Jets. Now tonight is the match up I'm really looking forward to Knights vs Sharks. It's going to be an awesome game! I'm a Bruins fan and they are playing the Bolts. They've been getting beat all over the ice so I'm interested to see if they come out swinging tonight.\n\nHappy Friday all!",

Like this morning, I suddenly caught a whiff of a bright citrus (I think bergamot?) that I've never smelled before in the soap. And I've been using this soap for so long I'm about to finish it. That's crazy to me. I've definitely been able to appreciate this soap's fragrance more since using it nonstop, which is consistent with past experience doing this. I have this weird theory that the more you consistently use a soap, you prevent a top layer, which keeps some of the scent trapped, from entirely forming, so you're able to better smell the actual fragrance.\n\nAlso, Jacinthe is incredible. Definitely did not expect to like it so much given the Pez comparison, but it's certainly one of my favorite scents to come out this year.",

A perfectly blended accord of Rose, Sandalwood and spices, the soap is a joy to work with since it's made with DG's base. Because of the prominence of the Rose, it seemed fair to include it in the floral category, but it could easily fall under a woodsy category, as well. The aftershave lasts most of the day, but the EdT is not outdone and both projects and lingers even more. An excellent selection for any fan of either Rose or Sandalwood. Have a great shave today!",

But most importantly, my skin hasn't been doing well lately. I've always had some form of eczema behind my ears, but lately it has spread to around my eyes as well. And while that doesn't necessarily affect my shaving area, my neck and cheeks have started to get really, really bad bumps. I almost always cut myself going over them. It sucks, but I just don't see any other way around it other than not shaving.",

This new to me soap (via /u/thecarbohydratedone thanks again) is my first time using the Reserve base not in sample form. I was very happy with the performance, it made for an effortless shave with a fresh blade. Although I don't think I had it dialed in fully as I squeezed out the lather for my last pass, that stuff was thicker and even slicker, so I look forward to whipping this one up again. I paired it with the most green AS I have and am pleased with the result. Have a great weekend, all!",

      "body": "144th Running of the Kentucky Derby SOTD\n\nSoap: WK YRP\n\nBrush: Declaration Vastness B4\n\nRazor: RR Game Changer\n\nBlade: Perma Sharp\n\nPost: SC Integrity Balm; AdP\n\nI've always wanted to go to the Kentucky Derby, and I was lucky enough to get tickets this year courtesy of my BIL. To my amazement, the tickets are not \"stand in a muddy field with 100,000 of your closest friends,\" tickets, but actual \"you have a real seat where you can see things\" tickets. So, the past few days, I've been scrambling to get things in order, and my wife has been getting her outfit and hat selected. The one element of my prep that I couldn't quite nail down was what to use for my SOTD, as I wanted to make it special.\n\nAt first, a classic scent seemed appropriate, but given how flashy most people dress for the event, something more ostentatious also felt right. I considered Boellis Panama 1924, and even a full AdP shave. WK LFP also would have been a nice choice as it feels very classic to me. Summer Break Soaps Field Day would have been a good contender with its grassy and dirt notes, but I didn't have that. Finally, /u/jmoney_84 gave me the winning suggestion: YRP. Since the Kentucky Derby is known as the \"Run for the Roses,\" with the winning horse being presented a garland of red roses, it was the obvious choice.\n\nSo, a long day ahead, but it should be a memorable one. If you're looking for me, I'll be standing next to my wife in the grandstand. She'll be wearing a hat, so we should be easy to spot. Happy Derby Day to all!\n",

I live in an older house and it was the original slate roof (circa 1930). I'll miss the uniqueness of having that slate roof, but I won't miss the financial pain in the ass that old roof had become in recent years.\n\nThe guys are finishing up today and it looks amazing!\n\nGreat shave today also.

He was kind enough to bless me with this pootery goodness so that I can make an informed decision regarding the purchase of this soap.\n\nTempest smells like a more metallic Petrichor to me, which I am not sure how I feel. I think the scent strength of this soap is perfect for this kind of scent - milder than this, one might not notice anything, stronger than this might be unpleasant.\n\nReserve Classic has been the scent that has really grown on me. When I first used it, I was simply waiting for the time to put it up on BST as it smelled like grumpy old guys to me. But over time, i have come to love the scent. My bottle is almost empty now, I should order another soon.",

I finally bit the bullet and went to a shop that has excellent Yelp reviews but was a little spendy. I haven't been happy with the cuts I was getting at the barber I've been going to so I thought it was time for a change. I'm glad I did. They were super professional, new what I was talking about even though I didn't, and they were playing metal on the sound system. So if you find yourself in the Riverside, California area I recommend checking out Riverside Shave Co. Like I said, the cut is a little much at $30 but you get what you pay for. Actually, I'm going to copy and paste this for a Yelp review. :D\n\nWhen I got back home, I knew two things; that I wanted to use Reserve Cool, and that I had an overwhelming desire to use the Tech. I popped the Gillette Platinum blade over from the Slim and I was off. I'm glad they didn't use anything other than a bit of pomade for my hair so I didn't have any conflicting smells.\n\nSo a great haircut and a great shave and it isn't even noon as of this writing. Now I'm off to run some errands. Have a great day!",

A sweet mixture of tobacco flower and caramel first hits you after opening the tin and continues into the lathering, which unveils the rest of the profile of mandarin, honey and rose on the backend. I'll continue to state C&F is too underrated as the lather is excellent and most of the scents in their arsenal are really exceptional to my nose. The balm is also very impressive. Absorbs fast and the scent lingers longer than other balms I've tried. Have a great shave today!",

Still digging on the APR base and scent.\n\nHave a nice Sunday everyone!",

I have wanted a travel soap, and Arko just isn't my favorite with its harsh scent. The La Toja smells better and was a good performer. I found it a bit harder to use than Arko, but I think it just needs more soap to generate the lather. Pretty good stuff!\n\nThe Game Changer is still very enjoyable to use. I am revising my opinion and think it's probably closer to a Rockwell 3 plate than a 2. The angle is very easy and it's smooth. I don't find it as efficient as my Rockwell but it's fine. It's a very good value at $55.",

A Midnight Dreary from Catie's Bubbles presents a \"dark and mysterious blend,\" or so it says on the label. It's inspired by or loosely based off Tom Ford's Black Orchid, but having smelled both, A Midnight Dreary is superior. Orchid, Lotus, Jasmine notes are mixed with a variety of others, including black current, spices, and dark chocolate. It's really an extraordinary mixture that's a favorite of mine. Paired with the matching toner to extend the experience. Have a great shave today!",

The previous two soaps on the block were really chosen based on how much of the soap was already gone. This time I decided to look around for something I really like, and something that fits the season. Really, I was interested in either breaking out some Declaration Bison Tallow or some WKDM, neither of which I've used for a long time now. After the Rain, Fern Concerto and Chypre Rose Concerto were top contenders, but I think they will all suit very well in the hottest summer months to come later in the year. After looking it over, my other top choice was this Mayflower, and being the month of May, it seemed like a perfect match, so it got the nod to go next.\n\nI've also spent plenty of time exploring blades in the standard NEW short comb, and with the the Franklin brush, so I decided to switch those up too. After literally months of using that big 30mm Franklin, this 27mm Hucklaration feels very small. I was also having issues transitioning to the thinner ball end handle on the RFB. The razor performed absolutely beautifully, but the thinner, lighter handle felt awkward in my hand. It will probably take a few days to get used to.\n\nNow it's time to go catch up on the mountain of chores that have piled up for the last couple of weeks, and maybe, if I'm lucky, sneak in an afternoon nap.\n\n\n\nHave a good one!",

Holy moly. I shouldn't have to comment on the handle, we know Phteven makes some philler phandles. But I will. It's awesome. The colors are so deep and complex, that this thing *will* need a name at one point. B5 feels very close to B2, albeit maybe a touch scrubbier. I'm not one of those people that likes lathering with a steel wool-like brush, so this is just perfect. Might need a round 2.....",

It goes okay with Manana de Lila, but not the best. I need a lilac aftershave that doesn't light up my skin like the Maggard's one did.\n\nHope everyone has a nice Monday!",

I am still really enjoying this soap, and I actually bought a back up tub last week. I think it's one of those soaps that I'd always like to have around because it's just so enjoyable to use both in terms of scent and performance.\n\nThe Game Changer is still giving me some great shaves--especially on my upper lip area, which can sometimes be problematic. It feels very solid, and I think the covered blade increases its stability, which adds to the smoothness.\n\nHappy Monday everyone!",

Hoooly shit, this might be my favorite brush. It's HUGE. The handle is a serious chunk of resin. Didn't take as long as I thought to get plenty of soap. It spreads the lather nicely, too, with the soft tips, but a lot of springy backbone. It leaves behind a thick layer. Really dense knot. It covers, like, half my face. It's amazing. $18?! Yes, please and thank you, Yaqi. This was a dreamy shave.",

This was one of the first artisanal soaps I picked up and I recall being pretty blown away by the scent profile at the time. And nothing has changed! An impressive mixture of floral and citrus notes (highlighted by three different blossom scents), Rhapsody is a brisk and sharp wake up for the senses. Paired with its matching aftershave, it's a real winner that will hopefully receive another day in the sun (plus an EdT!). Have a great shave today!",

Now to be fair i only started experimenting with other blades a couple months ago. Well today was a game changer, I couldn't believe what an amazing shave i got from the Voskhod on the first use. I would have to say the smoothest shave for me to date. Still have several others to sample but I think i found the one. Happy Monday!",

There were a few artisans there as well. They set up a table with some of the soaps and aftershaves they sell, and from the stuff I didn't have, Asian Plum stood out. I wanted to make sure I support Top of the Chain as he's a great guy and put together a great meetup, and wasn't going to leave without buying at least one thing.\n\nIn terms of performance, it's good. Maybe not WKDM or Declaration base, but it performs well. The scent is where it stands out. Love the scent, as does my girlfriend.\n\nFor anyone looking to buy stuff north of the ~~wall~~ border, you can't go wrong with Top of the Chain.",

High tide at 6:35 this morning.\n\nMeh shave today, but it's totally my fault for trying to go three passes when I know I can't go three passes.\n\nThis soap lathers great, and is an awesome budget soap. I just really couldn't make out the scent profile when lathered. While the aftershave was stronger with the scent it didn't stick around. But other than that I would definitely pick up another scent to see how that compares, but the wife would probably start flushing soaps and splashes.\n\nHave a nice Tuesday everyone!",

Wal Mart store brand Brazil :-/\n\nAfter my horrendous shave with the newly acquired Otto Roth and Lab Blue blade, I decided to go with a familiar razor and the more highly touted Med Prep.\n\nThe results were much better, and I can see what happened with the last shave. I just wasn't applying enough pressure.\n\nIt seems to me, Personna blades are just not very sharp. At least not as sharp as the Kai and Gillette Super Platinum that I'm used to. I can see why they're popular; they're very forgiving when you get a little Leroy Jenkins and start putting some elbow sauce on your technique.\n\nAnd they'd probably work well with a heavy razor, which I don't have, and all the positive reviewers did.\n\nBut I have relatively light razors and use a light touch, so I think I'm done with the Lab Blues and probably Personnas in general. I'll circle back around to them in a couple weeks just to be sure, but I'm pretty sure they're not my cup of tea.",

I put the SST head on the titanium handle to see how different the shave would be. It wasn't as different than I thought it might be. Obviously, the titanium handle took a lot of weight off the razor and it turned it to be head heavy. Not uncomfortable or anything, but I easily got through my first pass with no issues. To compare things, I then switched to the full SST set-up. It was actually a big difference in weight. Now, this was most likely because I started the shave with a \"different razor.\" I have to be a bit more diligent with the SST set-up (which is what I have to do anyhow). I then switched to the full Titanium set-up. It backed up my thoughts before doing this that the Titanium set-up requires less thought. Meaning, since it is so light-weight, you can really motor around without consequences, to a point. To summarize, the weight does make a considerable difference. Since the head involved in this little experiment was the 0.95 gap, it didn't change anything with my angle on all variations. Does the titanium handle and SST head make a difference compare to the full SST or Titanium? Yes. [Try it, you'll like it.](https://youtu.be/9qdfMYFl0Ic)\n\nThe Captain's Choice cream was terrific as always. Great Tuesday shaves to all.",

It won't take me long to use all 9 tubs of soap, so I figured why not. Lycanthropy is such a wonderful scent. Southern Witchcrafts scents always throw me for a loop, just when I think I have the scent nailed down, it transforms into something else.\n\nHappy Tuesday, fuck work.",

I have always used a brush, and was skeptical. Anyways, I followed the instructions and took 3 pumps of the shaving cream in my hand and started rubbing my hands together before massaging it into my face. It didn't create anything that looked like what I'm used to from loading a soap onto a brush and face lathering.\n\nI took out my razor and started to shave, surprisingly, the lather held up nicely and provided a nice glide and cushion for a nice irritation free shave. Performance was nice too.\n\nNow for the aftershave. I had no idea what to expect. Maol Grooming is new, they're located about 2 hours north of Toronto. I don't remember the notes, but the scent was predominantly lime, and had some menthol in it. Unfortunately their website is very minimal at the moment, but they only make aftershaves at the moment. The scent was nice and performance was good. It went on easily with no burn or irritation, didn't feel sticky, and my face feels great. I'll happily use both Elvado and Maol products again",

I love this B4 knot tho, super luxurious and massive. Very soft. B5 definitely has softer tips but I might prefer the larger B4 knot, though that may change on a day to day basis.\n\nReserve Fern just keeps climbing up the ranks for me. I love the scent and it's getting to the point where it may be tied at first with Seville for my favorite scent ever. Performance has already been raved about but if you haven't tried Reserve it's a definite must before you die.\n\nThe Feather paired very well with the AA plate. While it's not the closest shaving razor (especially in the denser areas like my chin) with this plate it's damn smooth and still does a really good job taking down hair given it's mildness. It definitely takes a minute to find the angle compared to the A & B plate but once you do it's smooth sailing.\n\nI have used AA, A, & B plates now at least once. I'm still not 100% sure which is my favorite as I've only done 1 shave with A & B plates, but right now if I had to give you an answer I would say the A plate is the best mixture of super mild and smooth while still giving a close shave. You can't go wrong with any of them but on first use I did feel like the B plate had more blade feel than I would like to use daily, where as the AA & A have virtually none.\n\nI'm going to keep rotating through them to get a better feel before I do a full on review.\n",

A little bit of super glue fixed it right up. Shave was good but I did get a few nicks. Going against the grain on my chin was difficult and left it a bit tender. Comparable shave to a GEM razor shave imo but I think I prefer the GEM. The little injector cartridge is pretty cool though. I'm probably going to do a more thorough review of the Martin de Candre Fougère but in short: performed well, weak scent strength, nice scent though. Paired nicely with Lucky Tiger Aspen. Happy shavin'!",

These mix with numerous other scents, that upon initial sniff give off a laundry detergent-type smell, which is disconcerting. Luckily, upon lathering, the profile opens up more and really blossoms (🤦♂️). Matched it with the mentholated and unscented Integrity balm from Soap Commander, as well as Slow Explosions EdP from Imaginary Authors to really let the Saffron and Rose shine.

The acoustics of this hall are amazing and the Dead did a 3 night run in late September. I will be featuring another selection from this amazing set of shows tomorrow. This show jumps right out the gate with an unbelievable [Morning Dew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morning_Dew) which kills from beginning to end. This version always gives me goose bumps hearing Jerry at his most mournful in this post-apocalyptic tale. It is unbelievable the passion that he is able to channel in a show opener. It soars from dark to light and leaves the listener in a very different state from having gone through the experience. A masterpiece. \"Walk me out in the mornin' dew my honey | Walk me out in the mornin' dew today\"\n\nExtra Credit: Same show, the [Playing in the Band](https://archive.org/details/gd72-09-27.sbd.vernon.18106.sbeok.shnf/gd72-09-27d2t01.shn) and the [Dark Star](https://archive.org/details/gd72-09-27.sbd.vernon.18106.sbeok.shnf/gd72-09-27d3t01.shn) are \"not to be missed\" verions of 2 epic songs. The Dark Star in particular takes the listener to places that they may never have been before.\n\nFor the shave, back on the every other shave with Summer Storm.\n\nPost shave, CL balm and then more some of my homemade Bay Rum.\n\nHave a great Tuesday!!",

That was a nice wake up call. After checking on the kids, I thought I'd get an early start since I was already up. I ended up pulling out my current favorite soap, A&E Grecian Horse. That thing whips up a lather with ease and I absolutely love the scent. I'm terrible at describing scents, but it's like a sweet fougere. Definitely recommend it.",

It still isn't the strongest scent out there, but I'd put it at a 5-6 (mid range). But it definitely is a nice spicy barbershop scent. My wife really enjoyed this one. Very nice thick lather.

The scent for Pure Lavender originated as a post-shave product, which was recently produced in soap form by Declaration Grooming. Created with floral lavender lovers in mind, the scent combines four different strains of lavender. While not intended to be a complex profile, it accomplishes its singular mission beautifully. The DG base is top-notch and makes the pairing with the matching aftershave a luxurious treat. Have a great shave today!",

I did a bowl lather today with this still too stiff for me boar and it came out well. I do really like the scent mix of this soap/balm, the hops and vanilla earthy tones make it for a different take on the leather idea that I enjoy. I am also looking forward to seeking out some trades for the lather games, so please look for my list coming soon to help a newb out.",

I had been soaking it here and there, and drying it off by brushing it on a towel/air drying. I know it'll need more time to fully break-in, but I really enjoyed the feel! The backbone is great. Much more than the synthetic I was using (which I still do enjoy).\n\nI just need to work on lathering and dialing the right amount of water. Sometimes I felt like the brush was absorbing lather... or I had too much water.\n\nEither way, it was a great shave. Nearly bbs on only two passes.",

I've been on a big lavender kick lately (especially for the times I shave at night) and truly regretted unloading this set. So naturally I was stoked when I saw this being offered again.\n\nThe soap has a great chill to it but without the menthol smell as they use something else to create the coldness. So the scent of the soap is a very straightforward and pure lavender (quite similar to Pure Lavender from Declaration/Chatillon Lux).\n\nThe soap lathers beautifully and the aftershave has a great post shave feel.\n\nI'm very happy that this set us found itself back in my den.",

It's spicy, boozy, and great for where I live. The Bay Rum scent lasts a fair amount of time. It's not a scent I would want to smell like all day, though, hence why I sprayed on some The One.\n\nI do feel a little dry though, so maybe it's not the most hydrating combo of them all.\n\nThis shave turned into an experiment halfway through. I was using the Shark blade and decided to compare it side by side with the Kai blade in the same razor on the same setting. I recently discovered that I love Kais, but Sharks have always been my favorite budget blade.\n\nThe Kai was noticeably smoother. I think I would still consider Sharks my budget blade of choice, but Kais have kind of crept up into my #1 spot for now.",

I don't usually get many compliments on my scent choices from my family but my mother recently told me that she really liked the way this soap smelled. So, I used it today in her honor. Today's shave of the day is dedicated to my mother.\n\nMy mother truly is the best person I know. She is unbelievably kind, patient, positive, and seems to have endless energy to get things done. She's not always had an easy go of things however. When I was 8 years old my father went back to school even though they had four kids. They were determined to try to find a way to support the family, so this meant my mother picking up as many odd jobs as she could to keep them out of debt. My mom worked at least two jobs that I can remember plus had two paper routes early in the morning while my dad was in school. They did this for numerous years, and even after my dad finish school she continue to work like this until he got a stable job. She's also had to deal with a lot of health problems recently, including two surgeries on her legs and a hip replacement a few months ago. Despite all of this she continues to remain upbeat and positive.\n\nMy mom would do anything for her children or anybody else for that matter. Now that all of her own children are out of the house most of the time she does have available is spent volunteering at various community organizations. In fact, this Saturday she's trying to convince me and my children to go volunteer at the local coalition for the homeless. She is the most selfless person I know.\n\n\"All that I am, or hope to be, I owe to my angel mother.\" Abraham Lincoln",

I caused her plenty of grief. As an adolescent, had I [awoken to find myself tied to the bed and my mother holding a sledgehammer and a block of wood](https://youtu.be/ueHC7pgfYGU) they couldn't have assembled a jury in my small town that would've have done anything but acquit her immediately, a textbook case of Justified Hobbling.\n\nAs a parent myself now, I appreciate even more her patience, grace, nurturing, and forgiveness. I'll catch myself remembering long ago cases of grief I caused her and just crumble with decades old shame and regret. I was a sweet if not smart-mouthed kid, an utter shithead of a teenager, and an irresponsible, aloof, and fly-by-the-seat-of-my-pants collegian, yet inexplicably she was always on my team. My sister was the easy one, but she showed us the same unconditional love. Again, as a parent, I am amazed. My children thankfully take after their mother, but still I want to pop their heads clean off every now and then, and I fear my kids also get that impression from me. Even in discipline, I got nothing but the impression that I was loved and this truly hurt her more than it hurt me.\n\nI hope I live long enough and her long-term memories fade enough where I am able to fill her mind-bucket with only new happy memories and/or gaslight her into thinking all those powwows with exasperated teachers/coaches/concerned fellow parents/law enforcement didn't actually happen. She's such a sweet, loving mother that I truly don't deserve.\n\nShe'll be at the house on Sunday, and I'll make her Eggs Benedict, and no one will probably notice except me, but I'm going to give her the smoothest egg, the most generous dab of hollandaise, and I will bring her plate first. I'll try again to tell her thanks for everything, but she'll wave me off, and act like she isn't the best, most patient, most graceful mother anywhere.\n\n\n\n",

Brain Break is her favorite (I called to double check), although she is also a fan of Teacher's Pet and Picture Day. It's been fun to have her smell my stuff because she is probably about my harshes critic. Usually she's critical in a constructive way although she did tell me an earlier version of one of my scents smelled like a urinal cake, which created more questions than answers.\n\nAnyway, thanks Mom for always being supportive of me. I most definitely would not be who I am without you.",

I knew the salve would perform well. I really like the scent, too! It's very orange-y, but I'm sure I'll get more from the scent as I'm familiar with it.\n\nThe razor is as idiot-proof as I've read. I got a very close shave and didn't have to think about angle at all. I want to see how this blade evolves and how my technique does, but at this point, it wasn't as smooth as a Polsilver or GSB in any of my DE razors (all Gillettes). It certainly piqued my interest though, although it's a shame that blades are so expensive compared to DE blades. If someone new to safety razors asked for a recommendation for a newbie, this would be mine, for sure.",

B+M Reserve Lavender works today as we drive back from vacation mainly because my wife and Mom are both wonderful women who can tolerate this scent.\n\nMy Mom's birthday was the 6th. She taught little kids from the day she graduated from college to the day she retired. Everyone knew/ knows her, not simply because she is an awesome, kind and loving soul but also because she is so damn obsessed with the color purple. She had many nicknames based on purple and ofcourse lavender is in the purple family of colors lol.\n\n\nMy wife's birthday is tomorrow and this is one of the few scents I have she can tolerate more than 10 minutes without her olfactory going into hyperdrive to deep space nine. Still she takes care of our busy 2yr old full time and is still an amazing selfless and loving person. My life would he a hot disaster without her.\n\n\nOtherwise the blade is the ish and the razor is tolerable. Happy shaving! Toodles",

The only plants that ever produced much of anything were the tomatoes.\n\nI suppose the brush fits the theme as well because I'll be taking it on the big family trip (my family if four + my sister's family of four + my parents) in July.\n\nThe house is actually starting to look like we're moving out, which is progress since movers are showing up Saturday to load our stuff. I'm debating whether I can reasonably do the Lather Games since we'll be living in our between-houses apartment the whole month and leaving for the family trip at the tail end (meaning I'd have to take multiple soaps along to finish out). Maybe I'll just join in on the days I can and leave the prize chase to the pro shavers.",

I spent the entire day fixing up the house to get ready for baby #3, but for some reason I'm still up. What better way to settle down than to have a nice and relaxing shave with my newest acquisition: B&M Reserve \\- Lavender. This is my first tub of B&M soap ever and I can already see why many people love this brand. This thing whipped up a great lather with ease. Even after just one shave, I can already rank this soap in my top 2. Anyway, here's to hoping the lavender helps me catch a few Z's before the morning chaos. Hope everyone has a wonderful Friday!",

West wind 10 to 15 mph, with gusts as high as 25 mph. High tide at 9:08 tonight.\n\nHead shave day. Decided to take a break from killing the Manana de Lila after using it two days in a row. And after reading /u/Hyvasuomi79 comments on DD's soap I wanted to go back to see, in my opinion, what held up. I agree with the packaging: using this brush, albeit a massive specimen, it was a bit of a struggle even getting it into the container, and then getting it moving around to load it. Also because of head shave day I load for about a minute, about halfway through the load there was quite a sizable amount of proto-lather on the handle itself, something I don't get using lower profile/wider mouth jars. The slickness and and post-shave do seem fine to me, but they aren't quite Tier 1 more like Tier 1.5. But I am willing to overlook that because Scale Polish is that great.\n\nAs for the labeling I am a fan of it. It's a little bit whimsical. The labels on the side of the tubs help where I have my soaps, so I don't have to go through a pile of soap to find what I'm looking for, and the same goes for the Scale Polish, the labels on the side are great.\n\nHave the day off, which I get to spend running around doing errands and packing. For the first time since The Small One was born the wife and I are getting a weekend away. The In-laws are getting The Small One off the bus and are watching her for the weekend while the Wife and I go down to spend the weekend in Portsmouth to celebrate our wedding anniversary on Saturday. Should be a fun time for everyone involved.\n\nHave a nice Friday everyone!",

The new LASSCO is a great improvement over the old base, and the scent on Black Fern is terrific. I had a wonderful shave this morning, and the woody note of the MLSW CdA was a perfect compliment.

Once home, I put it aside and used other things. Then yesterday I received my eagerly awaited red/white doglaration, and much to my surprise there was a second brush in the box - with a congratulatory note from IRC. Again I'm surprised, humbled, and honored by this community and its generosity. In appreciation of their thoughtfulness I figured I would use this brush first, and it only felt right to use the rest of the gear I took with me when he was born. I was afraid my son would [keep the brush for himself](https://i.imgur.com/KyttZb7.jpg) but he was gracious enough to let daddy use it till he's ready.\nIt's my last day off before I gotta go back to work on Monday, and I honestly can't say I'm looking forward to it. But it was a great and unique little staycation and if nothing else a return to routine will be welcome. Happy Friday everyone!",

The scent is quite muted and I'm struggling to pick out anything beyond \"faintly pleasant\". I'd not claim to be Luca Turin, but I have several years worth of picking out origin/tasting notes in beverages, namely coffee, beer, and recently distilled spirits. I generally can find *something* but today I just stood at my sink and my nose registered strained question marks.\n\nThe lather, of course, was delightful: no one needs to read yet another review of DG's buffalo fat soap.\n\nToday was my first shave with the V3. It slots in nicely between my Gillette Tech, which is almost cloyingly mild, and the V3A, which is nearly the wet shaving equivalent of coal rolling. I feel like I'm proving my manhood with that razor.\n\nRoam, I mean, with roam aftershave I feel like I smell like maple syrup and a bit of thyme or oregano scorched in a cast iron skillet over a hardwood campfire. I love it.",

This was a bad shave and a humble reminder that, no matter *what* your hardware/software is, if you check your technique at the door, expect a bad shave. And that's what I got. Blade-long nicks along the jawline, irritation on the neck. The one redemption to note was this new brooshki; it's freaking killer. As others have noted (I'm sure), the 24mm knot feels much bigger with the B5 qualities. Sweet, sweet lather release and decent amount of scrub and backbone.\n",

The angle took some getting used to, but it's really smooth. It takes a little longer for me to get BBS as I have to do more buffing around my neck but it's worth the extra effort, it definitely feels better than the R plate.\n\nIsland Man is a great scent! Smell a little like a fancy alcoholic beverage, great summer scent. Glacial after shave is no joke, this stuff burns!",

It has a fairly small bladegap (0.58mm) but very large blade exposure. It is what people call 'very efficient razor'. After the initial learning period, this razor has been a joy to use.\n\nI must say that I am slowly learning how to use a badger brush. As long as I take a dumb-proof soap (or cream), I can get a decent lather going with my good and dense badgers. So today was a good shave.\n\nHappy mothers day to you and to all the mothers around the world.",

It reminds me of SBSW with the lather, although the residual slickness wasn't that apparent as in other top-tier artisans. Full disclosure: I don't know the artisan personally 🤷♂️. This soap in particular is a really nice creamy sandalwood, which I thoroughly enjoyed. Also first time using the basic razor head from Charcoal Goods. The OC is quite aggressive, but it provides an efficient and close shave. Not quite on par with the set I bought as part of the new razor, but it's still a nice backup option.

I reached for this one because I haven't had a soap with pineapple or cactus in it. Neither of the two overpower the scent, and it resulted in a very nice, masculine scent. From the pucks, all the samples came away with a very masculine scent. I had a little trouble lathering as I must have had too much water in my brush, resulting in foam until I added some more soap. My razor was able to glide over my face without any tugging or resistance, although I did nick myself twice. I'm looking forward to using more of their products in the coming weeks!\n\nHave a great weekend!",

The scent is spicy tobacco, and the performance I find to be underrated. It's very slick, and the residual slickness is excellent. The post-shave doesn't quite measure up, but it's a small criticism. I'm glad that /u/chiseledface brought this one back by taking over production. It deserves to be around based on its merits.\n\nIt's going to be 92 today, which is a record. It seemed like a great day to break out Snake Bite for the first time this year. I'm not a huge menthol fan in soap (it's fine, but I don't love it), but I love the cooling menthol effect of this splash. It hits hard, and then it disappears a few minutes later. It's just so refreshing when the weather is warm.\n\nBack to the grind.....Happy Monday everyone!",

I think it was due, because I was rewarded with what might be the best and closest shave I've had since I switched to straights.\n\nIn other news the USPS can suck it. Saturday I had two packages (one shipment in 2 boxes) due to be delivered. They were together, both tracking numbers indicated they'd be out for delivery Saturday. USPS managed to only deliver one. How? I have no clue. My guess is the sorter was sorting, and when break time hit they got a case of the \"fuck its\". Lot of that going around the post office lately.\n\nNow the tracking says the other is out for delivery today. Uh huh. Sure. We'll see.\n\nHappy Monday ya'll.",

On the plus side, my wife likes the smell of 42. She judges it to be very floral while I get more of the tea scent. Then again, tree pollen is killing both of us, so that could be skewing opinions.\n\nYesterday we went through the storage room in the basement, reboxing stuff and throwing out stuff. I think the garbage pile has grown beyond what the trash guys are willing to deal with \\(now that it includes some chairs\\) so we're going to have to call the junk truck to come do a pickup.\n\nToday, the pod people should be swapping our full pod for an empty pod. Tomorrow, another batch of loading people should load the remainder of our boxes and whatnot into the empty pod. Today after work, the realtor is showing up to let us know how much we should be asking for the house. I'm just ready for all this nonsense to be done.\n\nI did ask the wife if there's room in our new master bath for the tall antique dental cabinet that had been living in our basement. I think it would make an awesome shave den. :\\)",

I don't know who \"they\" refers to in this case, but whoever it is is right. I got overzealous with my new razor and completely butchered my face with multiple cuts because I got too confident and changed my settings from what I used yesterday on the Black Beauty. Definitely not a fun way to start my morning, but live and learn (although I did learn this lesson when I started 5 years ago, I apparently decided that I had been doing this long enough that I couldn't cut myself with the razor that badly anymore). The moral of the story is to always respect the razor. Even if you've been doing it for what you think is long enough to be ok, you can still end up typing your SOTD with a Kleenex on your neck because you cut yourself so badly the styptic pencil won't even stop it.\n\n\nLavanille was awesome as always. It might be my favorite soap that I own, being the one that I always go back to when I don't have a set soap that I want to use that day.",

The AS burned for a good two minutes but after that it felt great. A good way to start this week's shave, I really have liked these Voskhod blades here at the end of my alphabetical blade sample.

After letting my beard grow out a bit and taking allergy meds, I feel like my skin calmed down enough for an easy-going two-pass shave.\n\nI finally got to break in my brand new Elite Razor Manchurian badger. This is my first custom brush and I'm v excited about it. I think I'm going to do an in-depth review on it after I have a few more shaves with it under my belt (and with much better, well-lit photos), but for now, I'll just say that it's a dream.\n\nI also continue my exploration of blades. I've been using the Kai blade in the Gillette Slim on setting 9 as a default to compare against since that's one of the best shaves I've had. Today, I got to try the Personna Blue and Personna Red.\n\nI've heard *very* mixed things about both, but in this combo, I'd personally put them on par with the Kai. I actually had trouble differentiating the face feel of each of them. I think I may have liked the Blues better than the Reds, but still...all three of them were equally fantastic.\n\nI decided to use B&M's Cheshire since I was testing out a new brush as well as two new blades, and Cheshire has been my #1 go to lately.\n\nAll in all, an incredibly satisfying SOTD.",

This was likely entirely user error, but disappointing nonetheless. PDP is the first and only full tub of soap I've purchased, and I want to love it because the scent is fantastic, but I just haven't been able to generate the kind of lather I've heard others rave about.\n\nI might have to try loading with a wetter brush than usual since it's a triple-milled puck, but I'm open to any other techniques which have served people well. The Gillette Ruby didn't help matters, but I'll have to wait and see if it feels better on the second shave.",

This was the first time I used the old spice puck. Scrubbed the little ship right off he top. The smell was good and I can confirm that Barrister's Reserve Spice is very very close. I need more work on the soap to get a good lather though. It created suds immediately and soap was falling right out of the mug, but the bubbles were too big. Went into anface lather and I could see my skin the whole time. Rinsed my brush, tried again, and this time I got what looked like good lather, but the slickness was severely lacking.",

The performance was as expected from SC, so I'll focus on the scents:\n\nBLUE: A bright tropical mix of mango, mandarin, red currant, dates, and coconut milk.\n\nYELLOW: Traditional tea, bergamot, mandarin, and grapefruit grounded by earthy tones with just a hint of spice from thyme, ginger, pepper, and nutmeg. (Note: this is definitely not a sweet tea, so it's very unlike the REFRESHMENT scent.)\n\nThere was also GREEN (an earthy vetiver-esque scent) but I didn't bloom it, as off the puck I knew this wasn't a scent I cared for. Surprising, really, as I like earth scents.\n\nAnyway, the blue is a very tropical feeling soap. Off the puck this was my favorite scent. It reminds me a lot of SoA but not as \"sweet\". Yellow (I didn't shave with this one, just lathered) was nice smelling, it just didn't have the summer feel that blue did. Blue gave me the image of being on an island with a slight breeze as you sit in the shade with a tropical drink.\n\nBlue will be my vote.",

First, the MdC came to me from a split. I have wanted to try it, but I wasn't interested in having a huge tub of it that I'd never use. The scent is very similar to LASSCO Black Fern, a soap I really enjoy. It has perhaps a little more grassiness to the scent than Black Fern. Very good scent, and I can see why people like this. I had no trouble whipping up a great lather with it, and the performance was slick. Post-shave is a bit lacking as has been stated by others. Overall, it's a very good soap. Would I buy it over a tub of LASSCO Black Fern (new formula)? Probably not. The scent in MdC is better, as /u/itchypooter has stated, but it's not THAT much better. And the price is pretty steep. The LASSCO slickness is just as good, and its post-shave feel is better. Still I'm glad to have gotten in on this split and to have it around.\n\nThe B5, as has been widely reported, is fantastic. The hair is very fine, and it's extremely soft. A beautiful job on the handle by Dogwood. I'm really happy to have this B5 now, and I'm already wanting another. The BAD is real.\n\nHappy Tuesday everyone!",

I don't know what scent I'm picking up most in it. But its an awesome cool morning scent. It's warm scent with the perfect amount of menthol. I'm kinda bummed on this blade though. First two shaves were great, this one tugged like hell. Maybe it was my lather, or maybe i can only squeeze three shaves out of a Voskhod.

I love Old Spice. I'm debating between a full tub of either the Stirling, B&M Reserve, or the Soap Commander Spice soaps when this sample is done. My recollection is that the SC soap has a little more carnation in it, which I like.\n\nThe razor is a flea market affair I got for $8. It was mechanically sound and just needed some rust removal. The adjustment \"sled\" was corroded in place before I cleaned it with some Bon Ami and WD40. It's now totally useable, but probably not a collector's piece. This weekend I'll try to polish it up and see if I can restore some more luster.",

This monster sequeway includes most of the second set and may be my favorite recording of live songs ever. Be prepared for almost an hour of mind-bending music from the Dead at their absolute best. I got up super early today to be able to experience this epic string of exploratory madness from the beginning of my shower through the final getting ready for work. My mind is still racing hours later as the synapses continue to fire and the joy still swirls. The Dead keep searching for the sound and they come as close to realizing it as is possible. \"The bus came by and I got on, that's when it all began | There was Cowboy Neal at the wheel of the bus to never ever land\"\n\nFor the shave, I had to bust out my 42 from last year. Such a pleasing scent which smells like all the possibilities of Spring. I'm sure I'm not alone in always thinking of [Jackie Robinson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackie_Robinson) and his grit, determination and perseverance when I think of 42.\n\nPost shave, CL balm and then more 42 goodness.\n\nHave a great day!!",

As with the other plates it offers an efficient, comfortable shave. I liked the C, loved the D (phrasing!), and the E is even better IMO. I had an awesome time chatting with Chris Kirchen, who designed the razor, and he offered a lot of insight into how he developed it, why it shaves so well, and how he machines all off the parts, et cetera... Anyways, if you're curious about the razor I definitely recommend pulling the trigger! Also, After the Rain and Champs de Lavande is a great combo :)",

I think I am still chronically under loading these harder soaps from sample jars, this is about 2/3 of the 0.25 sample jar and I think I have gotten six shaves out of it and there still at least one more. I should just be able to move on and toss these remnants, but haven't yet. Very happy with the soap performance, not super aggressive menthol but pleasant when going for the second and third lathers.",

I have varied between 3 soaps in the beginning, but nowi almost exclusivly use the taconic just to see how long it takes to go through. It is quite fun that i now can see the bottom of the tin (?) Through the soap. Down to less than 20% if my eye meausurements are to be believed. It is so fun! Yes thesoap cost more than shaving gel on a can, but i have used thw soap longwr than i would have with canned gel of same amount of money!\n\nI also like the astra blades. Actually mlre than Feathers. I dont have a favoyrite yet, but i certainly like this blade!",

I really like this cream a lot. It feels very fatty and rich. I always had trouble using creams until I realized that creams already have some water and I was using a brush that was too damp. It never felt protective. But, this cream has worked very well for me. It feels protective and very slick. Great scent too. I noticed that St. James has a new scent called tobacco and tonka bean, and I am interested in checking that one out at Maggard in a few weeks.\n\nHappy Wednesday everyone!",

She's the razor equivalent of a college [\"practice girl\"](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=practice+girl).

I tend toward dry skin so I've avoided them so far. This was very nice! There was no stinging at all, and I put on the salve afterward just to avoid any dryness.\n\nThe Schick is still a bit tuggy on my third use. This is a new blade that I know I installed without rubbing the edge. I think part of it is a sensation of tugginess because the razor is so light. It was a very easy and close shave, though, with no irritation. Maybe Personna blades would be better in it (these are Schick, and although I got them second-hand, I presume they are the newer Chinese blades).",

      "body": "[Last Night's SOTN](https://i.imgur.com/mbIPFtx.jpg)\n\n- **Razors:** Rockwell 6C and Fatip Grande\n- **Blade:** Kai\n- **Brush:** Elite Razor Manchurian\n- **Soap:** Barrister & Mann - Roam\n- **Post:** Chatillon Lux - Gratiot League Square salve\n- **Frag pairing:** none because I was going to bed\n- **Drink pairing:** Tall glass of ice water\n- **Song pairing:** [Alcest - Oiseaux de Proie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwE5FG-pIdk)\n\nThis was kind of a rough one, but also kind of good, too.\n\nI tried out these two new razors for the first time. The **Rockwell 6C** feels *significantly* different than my 6S did. To be fair, I had the older version of the 6S, but on the 6S I could feel the blade scraping my face away even on the R1 plate. With the 6C, I couldn't feel *or* hear the blade whatsoever until I got up to the R6 plate.\n\nI looked at the blade gaps between the 6C and the 6S and they are 100% different. The gaps on the 6S plates are incredibly large and barely distinguishable between each other, but the gaps on the 6C plates are smaller and milder looking until you get to the last plate (and they're also fairly indistinguishable from each other).\n\nTo top it off, the 6C was just *too* smooth, quiet, and mild of a shave for me to enjoy. I just don't understand these razors. Either Rockwell is utterly incompetent, I have just been receiving really bad batches of their razors, or they're just not for me.\n\nThe **Fatip Grande**, on the other hand, was a goddamn dream.\n\nNot that it plays into the shave itself, but the threading on that razor is possibly some of the best-machined threading I've experienced on any product period. Screwing and unscrewing the handle was weirdly satisfying compared to every other razor I've ever owned.\n\nWith the open comb design, I got a lot of feedback on that razor and I enjoyed it quite a bit. It felt aggressive but also smooth and efficient. I'll probably be keeping this one around, although I'm wondering if I'd prefer a Testina Gentile.\n\nFinally, **Roam** and **CL's GLS Salve** paired wonderfully together. I used to hate Roam. I was one of those people that just said it was a smelly cigarette ashtray, but these days I get a lot more of the thyme and earthiness that B&M claims.\n\nThe **Gratiot League Square** salve was my first time with this scent and also my first time with a CL salve. Holy shit, it felt and smelled so good. I'm usually a splash guy through and through, but the salve just felt wonderful.\n\nI usually like the initial sting of an alcohol splash, but with this salve, there was no sting and it was just an instantaneous soothing sensation. Really, really nice.\n\nAlso, the scent is hard to describe, but I think Chatillon Lux said it well on their site. It's got the tobacco note similar to Roam, but it's got a lot of florals and spice in there balancing everything out really well. Like I said, they were a good pair.",

Guess I should be thankful that we got our requisite 1 week of spring weather in.\n\nI'm beginning to appreciate my Stirling 2 band that much more after back to back days with the Yaqi. The knot isn't as dense, nor are the tips nearly as soft. It also seems to be a bit more springy than I prefer. I'm pretty sure I'm experiencing \"brush burn,\" which has never been a problem in the past.\n\nThe Ruby is plenty sharp, but not as comfortable for me as other blades in the Gillette line. As is the case with blade preferences, YMMV. Happy Hump day!",

In, I used all products that I love today, so I did the opposite of the theme.\n\nIt's been so warm that an APD shave sounded good today. I get very good results with the slickness of Fine soaps, and the bitter note that comes out prominently on Italian Citrus as opposed to brighter versions of ADP (like Oleo Shiloh) is nice to me. Great shave this morning. The B5 on its second use continues to impress. Fantastic brush. I don't think it's quite as soft as my B2 as it has been compared to, but it's also still breaking in an I expect that to develop a bit over time.\n\nHappy Thursday everyone!",

This thing is terrible. It's not surprising that I didn't use it for long. I bought it when I didn't know any better and there weren't many choices for synthetics back then.\n\nThe soap I keep around to defunk ne brushes. It is an okay soap, but most soaps are better.\n\nThis razor is something that I just can't seem to get the hang of. Ironically, I got the best shave I've ever gotten from it today. No weepers and no irritation. I'll have to wait to see if any irritation shows up later in the day.",

This is a Big fucking brush, so it has lots of room to hold in that ass stink. The big fucker did make a dent in my tub of soap, so that's a plus.\n\nHappy Thursday, which is usually my Friday, but I picked up extra hours so it's just my Thursday. Fuck work.",

Everything in this shave is stuff that isn't my favorite, but that I haven't gotten rid of for one reason or another. I like Stirling pre shave oil because I also have a beard so it's nice to use as a beard oil too. I do not; however, like the scent of Ben Franklin. It reminds me of a musty old farm house my grandparents had. Although its a cool scent association on my brain, it's not my favorite to rub on my face. I got Ouroboros when I did the mystery sample game. I honestly think it smells like Play-Doh. Play-Doh doesn't smell bad, but I typically don't rub it all over my face either. The Perfecto, my first brush, honestly it's not that bad, just not a good value for what it costs. It's nice to have around though for when my son decides he needs a shaving brush in the bath. The Old Type is just my least favorite razor out of all that I own. It also belonged to my grandpa so it's not going anywhere. I really don't mind Derby Extra blades, although I seem to get a few less shaves out of them than other blades. This is my first time trying one in the Old Type though, and it was not a good combo. Finally, I dont really enjoy alcohol free splashes (with the exception of SBSW, which is fantastic) this splash smells great (like oranges and basil), but I just don't enjoy how it feels.",

The triple butter and avocado base used in current PAA / CK products is a great performer, roughly a vegan equivalent of Glissant. The scent here is great if one likes powdery musk and incense (I do!), and the value at $15 for 4 ounces is great. But this is like the Tiger tank - a great technical design made by bad people, so hard to endorse with a clean conscience.\n\nBlade: Wilkinson Sword. Meh. Called a middle road blade, alleged by some to be milder than Feather yet sharper than Derby, I call it an overpriced Astra. Bought a hundred of these suckers, slowly working my way through them.\n\nScent: ESS is a fairly conventional design from IA, strong aquatic notes, which I am not fond of. Not an awful wear, but not as entertaining as some of IA's more outrageous designs. The marketing for this kind of makes it out to be more of a unique scent than it is, but \"hate\" is too strong a term for my feelings here. More like \"sample will get used up, but will not buy again\".\n\nEverything else on the list gets a thumbs up.\n\nSpecial call out for the brush --- All praise the Elite two bands (\"Manchurians\") -- can I hate these ridiculous badger marketing terms while still liking the knots? -- but many also regard other contenders as being superior (e.g. Declaration, Paradigm). I would say the Elite three band is a masterpiece though, assuming you would consider such a design. Softer tips out of the box than a Simpson Chubby Best, yet also more backbone, Plus its cheaper, and passes lather through more efficiently. More folks should love this knot, especially if you get it in one of Elite's fascinating wood or stone handles.",

Shave was incredible, will be keeping this in the rotation for awhile. Now to the theme shave. Its not that i hate 322 just not one i reach for. This is also the first soap i own that i tried to trade away (older version so no trade happened). Performance is good just the scent doesn't really do it for me. Interested to see what others used for their theme shaves. Have a great day everyone.",

I know it is an often-loved blade, but it just hasn't worked that well for me across a few razors. But, because of its reputation, I do plan on giving it one more shot in a different razor.*\n\nWhat is normally a super smooth razor, turned a little *pully* during this shave, during the first pass. Surely the blade is not dull after just 3 uses. So I must assume, since the lather from Proraso Blue was nice and slick, that this blade is just not a great combo with this razor *for my skin*. I was shaving off 2 days of growth, but any good blade will take care of that, *in my experience*, without a problem. Serviceable, and smooth on 2nd and future passes, like most blades, gives me a good result. Several hairs left with a little length in my tricky area ... but this shave was a quickie, and I didn't do my usual touch-up. No irritation or knicks. However, with several other better blade choices, I don't think having a supply of Crystals is necessary for me, considering the slight discomfort during the first pass.\n\nWhat surprised me was that after just 3 uses, this SOC Boar whipped up enough lather for 4 passes in the bowl and I didn't need to go back to the cream to keep quantity up. My first SOC took 18 uses to get to this point. Maybe it's because I'm dealing with a cream. I dunno.\n\nThis is also my first use of the Proraso White Post Shave Lotion, and it is working very well. I normally use the Red (love that scent!), which is more like an AS. But for the White, several hours after shaving, my face feels very hydrated.",

Wanted to go with a scent that wouldn't bug anyone since I'm getting my performance evaluation from the boss today. Luckily, I hadn't been shaving with my boar brushes for awhile since I thought they were bugging my skin so it *kind of* fits the theme. Turns out it was my technique with a razor so I returned to the boar brush to see what was up. Man, the 1250 whips up a fantastic lather so quickly compared to my bigger brushes. I could have done 4-5 passes as well but only did 3. It's nice to come back to your old gear with more experience and have a better time.",

The goal was to capture the scent of the dwelling of Cthulu, the city of R'leyh. It's a dark and dank aquatic scent with some muskiness to it. I'd place it in the middle of a Venn Diagram of B&M Leviathan and Storybook Hook. It is definitely a sister scent to Alchemist in terms of just feeling kinda \"evil\". I think the imagery is right on and I'm excited to get feedback from the testers I'm mailing samples to.",

It's just so damn good, not just the performance but the scent. It's really grown on me and is now contending with Seville for my all time favorite scent. Fern is so perfectly fresh and clean and green.\n\nI'm pretty sure I have finally decided I like B5 over B4. It's so incredibly soft. Such a great brush and because of this size of the Washington it's the perfect daily driver.\n\nTried the B plate again with this razor and this time paired with a feather. Holy shit balls it's good. Slightly more aggressive than normal but it's still very smooth and I got a hell of a close shave without any irritation or anything. This razor + blade + Reserve left my face feeling so soft.\n\nOff to another day at work, I saw someone else say this the other day so I'm gonna reiterate it, work sucks. So glad it's Friday. After work me and my wife are heading up to Yosemite for a wedding and going to spend the weekend there. Somehow I've never been even though it's not far but I'm looking forward to seeing how beautiful it is.\n\nHappy Friday shit heads, hope everyone has a good weekend!",

I've had good luck with What the Puck soaps (terrible name, great performance!). My favorite is the Blue Barbershop, but the orange is pretty nice too. For a triple milled soap, they lather very easily. The slickness is the best aspect of it--it's extremely slick. Finished with Snake Bite, it was a very refreshing shave.",

I have yet to find a shave soap/cream that my skin likes better than Cade. The scent is subtle enough that you can pair it with anything you want. I tend to pair it with Santal Austere to help keep it neutral, especially on Frag Fridays. Helps the frag come forward.\n\nHave a nice Friday everyone!",

That will wake you up in the morning.\n\nI've cut myself a couple times now, but what has always amazed me is how nearly invisible the cuts from a SR are how quickly they heal. As long as I'm careful there tomorrow, by Sunday it will probably be gone.\n\nThanks very much to /u/aymanem for the Flying Hide sample. I really liked flying hide, exactly like I expected I would. And it pairs nicely with The Captain splash.\n\nHappy Friday to all you barrel chested stallions of personal hygiene!",

Trumper Lavender Water Cologne\n\nDeclaration Grooming/ Chantillon Lux nailed this soap and aftershave toner on the head. Pure Lavender is just that a pure in your face experience of what lavender is all about. Beautifully soothing and calming scent throughout my shave. I shaved at 4 AM, it is now 9 AM and this natural lavender cloudy heaven is swaddling me in soothing whispers of it's beauty. The bison formula is the truth, slick and an excellent performer. The soap is just awesome.\n\nThe toner is just as magical in scent, with actual lavender specks floating inside the formulation, just a wonderful experience, the restrictor is damn good, the heavy glass of the bottle is a nice touch. The only negatives of the experience had to be the cap. The bottle cap seems to be a bt loose, which cause some product to leak, Thank God that Maggards put it inside a plastic bad and then bubble wrapped it all, also thankful that it was a small leak and did not lose much product. The last negative has to be the label. For a bottle this nice, the only real way to go is to get glass printed labels \\(like Barrister & Mann's Reserve aftershaves\\), these cut and taped labels won't hold over time. Other than that the Pure Lavender set lives up to the challenge and has thus unseated a big favorite of mine Mike's Natural Hungarian Lavender as my top lavender.\n\nI highly recommend this soap and aftershave set for the true fans of lavender, this my friends is a must own.",

I presume the maker. So what will the next model be called? CB2? Named after another family member? Anyhoo, great razor, the radically exposed blade ends on the sides of the cap are unique, and the handle pattern is really nice. An amazing deal, given the weak Canadian dollar. Many who buy Rockwells should also consider this model - the Rockies give you more plates at once, but in my case, I use the same one over and over again anyway.\n\nBrush: Sleeper surprise! My first Yaqi. We have a tortoiseshell cat, so the name \"Mew Brown\" made me a little nervous, but I am happy to report that no cats were plucked in the making of this product. It's a synth designed to _look_ like a two band badger, but it shaves like a combo of the Cashmere and the Tuxedo. Easy splaying, soft tips, but the short loft gives it more backbone than the Cashmere. The semi-opaque brown resin handle is lovely, sturdy, and ergonomic, and the knot had no stank at all and did not lose a hair.\n\nOnly shortfall: the usual 40 second load I use for synths gave barely enough lather for a three pass. 24mm Cashmere or Tux by comparison gives more than enough lather for four or more passes. Could just be that the brush is new, and in any case, I had enough lather for a normal shave, so no demerits here.\n\nI liked Yaqi / Ali Baba too. Lots of communication and very quick shipping. Probably not my last Yaqi...",

I still like my Kai blades better, but I enjoyed the Rapira Platinum Lux quite a bit too. The Rapira Stainless was perfectly passable but nothing to write home about.\n\nI recently cleaned, sanitized, polished, and lubed up my Slim. It looks fucking wonderful. That being said, since oiling it up with mineral oil, the open/close knob is really smooth but that last \"click\" at the end is really tough to twist. I almost have to use my other hand to hold down the head of the razor to get it fully closed or opened, which is obviously dangerous if I have a blade in. I'll just wait and see if it gets smoother with time and use.\n\nCaptain's Choice was a sample I got in a swap. I really like Bay Rum, and Captain's Choice seems like one of the modern go-to recommendations for Bay Rum, so I thought I would love it. I actually like my Taconic Bay Rum better. The lather was really hard to dial in, but the scent was quintessential Bay Rum.\n\nI also appreciated Captain's Choice Cat O Nine Tails splash more in this shave. It's surprisingly moisturizing for a splash.\n\nI also got that nifty shaving bowl from TJMaxx (missed out on the Proraso while I was there). It's just a marble mortar and pestle. It's the perfect size, look, and weight that I wanted in a shaving bowl, and it also has a textured bottom which helps with building the lather.\n\nThat just left me with the pestle, which I didn't know what to do with until I realized it makes a good muddler! I like old fashioneds, so I've been using it to muddle sugar cubes for a few days now, and it's great.",

      "body": "*Razor*: Gillette **Fat Boy** (setting 4)\n*Blade*: Personna **Crystal** (5)\n*Soap*: **Black Ship Grooming - Captain's Pipe**\n*Brush*: **Golden Nib** Silvertip, Grade A, Badger 24mm in a Mozingo handle\n*Prep*: Splash of cool/tepid water\n*Lather Temp*: Cool/lukewarm\n*Post*: Cade Post Shave Balm\n\n-----\n\nFinally a razor where the **Crystal shines** for me in every respect! Tried 3 razors previous with this blade and each had weak points that made it not worth having a Crystal in my blade stock (since we have so many choices). With the Fatty handling the Crystal really well, *for my skin, at least*, I'm sure other vintage Gillettes will work with it as well for me. Of course, for you, it may be different. Very comfortable shave, with neither nicks nor rash. Slightly above average result as well, in terms of trouble spot neck hairs cut.\n\nThis lather was nice and **slick** and had good cushion. However, there wasn't tons of residual slickness. It was very slick while on the face, but when shaved off, you have several seconds to come back to it with additional buffering, otherwise you are best-served to re-lather. But the trade-off is that it's much faster to rinse.\n\n**Lather scent** was very nice if you like cherry-ish pipe stuff. Loved it from the puck and when I stuck my head in the lather, it was a nice strength. However, only smelled it lightly while lathering and shaving ... I'd say a 2 or 3 out of 10. But for me, the scent is unique and enjoyable enough, that I'm willing to keep this one in my den, despite the light scent.\n\n**Soap economy** was surprisingly good. Most soaps (at least what I've tried so far) that are soft (like WK, SBSW) require the whole 1/4 tsp to give me enough lather for 4 passes or so. After 4 passes with this 1/4 tsp mix, I had enough lather for 3 more!",

It's a good scent but, unlike most of the other soaps in my possession, I have to be in a very specific mood to have this be my preference. Well, I just so happened to be in the mood today. Performance is pretty killer on this, so that really helped with the fact that the Polsilver in this razor straight up *sucks*, dude. Shambalah was a great finish, one of the very few citrus favorites I have.\n",

That vintage AdP smells much stronger than the newer version. Lovely stuff. Performance does not threaten the donkey or bison standards, but the smells are there. Classic stuff right here.\n\n**Public Service Announcement**: It's graduation season in Boston (and everywhere else). Congrats to all the new graduates. However, if you happen to have your graduation ceremony today or tomorrow in my neighborhood, please ask your aging parents to leave the car keys at home, and walk or use public transportation. They do not know how to drive the big f&%$@ing SUV you bought with their money. It's going to be safer for everyone, especially for my kids.",

I have tried just about every synthetic on the market except for a few. This one has been on my list for a while, and from what i read its the same as the APShaveCo Faux Horse, just bigger. Before i used it, i thought it may be close to a BOSS knot, but upon first use it is much more similar to a Cashmere knot with perhaps a bit more backbone. The backbone is still pretty low when compared with other synthetics like the tux and the plissoft style. All in all i am pretty happy with it, it is super soft!",

Today was my first time revisiting the B&M Reserve base since I really started figuring out how to lather. Today's lather was honestly the best I've ever had, and I can definitely see how this base is rated so highly. I'm now fully convinced that /u/BostonPhotoTourist is a magician when it comes to making soap.\n\nThe Reserve Spice scent is a dead ringer for my bottle of Shulton, and it definitely felt like the right choice for a rainy weekend day. I also still absolutely love my Black Beauty. I turned the aggressiveness up by one on each of my steps now that I have my technique down with the razor, so that it is 8 WTG, 6 XTG, and 4 ATG. It gave me the single best and closest shave I've ever had.\n\nEnjoy the weekend, everyone!",

It's heavenly for a hot day. I love the citrus and floral mish-mash that these products bring to the table.\n\nI decided to give the Rockwell 6C another shot. This was actually probably the best shave I got out of this razor, but idk, I can't put my finger on it, but it's not for me. BTW, I still have this razor up for trade. Looking for anything from CL/Dec and/or Wholly Kaw.\n\nThe coffee was great. Been buying a local roaster's beans lately and I always feel like the beans make the difference, no matter which way I prepare it.\n\nNautica Voyage is a super cheap frag that you can find in the likes of Ross/TJMaxx/Marshall's for sub $20, and while not the best thing in the world it has a wonderfully breezy sea feeling to it. Great for spring/summer.\n\nFinally, decided to revisit Django, going with that early 20th century feel with the whole gin theme.",

For me, it was rough for the first pass, and not as bad on subsequent ones. Resulting cut was above average, but not comfortable. No nicks or much r-burn, though.\n\nThis is a Fougere that I can really enjoy. Too many are floral-focused, but I really enjoyed the green and grassy notes here. Performance was great. I stretched it out thin this time with plenty of water and it held it's composure. Thick and cushiony, or super-hydrated and slick, depending on what you want... this soap base is flexible and does it all. I was also pleased with the scent strength, rating it as a 4 out of 10.\n\nThe Boar is just on maybe it's 10th use and is doing just fine! Taking less time to break in than the last SOC I did. 8 uses and we were in business, with the anticipatory knowledge that he'll keep getting better and better with each use!\n\nI love the economy of this soap as well, with me only needing about 75% of a 1/4 tsp to make plenty of lather.",

I'm starting to think that when a ring finally appears, I'll only have a few shaves left.\n\nThe Semogue continues to break in nicely. According to the internet, it's a floppy brush but so far, I'd have to disagree. Still a contender for a favorite boar right now.\n\nThe Yaqi is often overlooked but it's a fine razor. Very mild yet very efficient.\n\nHave a good one!",

Mostly cloudy, with a high near 75. Southwest wind around 10 mph becoming west in the afternoon. Winds could gust as high as 20 mph. New precipitation amounts of less than a tenth of an inch possible. High tide at 4:11 this afternoon.\n\nDecided to see how this little brush did with the Stubble Buster. It did rather well. Loaded for about 20 seconds and had enough lather for 2 passes plus my normal lather while I clean up. If I had stretched it I could have done three passes, but doing three never bodes well for my face. Over all a very nice shave this morning. Have to start getting out of bed a bit earlier to get my shaves in, as the wife is back to work today after vacation.\n\nHave a nice Sunday everyone!",

One of those **tiny chrome bowls** you can get on ebay for about $2.50. Pretty good quality it seems. Conk's 2.25 pucks (as well as Haslinger's) fit right in. Obviously not as much room to load your brush as a Stirling container, but cool and compact, and much nicer than the plastic tubs that Conk's comes in.\n\n**Lather** was great, slick as usual. Conk's can take some water, that's for sure. Makes it a nice flexible soap, depending on how you choose to mix it.\n\nIt protected me well against the **lightly rough Zorrik** blade. This blade turned my normally mild .68 Timeless into a razor that felt much more aggressive. I won't be bringing any of these blades into my inventory, even though the roughness was drastically reduced from the blade's first use. To add to the \"Cons\" pile, the result shave was average, to slightly below average.\n\nSo, for my skin at least, this is **not a good pairing** of razor and blade.\n\nThe **brush** has lost almost all of the prickliness that I felt initially, now that I have about a dozen uses with it. However, what I felt tonight was **wiriness** as I was scrubbing and a little of it while I was doing painting motions. Seems like it comes from the sides of the bristles as the knot is splayed. I'll keep monitoring that. So far, I like the TGN Premium ST a **lot** more than the Grade A.",

My issues with them is they are horrible for under the nose (unless you go against the grain) because of the angle. You can go XTG under the nose and it works well. And the handle is just too damn small for me. I'm sure if I used it daily, I could adjust to it.\n\nThis will most likely be my last post on here... until Saturday. ;-)\nI am flying out to Houston for the week and will be skipping shaving. It is NOT golf this time but for business. I *might* try and procure a ticket for tonight's Indians vs. Astros game. We'll see.

New soap mini-review? Check. As-yet unexplained Masters of the Universe gif? Check. I can hear it now: Woah son, it's Sunday morning. Slow your roll.\n\n[Can't help it. Too excited.](https://media.giphy.com/media/mbTaFQPK6iqEo/giphy.gif)\n\n**Soap**:\n\nFirst up, I got to try the new player on the block, /u/Ross314's Red Panda Soap. Yuzu Kumquat is a very bright citrus scent. I'm not usually a citrus/floral guy, but this scent is solid, and I enjoyed it much more than I expected. The soap is soft, almost croap territory, coming out of the tester. But it lathered very easily in my bowl, and went on my face easy for a very slick, very nice lather.\n\nThe citrus is strong, which you would expect after pairing Yuzu and Kumquat. But it manages to not be overpowering. Residual sickness is excellent. Post Shave - unknown, I'll have to experiment with that one. I threw on some witch hazel and balm without thinking about it.\n\nOverall, Red Panda Soap is a contender. Definitely commiserate with the quality of soap that current artisans are routinely churning out, and the quality we've come to expect as a matter of course.\n\nI would like to see more /other scents offered from Red Panda, but Yuzu Kumquat is a killer opening salvo.\n\n**Victory**:\n\nI've been trying to learn to hone razors so I can maintain my own SRs. Last night I finally got a wicked pissah edge on the Torrey I've been working on. This morning's shave confirmed it.\n\nIt only took a week...it's not *that* long... ok fine, so I'm the slow kid in class.\n\nWhatever, I'm still gonna be proud of my drawing. Even if it's supposed to be a turkey, but it's purple and green and mom and dad thought it was Ben Franklin in the Magic School Bus. I'm still proud. Still gonna hang that bitch up on the fridge, front and center next to my all \"C\" report card from last quarter.\n\nDid I do a little bit of a [He-Man reenactment in the bathroom today](https://i.gifer.com/FUM.gif)? Yes. Did my wife judge me? Also, yes.\n\nGood journey.",

I wouldn't be opposed to buying that one again, although I'm still enjoying my Kai blades by comparison.\n\nFinally got the Synbad knot. I've been diving into badgers lately, so this was my first time with a synthetic in a few weeks. It felt fantastic. I like it a lot better than my tuxedo knot. Also, this is another one where pictures don't do it justice (especially with my bathroom lighting). [Here's a *somewhat* better pic](https://imgur.com/a/OCQyp1w)\n\nI think it might be softer than the Tuxedo, but if it is, only by a slight margin. The density, backbone, and splay compared to the Tuxedo is where it really shines.\n\nDefinitely the best synthetic I've tried and in a pretty neat handle. It's a little more yellow than true butterscotch, but it's less yellow than Andrew's stock photos, which are a liiiittle too bright imo.\n\nMdC Fougere is still amazing. I actually had an excellent lather and post-shave feel with this one. I almost didn't need any aftershave, but I used a dab of Stirling unscented balm for a couple areas that were irritated. Nothing I've tried so far has paired so well with Green Irish Tweed than this.",

Perhaps its only because one artisan that i know of sells it. Their etsy page sells it as the \"most dense packed knot on the market\" which seems quite true, and it is also very very soft. I was however very disappointed with its lack of backbone. I would say it has less than the cashmere knot, but perhaps it just needs to be set much lower in the handle.\n\nAnother shout out to Larry at whipped dog, as his super affordable handles makes testing out knots very easy and at very little risk. the handle i placed the knot in was ten bucks if i'm not mistaken and certainly gets the job done.\n\nAs i don't think i will be reaching for this brush much, i would be willing to PIF it to anyone who reads this, only thing i ask out of that individual is for them to share their thoughts on the knot with me.",

Southwest wind 5 to 10 mph. High tide at 5:12 this evening.\n\nNice shave this morning. Wanted a little scrub this morning, so I picked out the g_huck handle. While the knot isn't as big as I would like it for a head shave day, it performed adequately. Should have loaded for a bit longer as the second face pass lather was getting a bit thin, but was still manageable.\n\nSupposed to be warm today so it's time to pull out the Colbeck. It was oh-so-nice and refreshing this morning, helped wake me up more than my cup of coffee.\n\nHave a nice Monday everyone!",

And the first shave on a fresh blade is usually a little rough for me, so I can only imagine how good it'll be next time.\n\n\nBut for some reason, the sensitive patch on my neck that always gives me trouble blew up with bumps and burn.\nThis was well after alum and aftershave, which usually calms it down pretty quick.\n\n\nSo I'm not sure if it's the soap (first time using Mystic Waters as well), or the blade.

It was exam week, but it was also the week of my birthday and my sister's graduation. I spent way less time studying than I anticipated and was pretty nervous for the exam. Ended up flagging less questions than normal (we take out exams on ipads), so I'm hoping that's a good sign and not a bad sign. Grades come out this week and I want to know if I passed ASAP :p Also flying home today for a couple weeks, so I'm excited to see my family and stuff. I should probably pack before I leave in like half an hour though..",

This is a show in the Dead's own backyard and they come out firing on all cylinders! Throughout 1972 the Dead played 2 epic, mind\\-bending jams: Dark Star and The Other One. I have featured Dark Star a few times \\(with more to come\\). For today, it is [The Other One](http://www.dead.net/features/greatest-stories-ever-told/greatest-stories-ever-told-other-one). For these epic jam songs, the Dead often use a simple song as the launching pad and The Other One starts simple, but then the band takes to you places you may have never been before. This version sees the Dead travelling through the stratosphere with such amazing phrasing and lightning. Jerry does this amazing thing starting right around the 20 minute mark where he turns on his [wah-wah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wah-wah_pedal) pedal and plays descending arpeggios while lightly pressing on the wah-wah. The effect is absolutely mind-blowing! \"The bus came by and I got on | that's where it all began\"\n\nExtra Credit: Same show, the segueway starting with [Not Fade Away](https://archive.org/details/gd72-08-22.sbd.cotsman.11472.sbeok.shnf/gd72-08-22d3t03.shn) all the way through the end of the set is amazing energy. The Going Down the Road in particular is awesome!\n\nFor the shave, back on the every other shave with Summer Storm. I have to trust the process even though I don't see much more progress.\n\nPost shave, CL balm and then some of my homemade Bay Rum. Bay Rum is such a great smell and so easy to make DIY.\n\nHave a great Monday!!",

Te Java\n**Post Shave:** [Wholly Kaw - Washington's Blend - Toner](https://trythatsoap.com/collection/251/?product_type=toner)\n\n**Mini Review:** Thank you for subscribing to my YouTube channel. I'm here again for another exciting description of some shave soap! Today's review: Turtleship Shave Co. Te Java. Let's first talk about this scent. It's tea. And sweet. Somewhat on the gourmand side with how sweet it is. It kind of reminds me of some candy. If you can get over the sweetness there is a nice bitter scent behind it all. The smellz are ok. In my opinion there are better tea scents out there like B&M 42.\n\nThe performance is good. It's up there in the pack of almost everyone but doesn't compete against those great bases like WK DM, B&M Reserve, and L&L Bison/Icarus. The lather is on the thinner side and I found myself using too much water at some points. The protection was there and glide was good. I could use this base anyday.\n\n[Now, I went into this briefly](https://old.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/8i4b01/wednesday_sotd_thread_may_09_2018/dypfg6s/) but I had some issues with the soap itself. I bought this back late last year and used it a few times. I set it aside for a month or two and noticed a thick, clear, brown substance separating from the soap. When I used it again the soap itself just crumbled and turned to mush with water. It was weird. After a few shaves the puck went back to normal. I lost about half of the soap though just from that. Disappointing.\n\n**Would I buy it again:** Probably not. There are too many other scents that I prefer over this. I would however recommend it to anyone if they haven't used Turtleship before. It's a good soap base. I just have too many and other things I like over it.\n\nIf you liked this mini review, don't forget to smash dat like button and subscribe. See you next time folks!\n\n*Insert transitional exit music and roll credits*",

The lamb tallow has the same performance as the all duck and duck plus beef tallow. GD does not need all these bases - it has to cost more to produce and stock so many diverse bases. This one stings moderately though, even in its third use, so I presume scent mix and I are not compatible. Will move this off of the Favored Fifty and onto the bench for incidental and unscheduled usage.\n\n* Brush: Why I no longer buy fountain pens. Different colored resin bodies contain the exact same internal components (nib, feed, converter) made by one of two or three companies. After a while, you end up with the exact same pen in different colors even from ostensibly different brands. As so many new brush makers enter the fray, most using the same few knots, we approach a similar problem.\n\n* Resin brush makers need to aim for either a relatively unique knot (many try this by claiming personal selection of knots from Chinese suppliers) and / or aim for unique ergonomics so as to stand out. WWB ergonomics on this model are very good, but am not sure I would buy a second one from them unless they change materials and / or knots up.\n\n* Frag: Timbuktu works well the the CL salve. Powerful vetiver and incense notes along with Iso Super E aplenty. A two squirter if there was ever one, but beautiful, unique, and complex.",

Had some good results with the mild 34C. Will probably continue to use it in the future if the next few shaves continue to go well. Also realized the cashmere knot is way scrubby compared to the tuxedo knot I already owned. Just doesn't splay easily, so it has taken some getting used to. Got the hang of it now, I think.

For me, just not a good blade. Across a few razors, rough feel and slightly below average results, even in a normally-mild #3 plate from Rockwell.\n\nThe P-Green soap took a lot of hydration, though, and didn't break down. Nice slick lather. And though I don't like Eucalyptus or menthol, there wasn't enough in this lather to bother me. Just a cool, light, fresh sensation from the menthol. So I liked the soap more than I thought I would.",

Good soap. Good brush. Good razor. This is another of 3 or 4 bases that I could forget to use moisturizer afterwards. The scent is either mellowing or it's growing on me or both. I wasn't particularly wowed by the scent at first, but I actually enjoyed it today.\n\nI am so damn glad I stuck it out with this brush. It has really turned around and become a good one.\n\nLong day ahead.",

Weird! Bronze watches patina noticeably in less than a month, but the Timeless still looks basically new. Different alloy I guess! I could artificially age it using some mix of stuff, but I am happy to let it mature at its own rate. In any case, still shaves well, amazingly so for that wee 0.38 blade gap, and today's shave proves it does well with mild as well as sharp blades.\n\n* Blade: Derby Premiums should get more love. Roughly the same price as the much maligned Extras, but they start sharper and stay sharper, and are as smooth and mild in face feel as the Extras,\n\n* Brush: Amazing that the STFs used to be considered the best synthetic brush (circa 2014-15). They still go for more than $100, but most modern shavers will probably like a $25 Tuxedo better, I think the change in perception was due to the fact that the STF was meant to simulate a Simpsons three band and few consider that goal to be a worthwhile one for a synth now that the short lofted two band badgers are king.\n\n* The STF is too high lofted for me these days, and feels both overly springy and hard to splay. These are both relative problems when compared to modern BOSS and Tuxedo knots, as in its day, competing against contenders like the Omega Hi Brush, the Muhle seemed devoid of such issues, The splaying gets easier as the soap and water permeate the knot more, but the first few minutes are a chore.\n\n* Given the continued high price point, the changed consumer standards, and the unfortunate tendency of the STF fiber to get bent relatively easily, I think these knots will continue to decline in popularity.",

We spent Saturday and Sunday getting the last of our stuff out of the house. Yesterday, I grabbed the last load of stuff after dropping the kids off at school. Supposedly, the carpet guys came yesterday to carpet the basement and the junk guys came to haul away all the trash we've generated over the last couple weeks. I'll find out when I drop the kids off at school today.\n\nToday included, I have to drop the kids off at school 22 times, which means getting up between 5 and 5:30 if I want to do any amount of personal grooming before throwing the kids in the car because the teenbeast's school day starts at 7:20. Luckily, the teenbeast has late start all week due to standardized testing, so I don't have to have them there until the kindergartner's day starts at 8:20.\n\nIt was so nice to get up this morning and have a proper head shave. My morning grooming routine really does make a lot of difference in how I approach the day.",

The third pass(ATG) is where this razor shines. It is what people call an efficient razor, so I got a near bbs shave on my neck without much effort. Still, the lack of burn from alum and the aftershave splash was the real surprise. I was expecting a lot more burn but got almost 0.\n\nGranted a good prep and lather (GD Elan is great) helps, but still. What makes the experience even better is that I got this razor (+ stand) on a trade for my Wolfman handle only. I know it's a Wolfman, but to me, a great razor with a stand for a great handle is always a good trade.",

I was surprised to find that they got delivered this morning, since their estimated arrival date was June 11.\n\nI was so excited, I couldn't wait. I set up the stones on my bathroom counter and put an edge on the 8074. It took an edge fast and effortlessly. And sharp. *Holy crap* was it sharp. And it was an outstanding shaver. Smooth, easy, nimble. I see why they are so highly regarded.\n\nThanks to /u/ChrisVanMeer for putting me onto Hayashis. He spoke so highly highly of his Diamond 1000, I wanted to try them out for myself.\n\nHappy Tuesday ya'll.",

      "body": "*Razor*: Gillette **Red Tip**\n*Blade*: **Viking Sword** (1)\n*Soap*: **Soap Smooth - Fougere**\n*Brush*: **Golden Nib Grade A Silvertip**, Badger 24mm in Mozingo handle\n*Prep*: Splash of cool/tepid water\n*Lather Temp*: Cool/lukewarm\n*Post*: Proraso White Post-Shave Lotion\n\n-----\n\nBeen too long since I've shaved with this great razor! This was my first time trying this blade and for this razor, it was **just okay**. The results, after 3 passes, were not that good, with some length left on many of my neck hairs. Another neck-only pass with a lot of strategic directional strokes redeemed it somewhat and made it about average. Will have to try this blade in another few razors to give it a fair shake, though.\n\nLather was **very slick**, as usual from this base, and the scent, was low (3-4/10), but discernible enough while shaving to make me enjoy it. I normally don't like fougeres because they're often too heavy on the florals. This one, I do like because it's more green/clean.\n\nThis is also a soap with **good economy**, because I ended up with a few more passes of lather than I needed when I used 75% of a 1/4 tsp of soap, with 3.5 tsp of water. So a better soap amount may be 50-60% of the 1/4 tsp measure, and that's half of what some soaps take to give me enough lather! So if budget is a concern, giving you more shaves per ounce, this looks like a very good soap choice.",

Luckily, I have some new competition for it soon which will likely ensure its bench warmer status. On the topic of brushes, those green Stirling 2 bands look fantastic. Sadly, I already have the black, and can't justify buying a duplicate (yet).",

I've used no. 63 before but not the original. I recently managed to pick up a puck. I enjoyed the smell more than expected. It's sort of herby and sagey, but it's also fresh. It's a pleasant combo. The size of the puck at 5.25 and triple milled is almost ridiculous. I can't imagine how long this would take to use up but it would be a very long time. I can see why this is often recommended as the best value soap available. Slick performance and would last forever.",

It is hard to pick which of our scents is my favorite, but lately I've been leaning towards Picture Day. I love the way lavender and bergamot smell together and then I love the way lavender fades in with the rest of the notes to create a barbershop scent that is both familiar and different. I've grown to absolutely love my Jefferson B3. I've never tried the other knots from DG, but I wouldn't hesitate to get another B3. This Fatboy was replated and fully restored. It's amazing how well it shaves when restored back to what it was like from the factory. It's definitely one of my favorite razors.",

Comfortable and above average results. This is another blade that looks like it needs to be used just a bit before it gets good/smooth. This was the second shave with the blade and it was very comfortable, and cut well, too. No irritation that a decent balm couldn't easily squelch. At $17 per 100, I think it's a great deal, too... if, of course, they don't fritz out before a reasonable amount of uses.\n\nBefore these two shaves with the Viking's Sword, I thought they were just a one-off or old brand that wasn't around any more. But in getting a price for them for this write-up, I discovered that they were by Personna (Israel plant), one of my favorite makers. Nice!\n\nSuch a smooth and beautiful lather from Stirling. Very slick, of course, and I do love this scent. One of my favorites from him.\n\n\"Viking Sword\" ... \"Mountain Man\"... definitely should have shaved with a straight with this one! :-)",

Well, the second was even better. I got (almost) the perfect shave: easy (as in I don't have to concentrate super hard), close (near BBS), comfortable (0 alum burn, I mean 0, no redness) shave in a limited number of passes (3).\n\nI have other razors with which I can get a similar shave, but not consistently with this kind of ease or without touchup. To say that I am pleasantly surprised by the shaves would be an understatement.\n\nI am trying to finish this cream so that I can get a soap or two during Maggards meet without overflowing my den space. Also, I think for us hobbyists, creams are better in tubes.",

It quickly became my favorite scent and even almost 3 years later it still is. To me the scent of wet shaving is Seville. It just smells so good and brings me back to my first great shaves and from then on I was hooked. Every time I use it I go back to that. When Will released Barrister's Reserve line the first thing I thought was how could he not do that formula in the Seville scent. I've always wished it would happen and wished there would be exclusive runs of fan favorite scents in that formula. The other day I saw ~~someone~~ /u/steelersroc86 say in here he wished Will would do it as well. A guy can dream right? Or maybe all we have to do is just ask nicely?\n",

Northern Elixir is basically just eucalyptus and menthol (think Vick's Vaporub). I really like this soap, but I love eucalyptus so that's no surprise. The Noble Otter performance just ticks all of the boxes for me, and I can't wait to get a full tub of the new products to experience the improved base because it was already one of my favorites. The strangest thing I could think to pair this with was Visions and Revisions splash. Visions and Revisions is a lemony tea scent, and also one of my favorites.\n\nI thought these would be odd when mixed, but the longevity on the scent of Northern Elixir is not long at all, so by the time I mixed in Visions and Revisons it was barely there. A bit funky, but not as bad as I expected. Now, I'm smelling like Visions and Revisions, which is always a good thing.",

And this knot is amazing, but took a bit of break in to be more efficient with lather pass through.\n\n* Scents: Glissant (newer) Roam has more obvious thyme note to it than my older WL tubs do, and a grassy leathery scent. YRP has nothing in common being all citrus and floral. And FDJ is a smoky jasmine, in theory maybe having some commonality with Roam, but the smoke effect is achieved entirely differently (little to no birch tar) and as a result FDJ is smooth and delicate, with prominent jasmine made even more \"gentlemany\" by carnation, amber, and vanilla. It has very little to say to YRP and Roam, three very different strangers wedged next to each other on the metro...",

I have an office picnic today, so figured I'd go with something light and summery to go along with being outside in the Tennessee heat. Today's basically my Friday cause I'm taking a personal day to spend at the flea market tomorrow. Gotta search for some more vintage razors! Hope everyone has a great day!\n\nEdit: forgot to list my brush",

No tugging/pulling sensation even during ATG pass. No burn from alum, absolutely 0. I was afraid that I would get some burn on left side of the neck as I did some touch\\-up passes without lather \\(which was sub\\-par today\\). But didn't.\n\nToday's shave was a tiny bit less close than yesterday. I mean if I really push my fingers ATG in one/two places, I can feel some whiskers. That can be due to two things: I was being too lazy about angle today, or this razor 'utilizes' the blade faster than others. I am inclined to believe it is the former.\n\nAnyway, couldn't be happier with this razor.",

But life has been so hectic, I'm just glad I found not only the time to shave but also the time to record my shave. Will and company sent a 3\\-pack of Reserve soap samples with my 42 order, so while I'm familiar with the AS scents from previous samples, this is my first time actually trying the Reserve base. I have to say, that is a solid, high\\-performing base. And while \"Cool\" was the only scent I enjoyed on my first pass through the AS samples a few months ago, I really liked the smell of Spice this morning. It's a masculine, nostalgic smell. Will shave with again.",

Great combo with the Nacet. Cut like a straight. The cutting feeling was firm, and it was like the blade was 3x as thick. Smooth, no irritation, nick-free. Great result, too. Seriously, what a performer. Exemplifies a mild experience, with premium efficiency and cutting power.\n\nLather was superb, with long, elastic peaks and slickness for days. Scent was a bit weak, maybe 2-3/10. But there was enough, while lathering, to contribute to the experience, especially due to the excellent performance.\n\nScent, for me, was 90% ozone, clean water, etc. And I couldn't pick out the rest. Something a little *brown* was my best guess, like a woody, or musky note.",

But it's a \"dirty aquatic\" scent. Very nice, balanced, and not overpowering at all.\n\nAnd of course, it has all of the outstanding performance that Southern Witchcrafts soaps have been known for.\n\nTempest was the only aquatic AS I had, but it paired wonderfully. Arcane Abyss will be available mid-June.\n\nHappy Thursday ya'll.",

Yuzu\n\n**Aftershave:** MLS Paradise Frost\n\n**Razor:** Schick Injector E-Type\n\n**Brush:** Dogwood Handcrafts Tortoise Shell with a cashmere knot\n\n\nI didn't recall to engage in the them for SOTD, so I paired an AS to this soap as best as I could. Yesterday was my birthday, and my mom actually understands my collecting habits so she bought me this Schick E-Type and the Item 9 Soap. The soap is from a local (to her) artisan in Yuma, AZ. I couldn't find much online about him, but he sells his wares at local farmer's markets in Yuma.\n\nThis base appears to be vegan, but from what little I did find online (a shave video from Cap) it seems this artisan has other bases as well. The scent is a pretty straight forward yuzu citrus scent. It's nice and strong.\n\nThe soap performed well, although my wife rushed me a bit this morning so I don't think I did a great job of dialing in the lather and I ended up with some irritation on my neck. I'm inclined to blame that on myself and not the soap. It wasn't as slick as many of the bases I'm used to using, but it still lathered easily and provided good cushion, I'll just need to take more time to dial it in next time. I like patronizing local artisans, so if I happen to be visiting and can track this artisan down I would certainly consider buying more of his soaps.\n\nThe razor itself was great. I had to clean it up a bit but it turned out beautifully and it's my fourth injector (first e-type). I really like injectors. I don't shave more than a couple of times a week and I feel like injector blades perform better on 3-4 days growth for me than DE blades do.",

I know he sent out a lot of these samples so we'll be seeing other reviews in the coming days. I have used all of the Southern Witchcrafts soaps at some point, so I have a familiarity with them. This scent fits right into the Southern Witchcrafts line up. All of their scents are complex, and usually have a prominent dirty note. I'm not going to even attempt to list the scent notes, as they are numerous. It's a dirty, musty aquatic. The scent is blended in such a way that I couldn't pick out any individual notes. The sea notes such as kelp do come through, however, in terms of the overall scent profile of the soap, but there's an overall musty dirtiness that wraps around it. If you are a fan of SW scents, you'll like this one a lot. It's a great addition to the line up. Even for someone like me who prefers simple, cleaner scents, I enjoyed it and I'll definitely use it again.\n\nI was again surprised by how slick this soap is having not used a SW product for a while. It's impressively slick, especially for a vegan soap. It's a solid performer in every way, with the post-shave being my only (very minor) knock against it if I had to offer any criticism. But truly it's a worthy performer, and belongs in the market. Overall, another great product from SW!\n",

This brush is one of the most luxurious knots I've ever used. While being very soft and easy to splay, it still has enough backbone to get the job done. The Bic blades were just an add on to a recent order and I've been pleasantly surprised with their performance in a few different razors so far. In other news, the Barbiere Sapone smells exactly like La Toja. Looking forward to the long weekend. Happy Friday everyone!",

There was a little talk last night in IRC about Bufflehead and rare soaps (and whiskeys and anything) in general, and the tendency some of us have to hoard rather than use their best things. I can see many areas in my life where I'm guilty of the same thing, but I didn't think I applied it to my shave stuff (LE or permanent it usually all costs the same anyway). I'd like to think I rotate all my items pretty equally, but in case I'm not I want to make sure that I make an effort to use the more unobtainable items as well.\n\nSo, here I am. I originally was going to pair Armada Blossom with Herbie, but then I thought come on - a super unobtainable soap *and* a super unobtainable splash? That just seems unfair to anyone who may happen to stumble upon one of the items and then still want the other. A bridge too far I thought, so I pivoted to Catalan's Prairie. Yes, that does indeed seem to make a good pairing. But then I thought, why go from super difficult to moderately difficult - why not just go for something readily obtainable? Thought about things, looked at my shelf, saw those Clubman Reserve bottles I picked up and only used 1 of the 3 so far. The memory of my mail call and the short descriptions on the labels thought it might be an OK fit. By this point, the scent of the soap had mostly worn off anyway and so FYI: I think you can pair just about any AS you want with any Bufflehead, because the soap scent is pretty fleeting (by design) and shouldn't clash with your AS or fragrance. So I sniff the soap, sniff the splash, \"yeah, this should work\" I thought to myself. And yep, I'm happy with this pairing. And as it turns out, the Hermès is an even better combo with the Brandy Spice.\n\nHave a good Friday all, and hope you can enjoy a 3 day weekend as well.",

This is the best buffing blade I've tried so far, and it's a very smooth shave while being incredibly close. I can see how nice these are once you use them for a while.\n\nIt does take a full shave to get sharp because of the Teflon coating, but it seems like it will hold its edge for more shaves than usual.\n\n\n\nIt's gonna be a nice and mellow, yet busy day. I have 36 or 37 hours in for the week already, so I'm just going into work for a few hours in the afternoon. Still dropping the kid off at day care though so I can get some stuff done around the house without interruption.\n\n\n\nHave a great day everyone!",

Not Sahara dry, but definitely you're-not-done-with-foreplay-just-quite-yet-Paco dry.\n\n**Edit 4:** 1 and a half hours post. Tightness set it. Post-feel game has gone completely off the rails.\n\n**Edit 5:** And done. Post-shave products applied.",

For that reason, of course, I had to break into the Beaudelaire. As usual, performance was amazing and the song and dance of the scent during the shave was nothing short of spectacular, as always. I debated wearing any type of fragrance, but I opted to wear it, since I can usually catch glimpses of Beaudelaire throughout the day.\n\nEnjoy your Friday!",

Only small issue is that every once in a while, ol TJ coughs up a stray hair, which happened today. It's like finding a bolt under your car in the garage every once in a while. Hopefully no big deal. Or maybe the whole engine will be falling out one day. I had a Shavemac ST die in a similar manner - occasional hair loss here and there... and then, BAM! Lost 20 or 30 hairs per shave until I eventually benched it. Hope TJ will not go that route.\n\n* Soap: Charkalis, the Benito Mussolini of wet shaving, does not disappoint here. The base performance is great, approaching WKDM tallow in quality, and the scent is fun, complex and rich. Only oddity is that the ingredients on side of tub do not say \"tallow\" but the top label does. Feels and looks like tallow, but an odd QC slip nonetheless. Price is quite reasonable. There's some Clockwork Orange vibe in the marketing here, not sure why. Anyway, price is reasonable, base surprises, smell is quite nice.",

I felt the blade wasn't sharp enough today which is strange considering I regularly get a week's worth of shave with this brand.\n\nAnyway, so I had to do a touch up pass to clean a few areas after my regular 3 pass shave. And that led to a tiny amount of alum feedback. But still a lot less than what I was expecting.\n\nI can't say it enough: shaving ATG with this razor is like a dream, a good one that is.\n\nI am really trying to finish this cream before potential purchases from Maggard (meetup) as I don't have any more space left in the den.\n\nEnjoy the long weekend, and I guess remember what memorial day is all about.",

I was not thrilled with any of them really. So for the past two years i have been using exclusively synthetic brushes. I was recently inspired by Ruds Shaves videos and purchased a manchurian white badger knot from elite razor and put it in a spare handle i had. I probably should have done a test lather first as the first shave was not terrific. Still has that same wet dog smell and it was kind of scratchy, but i may chalk that up to first use and not being used to natural brushes. Time will tell, and i look forward to using this the next week to see how it goes.",

I've been on the hunt for a Franklin for quite sometime and somehow it all came together and I got a B1 Frank to add to the den. I'd also like to take a moment to thank Mr. /u/Nex_renegade for the personal invite to join the fine folks over on IRC.\n\nAs for the shave, this soap is damn cold. I'm not sure that I'm cut out for the heavy menthol soaps. The soap was so cold that I didn't even get a great shave because of the pain it was inflecting on my face. To make matters worse I decided since I was using my \"Big Boy Gear\" I would man up and splash my face with cold water afterwards....ya I didn't like that either.\n\nEnjoy the weekend boys, I hope everyone gets to spend sometime with family and friends with a nice cold one in your hand, soda or beer, beer is my preference, but to each their own.",

To me, KAI seems definitely sharper than Wizamet. Today's shave resulted more alum feedback than last 4 days, also got my first Cut. These can be due to the harshness associated with a fresh blade or my lack of attention. But still, lack of any alum feedback on my problem areas was a great feeling of achievement.\n\nI recently ordered a MWF soap and dish from [Connaught Shaving](http://connaughtshaving.com/). Unfortunately, the dish came broken. Connaught promptly refunded me. I was planning to grate the soap into the dish. I had to use a Maggard PTFE container instead.\n\nThe brush is also new to me, picked it up recently from the bazaar. The first shave was great, but I am kind of glad I didn't pay ~85 USD for this one.\n\nAnyway, very good lather today from MWF. overall, not a bad shave.",

I'm beginning to understand how you can say a brush holds \\(as opposed to builds\\) enough lather for 3 passes. There was next to no lather in my bowl, but the brush itself was just bursting with the stuff. Heck, when I was done, I squeezed enough lather out of the brush for probably two more passes \\(and thus the common assertion that Chubby brushes are a great way to waste product\\).\n\nGray skies over Lake Union this morning.

I just did the with the grain pass to start to get a feel for it. I picked up the razor on the bazaar about a week ago. Unfortunately, I think the blade is due for a hone. I think I'm going to send it off so that i can for sure rule that factor out and then really work on my technique. I really enjoyed the process of stropping and getting ready for the shave. I'd also love to get a hone eventually.",

It was oddly stormy & cold here yesterday so I felt Spice was fitting and I was definitely right. I could go on and on on the performance but I've done that plenty before so I won't, I'll just say that it's the best of the best. I will say, I do really like the scent on this one. It's very warm, spicy, yet still very clean & fresh. My kinda jam for sure. Most definitely a classic scent and I feel like this is the perfect scent to use in fall/winter. Especially with the nice warming sensation you get from the aftershave it's perfectly fitting. Viking was the best frag combo I had and actually it worked quite well. Both are spicy & clean scents. Viking has a minty aquatic notes to it that definitely makes it different but they complemented each other quite well actually. I really like Viking, it gets a lot of hate probably because of the way Creed hyped it up, but it's a great scent and honestly it's probably my most complimented from others. Will is probably gonna perma-ban me when he finds out I like Creed but I can't help it, the nose knows what it likes :)\n\nAnyway, happy Saturday all! Thank god it's a 3 day weekend!",

Leviathan still tops the charts for my favorite soap. Not crazy about the Polsilver SI but it was great to use it to compare the razors with. Rockwell still doesn't really click with me, but the Fatip and Merkur are both fantastic.\n\nGot to try my first Dogwood handle from /u/Ptheven_j courtesy of /u/Hyvasuomi79\n\nFirst time with a plissoft-type knot too. I still would probably reach for the Synbad if I'm going to go the synthetic route, though, so I'll probably be dropping a badger in this soon. Handle's great though. The swirling accents are really subtle and classy. Glad I got to see what Dogwood's work is all about.",

Oh well, it happens. I bought my ticket to the meetup yesterday on a whim while at Maggard and am very excited. It is definitely a perk of living in the area and not having to make a huge trip to go down there. Can't wait for it and hopefully will see some of you guys there!\n\n\nThe shave today was excellent! Today was my first time using a full size of Chiseled Face, and I am definitely a fan. It made a fantastic lather, and the post shave feel from both the soap and AS were top notch. I'm thinking that at some point down the line, Ghost Town Barber will be in my future.\n\n\nHave a good holiday weekend, everyone!",

Cloudy, with a high near 57. East wind around 10 mph, with gusts as high as 20 mph. High tide at 10:55 tonight.\n\nGot home from work to this brush waiting for me in the mail. For those that don't know my Paladin Sumo is my favorite brush. So I saw that /u/Ridgeback_Dad had a shop, and was willing to do customs. I asked him to do a Sumo shape I just wished it was a little larger, with the bottom bulb being a bit bigger than the top. He asked about material and I thought wood would be a nice option seeing as I have metal and resin. So I gave him three different types of wood to see what he could find. He kept me up to date through the process, plenty of pictures, and asking for my input. He shipped it directly to Scott because he didn't want me to pay shipping twice.\n\nHe did a fantastic job with the brush. It's a bit bigger than the Paladin Sumo and fits my hand much better. More comfortable to use as well. Over all a very nice brush that I'm sure I will come to like more and more as I use it. Will go into the knot a little later as I have to get going to work.\n\n[Obligatory Pictures](https://imgur.com/a/Dlo7Gak)\n\nHave a nice Sunday everyone!",

Stirling's margaritas in the Arctic was a good choice on her part with the menthol. The rinse of the excess lather after shaving felt like holding an ice cube on my face. Don't have a matching post shave, so decided to keep the menthol train rolling and use Declaration Try This Soap.\n\nUnfortunately, I have to work today.

I wanted the Saponificio Varesino 70th anniversary, but couldn't justify that cost. I also found some soaps that were on my wishlist but ended up not liking the scent at all. I picked up this Dr Jon's, it has a very nice lather! Also picked up a backup Stirling Unscented balm. On the recommendation of /u/hyvasuomi79 I picked up some Permasharp blades. The first shave was very nice, I'll see how it goes the rest of the week.",

The Tech was a stable cutter while also being comfortable and efficient. The blade was terrific and I didn't really need to do a neck touchup pass after the third regular pass. This is very uncommon for me. No tugging at all , which suggests that this blade can go a reasonable distance. Very little irritation , which is remarkable considering the efficiency of the shave. The irritation that was there was easily calmed by the scale polish. Some blade feel, but it was not rough , instead it was predictable and consistent. This blade and this razor continue to be a great pairing, at least for my skin.\n\nThe lather was very very good and creamy and slick and protected me well. The cherry pipe tobacco scent was also present, which I do enjoy. However, there was a funky rancid like smell that was a little more dominant and I guess that was perhaps from \"tallow funk\" . I'm going to leave the puck open for a few days and see if maybe that will depart.",

Time to start thinning out the collection, also in part because then I can justify to the wife buying new releases.

Extremely smooth.\n\nI picked up this soap today because I am looking for another soap to sell and this looked like a good candidate. But now I am not so sure anymore.

I had gotten this for my room mate some time ago, but he stopped using it because he says it made his skin burn. I figured I'd give it a test run. Scent is very lite, loads easy, lathers easy. It did burn on my mustache area, but I think that is because I have been blowing my nose a lot recently due to allergies. Floid Black soothed any and all of it away. Now off to Shoprite to get BBQ supplies for the Memorial Day picnic or if weather goes bad, hanging out at the apartment and playing PS4 with friends.",

The scent is very complex and changed during my shave and even more significantly during the dry down on the AS.\n\nMy wife liked the complexity and came back for a few whiffs but ultimately decided that while she likes it, it's not her favorite because it seems old-fashioned to her. I actually really like that about the scent and enjoy it a lot. I just recently bought Grey Flannel cologne for the first time and feel it will pair nicely with that.\n\nThe performance was excellent, but that's expected from SBS at this point. I really like how soft and \"stringy\" this soap is (similar to Declaration Grooming in that respect).\n\nThis is definitely another great offering from /u/Fahrenheit915",

I like this blade with this razor. efficient as well as comfortable. A little blade feel, but just fine. This was a test to see if the VS blade would hold up for 6 shaves and it did well. Didn't tug at all. I'm sure it can go farther.\n\nLather was terrific. took a good bit of water, and stayed together nicely. This is a dense soap in the tin, so don't let that small tin fool you. I used 1/4 tsp of soap and had about 3 passes left of extra lather at the end. So i can reduce that starting amount with no problem. Tune in the water the way you like it: luxurious and creamy or slick and super-hydrated. Handles it nicely. However, this scent strength just wasn't where I want it. Maybe a 3 out of 10. Good scent though. not that complex, but pleasing. Is a Green Irish Tweed facsimile. And I think the Old Spice was a great pairing at the end.\n\nThis brush is doing so well at just 10 uses. Able to use it normally. my other SOC took 18 uses, where this one took just about 6!",

Like Black Fern, it has added charcoal, which makes it look very different than other soaps. The scent on this one actually reminds me of Black Fern in a bit, but of course with the rose added as a note. It was pretty nice. I only had a sample, and I'd love to smell it in a full tub, which I'll do at Maggard this weekend.\n\nThe performance of the new LASSCO formula continues to impress. Slickness and post-shave are vastly improved over the old formula. I had a very nice shave this morning. Back to the grind....",

The consistency is very soft and gooey, like a denser, less airy version of the Declaration bison tallow base.\n\n\nThe extremely soft soaps tend to work out well for me (as well as the extremely hard, go figure), and I had almost instant lather as soon as I started loading. This base reminds me a lot of Declaration's base, with maybe a tick less performance in all your major areas.\n\n\nIt whips up to a very dense lather that checks all the boxes: above average cushion, slick enough to get the job done, and nice residual slickness and post shave feel.\n\nThe cushion was maybe a notch under Declaration's (so better than most), and peri-shave slickness was more than adequate. Residual slickness was good enough that I was able to buff a few spots after two full passes without reapplying any lather.\n\nAs for the scent, I really enjoy it, and I don't even like citrus scents. It just smells like good citrus - not candy-like, not like wood floor cleaner, not too sharp or too sweet; just good, solid citrus. And obviously, it pairs well with Chatillon Lux YRP post shave provisions.\n\nThis is a really solid opener from Red Panda. I get the feeling from this soap that it's one of those reliable, predictable products that once you use it twice, you know what you're getting before you even stick the brush in the bowl.\n\nI'll be picking up a full tub of this, and I can't wait to see what new scents are released in the coming months.",

So, another long day ahead. Good shave, Arcane Abyss is another great scent from Southern Witchcrafts. I've never tried aquatics before, so I feel like I need more time to really break down the scent. Smells, well, aquatic in a cologne-y way. There's a heavier, almost earthy element that I can't place. Regardless, it's a success in my book.\n\nHope y'all have a good Tuesday, and fuck work.",

First time using Tabac, and first time using a shave stick. I can totally understand why some people wouldn't like the scent. I don't mind it. It reminds me of how all of the old men smelled at the Methodist church. Kind of what I would consider a classic scent. Also the first time using the Reserve Spice sample I got when I bought my 42 set. I've never been the biggest Old Spice fan, but I don't mind this one. B&M's aftershaves have been nothing but amazing on my face as far as feel goes, even if the scents aren't always my thing. I think I'm one of the few that doesn't care for the Reserve Cool scent. The initial scent on that one is nice, but it doesn't age well on my skin as the day goes on. It became kind of musty in a not so good way. Hopefully the Spice doesn't do the same thing.\n\nMemorial weekend was great. Scored a Flare Tip Superspeed in box and a Lady Gillette at the flea market. I gave the lady gillette to my girlfriend who tried it out yesterday. It took her a while, but didn't nick herself and said it was the closest shave she's had. I also hit another antique store and scored a Fat Boy in box for 8 bucks. Needs some cleaning, but it's in pretty damn good shape considering the age. Can't wait to shave with these guys. Hope ya'll have a great Tuesday.",

Soak the puck for several minutes (doesn't have to be warm water either, I used cool)\n2. Start with a damp brush (not wet; I shook all the water I could out) and load for about 30 seconds, then put a little water on the soap (i used 1/4 tsp) and load for another 30. I think most folks are loading with a brush that's starting out too wet.\n\nThese two changes gave me a wonderfully slick lather with cushion and a luxurious feel. And I never saw that bubbly, airy part of the lather that I think too many people try to shave with. And no lather dissipation at all.\n\nThe shave with all the details, and some skip-to links in the description:\nhttps://youtu.be/YdpuB_42OGc\n\nThe Nacet worked so well in the Fat Boy, and the Williams was so protective, that I bumped up the Fatty to a 7, where I don't usually go. I was rewarded with a great shave and no irritation at all.\n\nSure, it smells like a citronella candle, but it was actually quite weak, to my nose, at least, when shaving.\n",

Decided to keep the moustache, soul patch and chin patch. My Parker shavette with a Shark blade is the perfect tool to get the shape perfect. I've had this sample of Stirling Clean forever. Can't remember what it's supposed to smell like and there's not much scent left. Maybe a slight soapy smell. Performance is excellent and I can see the bottom of the tub. Really enjoyed Barbasol Brisk's menthol in this Texas heat. Jumping on the bandwagon I picked up a few tubs of Proraso Presahve at Marshalls. I've wanted some since trying it in a Bazaar lot and the price was too good to pass up. Gifted one tub to my bro for his birthday. Sip some iced tea in the shade and take it easy this week!",

TeV was my favorite beta soap during the testing process. The vanilla was toned down a bit from the original and has resulted in a beautiful blend of vanilla tea and strawberry with a perfect presence of Jasmine. I myself like that the scent is based around loose black tea smell, akin to opening a tea tin or bag and taking your first whiff.\n\nOverall this scent is a jackpot. I think Cody did a fantastic job. So much that it may possibly edge Barrbarr off and become my favorite. If you are considering trying Noble Otter, now is the time! The new base is top tier with great cushion, slickness and post shave feel. To me, the AS is just extra icing.",

The lather was exceptional, and the post shave stood out. The Adumbrare was as close a match as I had, and it worked well. Y'all have a nice day.",

      "body": "Soap: Noble Otter The Noir et Vanille\n\nBrush: Dogwood Timberwolf\n\nRazor: Rockwell 6C\n\nBlade: Perma Sharp\n\nPost: Lucky Tiger splash and balm\n\nI was very excited to receive a tub of the new /u/NobleOtter The Noir et Vanille yesterday. This is a black tea scent, with the added notes of Berganot, Jasmine, Strawberry and Vanilla. Wow, this is a great scent. The tea is definitely present, but you get the fruitiness of the strawberry, a very slight floral from the jasmine, and a smoothness from the vanilla. The bergamot works perfectly with the tea and lends a slight sharp citrus smell. It's so well balanced, and I kept smelling the tub all day yesterday. Just fantastic. I unfortunately did not buy the matching aftershave, but I might have to rectify that with my next order. Someone else compared the scent yesterday to Night Music without the funk. I haven't smelled Night Music, so I can't comment on that.\n\nPackaging: The new packaging is really first class. The metal tins have been switched to white plastic Parkway containers, and they are sturdy and very nice to use. The new matte labels look great, and the design of course, is one of the best on the market right now imo. It's a vast improvement over the old packaging. One other cool aspect of the new design is that Noble Otter put labels on the side of the jar, which have not only the name of the soap, but also lists the scent notes. That's a great idea, and I wish more companies did this. For those that like to pair frags or non-matching aftershaves with their soaps, it would help matching.\n\nPerformance: Noble Otter changed the base for this revamp, and I was very excited to see how it compares to the old base. Again, I'm very impressed with the change to this soap. The slickness was terrific, and the residual slickness and post shave are top tier to me. When I rinsed my face, I felt a layer of fat, which to me signals my face has been protected, and is going to be moisturized and happy. And now, a couple of hours after the shave, my face is indeed very, very happy. The soap loaded and lathered easily, and likes quite a bit of water. But, with a little work and a water, you're greatly rewarded. This is just a fantastic soap all around, and ticks all of the boxes for me.\n\nSo, my verdict is that Noble Otter has a real winner here. The combination of the packaging and the performance of the soap makes it absolutely competitive with the top tier of soaps available from our favorite artisans. The scent on this soap is wonderful, and if you've been on the fence about it I'd highly recommend picking up this one or BarrBarr.\n",

B5 is the the tits, Reserve Fern is da bomb diggidy, yadayadayada. So I scored a few vintage razors over the weekend and the kind folks over here helped me out by telling me how to restore these. Honestly I got pretty crazy lucky considering I got this slim for like $8 and I could tell there was nothing bent, broken, or pitting, or anything like that. Just a build up of soap scum. The dish soap and hot water soak basically took everything off and they were probably good as is just from that. Regardless I still used the scrubbing bubbles to get anything left off as well as further disinfect. Then I took a rag, some q tips, and flitz to them and they all turned out looking insanely good. I was pretty blown away to be honest.\n\nI wanted to try the slim first so that's what I went with. I used the lab blue because they're an easy blade to use, smooth, not too sharp, just very easy without having to worry. I love mild razors so I set the slim to 1 thinking it would probably not cut much and need to be turned up to 2 or 3. I was very surprised, it cut everything very well and to me was pretty close to the perfect amount of smoothness, aggression, and blade feel. While this won't unseat the Karve as best razor ever, it's a contender and I'll definitely keep it in the rotation. I was able to get a great shave off of a couple days growth in 3 passes and zero issues with irritation. Even went ATG on my cheeks and without any issue. I can definitely tell the Karve has a really solid hold on the blade compared to the slim. Both give great smooth shaves but the Karve feels really solid not just in hand but also on your face with the blade as you shave. The slim on 1 feels similar to the Karve A plate, but the Karve has a little less blade feel with the same amount of aggression. The slim really shines in its ability to change aggression on the fly but also how easy it is to change our blades. I do prefer the lightness if the slim compared to the Karve though. I've never loved heavier razors as much as lighter ones, but I can't deny the Karve handles her weight well.\n\nI'm really looking forward to using the the super speed flair tip next, as that razor turned out beautiful as well. Big thanks to everyone for helping teach me how to clean these razors up. It was almost effortless!",

In an effort to pare down my den, I figured I would pit similar smells against each other and see what I like best. The performance on the cream was not nearly as bad as I had expected (maybe the CL Toner saved the day?), and the scent is definitely better than all the dupes. Scent and performance was definitely way better than the one time I used XXX Ufo, so either I didn't do something right that day, or I'm gonna say they're different things. Either way, I think this AdP is a keeper and 4&P and Shiloh soaps will probably have to hit the road. Fragrance wise, the 4&P Toner is a great pairing and very enjoyable, plus that sweet CL performance. I ought to also try out APR Fresca to see which complements it better as they both perform exceptionally well with only the price point (and smell) separating them. The 4&P EdT is almost certainly going to go, as I not only prefer AdP Colonia way more, have a ton of it, but also I get a weird celery type note out of it. Anyway, pretty great shave, and trying to get in what I can before I become a slave to the Games.",

I'll try the blade in a different razor eventually and see how it works there.\n\n* Razor: Timeless Bronze in its third set of 4 uses - trying to use this till I see prominent patina or get bored.\n\n* Post Shave: As I used this great scent and sadly discontinued product this AM, I thought to meself \"Sad it's gone. Glad that CL salves are still around!\". And then I got to work and read the DNP thread from yesterday... Ah, the grim and bitter irony! It's like \"Gift of the Magi\" but much sadder. And there's no combs or watch or girl... OK, maybe it's not _that_ much like O. Henry's finest. But it's still damn sad!",

They both did fine, see second two pics in the album for lathery brush and bowl shots. I couldn't tell much of a difference in slickness, I think there was slightly better post shave feel in the AA that I used for the second and third passes.\n\nI really dig the scent, I remember smoke and salt were supposed to augment the mariner theme. As with other SW soaps (I have used both Nekro and Lycan) there are a lot of notes mixing in the profile. I would say that the strength out of the puck is slightly less than those two soaps, but in my book that is okay since those were very strong. My mind kept being brought back to my time as an altar boy surrounded by wafting incense and organ music, and am not surprised to see that listed in the scent notes (thanks /u/Dr_Facilier). I can't say that I can pick out all of these, but I would say that it is my favorite scent of theirs that I have tried. A great take on a unique scent that fits right into the rest of their lineup. If you haven't tried SW before, I encourage you to look them up on etsy and give them a try.\n\n>Scent Notes: Sea salt, Cedar, Litsea cubeba, Smoke, Ambergris, Incense, Laudenum, Cyprus, Sandalwood, Leather, Sea water, Opopanix, Amber, Kelp, Lavender\n\nThanks to /u/phteven_j for providing me the Arcane Abyss sample, I bought the rest of the setup with my own money.",

The old base worked so well with my skin and this new formulation is even better. Lathers like a dream. I hardly had to add any water and still got an ample amount for three passes. The protection and glide is fantastic.\n\nThe new aftershave was very different from what I've been used to and it turns out I love it as well. It's almost like a light oil for the lack of a better word. It felt nourishing, and I didn't miss the alcohol burn like I thought I would. My skin felt soft and smooth. It still does the next morning. Also, a little goes a long way.\n\nSo yeah, Cody knocked it out of the park. I can't wait to tear into my sample of Lonestar next. Lonestar smells exactly like what I think of when I think about being outside in the summer.",

The **Nacet blade** continues to dominate and worked very well in the Guerilla. The results, after 3 regular passes and one neck only pass, was significantly above average.\n\nThis was Williams attempt #2, where I modified yesterday's process (a successful one) just a bit.\n\n* I soaked the soap for more like 6 mins instead of 10 yesterday.\n* I reduced the damp loading time to 30 seconds (half as long as yesterday), while keeping the wet loading time at 30 seconds\n* I also used a big ole Badger brush instead of yesterday's Boar.\n\nThe end result was that I still ended up with 3 extra passes of lather at the end of my shave. So maybe that 30 second wet loading time is the most valuable player. Also, I probably should have stuck with the same brush, to eliminate more variables.\n\nBut I added the **badger brush** mostly just to see if it could produce a great lather like the boar did yesterday. Just to be able to say if brush type is irrelevant. And I did find that the lather was terrific and the brush type is indeed a non-issue. The lather, while being mixed, was a little more airy/dry than the boar gave me yesterday, but it calmed down nicely once I added enough water. And this is almost a floppy badger, not one with good backbone. So it proves that even a soft badger can make Williams work exceptionally well.\n\n**Face feel after the shave** was nicer than yesterday, which leads me to think that the tiny irritation before was more a result of the aggressive nature of a Fat Boy set on 7 instead of any minor caustic properties of the soap ... at least to some degree.",

Post shave is right up there with WKDM imo. I really didn't need an aftershave, but wanted to see what the matching aftershave was about. I don't feel I can comment on slickness just yet, as I'm at a hotel with hard water and this was my first go with the new base. Need another few shaves to get water/soap level right. A/s is good, no sticky feeling but the scent really shines in the a/s.\n\nOff the puck and during the lather I get mostly black tea and vanilla. It's nice, but not quite as bright as Paris tea. On the dry down of the a/s the bergamot and strawberry start to poke out and after about 5 minutes it's damn near the exact scent that you would get from the drink. I've had the aftershave on for about an hour and half now and the black tea is the prominent note, but that hint of strawberry is still there.\n\nOverall, I love this scent and props to NO for upping their base in regards to post shave feel. If you enjoy Paris or other tea scents, this one is a must buy.",

This is actually, technically, my first time with Summer Break Soaps.\n\nDon't want to give too much away, because they still might be tweaking things for the final product, but it's definitely an interesting one. Fragrance-wise, it's got notes of chlorine and fruity drinks. It's bright and citrusy with an aquatic scent that gives it the feeling of hanging out at the community pool on a hot summer day.\n\nI really think the fragrance is spot-on with this one.\n\nThe cooling effect is different than anything I've experienced before. I'd say it's somewhere in between Stirling's \"Menthol\" and \"Glacial\" levels of cold but it's a slow build. When it finally builds up to its max coldness, it lingers for a long time and it seems to radiate beyond where the soap or aftershave was applied.\n\nAlso, post-shave feel is fantastic on this one. I was surprised the splash was as nourishing as it was.\n\nShave-wise, I kind of had a rough one. That's on me, though, not the soap or aftershave. I compared Kai and Feather. I do think Kai is smoother and more effective, but they're pretty close. Not sure which one I like more, but Feather seems like a more everyday blade considering it's half the cost.",

I was rewarded with a non rabid Flying Hide and LoneStar set.\n\nAt first off the puck the soap doesn't smell quite as \"bright\" as the sample of LoneStar does. However after letting the tub settle in for the night, collect it's thoughts and acclimatize to its new home: it smelled much closer to the sample I have.\n\n**Conclusion**: despite their amicable and adorable appearance, Otters don't take no shit, and don't enjoy being stuck in a hot (mail) box.\n\nThe performance is outstanding, as expected. /u/Hyvasuomi79 and /u/aymanem already mentioned NobleOtter's new base: it is an improvement over the old (very good) base. This new scent is wonderful. It's lemon without being overly sweet. And \"green enough\" to compliment the lemon for a great summer smellz.\n\nThe longevity and power of the splash really stands out. As I write this, I just spent an hour standing in the sun, talking a wanted fugitive out of a house at gunpoint. Do I smell of man sweat and poor decisions?\n\nNope.\n\nI smell as clean and crisp as I did when I was shaving in the locker room 3 hours ago.\n\nToday's game ball goes to /u/NobleOtter, **but clearly the real winner here is my car partner, who gets to smell these wonderful smellz all day for free**\n\n**Edit**: Just got in a foot chase. Still smelling lemon sage grass 4+ hours after application. This splash is legit.",

For that reason, it's my desert island soap with the rest of the gear posted here. Rockwell is still my best performer and I will miss it thorugh the next 30 days of using different razors.\n\nThis is also a good wake up call, nobody needs 30 razors; if you rotate and use (and you should use them) it takes 30 days to get back to the first one.\n\nSo this is the format I intend to use if the tabled formating ok for tracking purposes? Just in case, I added additonal lather line below the table but I will gladly remove it from future posting if it's not necessary.\n\nGood luck to you all!",

I've been proper wet\\-shaving since 2006 when I got tired of paying for cartridges frequently. I had a job at the time that required daily shaving, and I only got 2\\-3 decent shaves out of a Mach 3 cartridge. Found a set of AoS back in the day and became enamored with it.\n\nOnce it ran out though, I saw the cost of replacing it, and started looking at other decent and well reviewed creams of the time. I liked Nancy Boy a lot, but eventually settled on Proraso which I used for the next 10 years or so. It wasn't until I somehow came upon a tub of Seville that I really fell down the rabbit hole. It remains one of the few soaps that I will always replace when it runs out, and I constantly find myself just smelling it because of the amazing scent. The only other soaps that get the same treatment are things with the Colonia fragrance.\n\nMy 34C has been the stalwart razor that was my first significant hardware purchase back in 2006. I rarely use it anymore, but it still provides that amazing shave that I became used to when I was first starting out. My 620, you'll have to pull from my cold dead hands. It's my favorite brush of all time, and it isn't even close.",

      "body": "[SOTN 5.30.18](https://imgur.com/a/cgRe12J)\n\nRazor: Gillette Super Speed Flare Tip\nBlade: Personna Lab Blue\nBrush: Barrister & Mann Synthetic\nSoap: Wholly Kaw La Fougere Parfait\nAftershave: Reserve Fern w/ a dab of CL Unscented salve on my neck\n\nI couldn't wait to try out my new found and cleaned up super speed. I had read its a mild razor and found that to be semi true. It's not as mild as the slim on 1 which is just about perfect for me and it's nowhere near as mild as the Karve. It's definitely still usable, even for me, though I did nick myself shaving under my nose ATG. It's more aggressive than I'd prefer to use regularly but with its size it would make a perfect travel razor. Honestly the size and weight is like perfect. Its pretty light and I love the handle length. I just wish it was a little more mild, but maybe that means I just need to hunt for a blue tip super speed now. Oh the rabbit hole I've started with vintage razors now..\n\nThis was the first time I haven't used a Barrister & Mann soap in weeks. I've basically been rotating fern and Seville for like the past month and haven't had an issue with that. Tonight I wanted to go back to a soap I hadn't used in awhile to compare. For starters, I overloaded the holy fuck out of it. I've gotten so use to using badgers that I forgot how quick you can load a synthetic. Took me forever to dial in and get properly hydrated. When I was I was rewarded with a very shiny yogurty lather. Lather - on point. Slickness - definitely not on par with reserve or glissant, in my opinion. I've never been able to get a real slick lather with this soap like I can with B&M or Dec bison tallow. The post shave is tits but I personally care about slickness more and that's where this base lacks for me to not make it top 3. The scent on this is great and is a dead ringer for brut aftershave. I'll most definitely continue to recommend WKDM as always and it's still in my top 5. I just wish it was a little slicker for me.\n\nI found out Tuesday my neighbor passed away like a week ago and today is his funeral. I'm going sans wife to pay my respects. I feel a little awkward going solo since I don't know anyone else there but I feel like if I don't go I'll regret it. His wife came by to let us know of his passing and also to invite us to the funeral Tuesday evening. It kinda fucked me up because I had no idea it happened and now I can't stop thinking about the last time I saw him and what I wished I would have said. We weren't real close, he's an older gentleman but always talked in passing and I'd go by to help them whenever they needed it as they're an older couple. Life is strange, it's unfortunate we rarely ever know the last time we will see someone.\n\nI guess this is my journal now? Lol well anyway, if you're still here, work sucks & happy baby Friday folks!\n\nEdit: Shit, lather games started and I had no idea. If I had a desert island shave it would definitely be... B&M Reserve Seville. My Karve w/ A plate. Feather blade. B5 Washington.",

Scent wise, I'd have to go with 42 I because it's such a well-balanced mix of everything. But if I went with 42 on a desert island, I'd be longing for the Declaration bison tallow base eventually.\n\nPlus, the Declaration alcohol splash stings more.

Why'd I pick this? It's quite simple, two of the most iconic scents in all of shaving. Any wet shaver would be remiss not to remember the humble beginnings we came from -- further, I'm not sure there's a wet shaver alive who's not smelled both ~~Barbersoul~~ ([CaD](https://www.italianbarber.com/products/phoenix-artisan-accoutrements-shaving-soap-cad) that ish, man) Barbasol and Old Spice. So, while iconic, are these *really* my two favorite scents, amounting to my most favorite set up?? Really? PAA?? [Of course](https://youtu.be/QOKociU8t_Q?t=6s)...[NOT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhIdbRp6xeg).\n\nOk, so why did I really pick this and how does it actually fit the theme, you ask? Well it should be obvious given a Desert Island theme. Track with me - look at [this](https://trythatsoap.s3.amazonaws.com/paa_cad_soap.jpg). Look past Cap'n Douche and you can see it's a boat, in a (get this) desert. How do you get to islands? In boats. Ever seen a boat in a desert? I haven't, but I seen plenty on islands. So there you have it, it was the only soap I could think of that actually depicted a Desert Island (I was going to double up and throw something in here about [dessert storm](https://www.reddit.com/r/wicked_edge/comments/2l9sdk/can_someone_explain_the_scandal_with_htgamppf/cm4lfkr/) but I think that's a tale for another day). And I want to make sure I stay on that there desert island, so I brought my [anchor](https://i.imgur.com/AlGwcus.jpg) with me. And here I had y'all convinced that Barbasol and Old Spice should somehow be remembered fondly and revered forever.

At first I figured it was a novelty scent. Something to use at the beach or something like that. After four or five uses I could see wanting to have a coconut scent in your den for more than just that. I used a tad too much water this time. Forgot I was using my synthetic for a second.\n\nNot much is happening on my end. Playing Final Fantasy XIV and going to the gym.\n\nHope everyone has a good day.",

For the razor I asked her what she wanted me to use knowing that she doesn't know all their names. She half assed mumbled something about a 1920's raised flat bottom. She was just messing around but after she correctly named a razor in my collection I just had to use it! So, this proves that she does half listen to my ramblings about all this stuff I have.\n\n",

This one is an amazing scent, having an old leather scent in the tub which darkly blossoms into a sort of dark aquatic when lathered. I got a bit of moss, some earth, and a lot of ozone, with some marine notes. Reminded me of a darker Bulgari \"Aqva\" with ozonic and leather notes.\n\n* Performance wise, the SW base was very good, in the same ballpark as Dr Jons and Caties Bubbles. Lathered very easily and copiously, a rare and good thing from a sample! The main appeal here though is the utterly strange and unique scent. Rather like \"Fougere Gothique\", this is a polarizing scent that hits its theme very faithfully and as a result is not that accessible to the less adventurous.\n\n* Cthulhu is supposed to be a dragon / octopus with cosmic powers who lives in a dank ruined city beneath the sea. AA paints a great scent picture of that whole concept - I was very impressed! But if you like pretty flowers and mild citrus, you may want to sit this one out...",

I did try a sample first and loved it!! The aftershave made it even better. I have a feeling this is one of the first ones I'll reach for again 30 days from now. Such a clean scent, awesome for summer.\n\nI am going to also try something new and use a different razor for each of the 31 days. I'm looking forward to this as much as the soaps. I havent used several in a long time and a few I have been saving for a special occasion. Todays razor/brush is not one of those. This is my favorite setup, both custom made by Dogwood and a fixture in my rotation.",

I was also several months in to soap making. I could make a pretty good shaving soap, but it wasn't there yet. I had dreams of opening a soap making business, but didn't think I'd actually do it. Limping through the Lather Games and completing 20ish days I think was the first time that I felt comfortable posting frequently in this sub, and helped me realize that you guys aren't THAT scary. I choose Teacher's Pet for today because when I began scent creation last summer this was the first scent I created that made me realize that I could actually do this. Those are 2 things that stand out from my first year in this hobby, but the 3rd is you guys. I never in a million years could have or would have opened Summer Break Soaps without your support and feedback. Being part of this community gave me the confidence to do something I've never done before, and I've loved every second of it. I cannot thank you all enough. I came to wetshaving as a way to save money and ended up with 2 hobbies and a business.\n\nUnique Soaps: 1.\nUnique Aftershaves: 1.\nUnique Razors: 1.\nUnique Brushes 1.\n\nEdit: Wow, my first gold! Thank you anonymous wet shaving individual!",

It's so bad it actually makes me angry. It's so bad that I start having an existential crisis when I smell Tabac -- why does evil exist? why would someone put this on their face on purpose? if someone really likes this, how much can we really have in common at a foundational, human level? is any of this real? what is consciousness? does consciousness even need a body to exist? am I just a brain in a vat in some laboratory and is Tabac simply a trick that my brain-vatted overlords are just playing on me as a cruel experiment on my helpless free-floating vat brain?\n\nBut if I were stranded on a desert island, this would be what I would take with me. Mainly, because if I were stranded on a desert island, I would want to get the hell off the island and back into civilization. I'm not cut out for that desert island life -- mosquitoes, wildlife, having to butcher your own meat, free-climbing trees to harvest coconuts, building my own hut/wrestling a wild creature and taking over his cave.\n\nNope.\n\nI need to get off this island, stat. And I really think that the idea of shaving with Tabac for the rest of my life would ground me, motivate me, activate my fight or flight response, snap me out of talking to my volleyball named Wilson, and force me to start building a raft out of driftwood and a sections of a salvaged portapotty, and get the hell off this island or die trying.",

This is a new razor for me, but it's absolutely the best shave I've ever had. What can I say about the Tuxedo knot, Astra SPs and Thayer's witch hazel that hasn't already been said. Even on the most desolate deserted island, these products would keep me sane.\n\nI'm excited to start my first lather games. Unfortunately I know I cannot complete all 32 days.

The scent is unique (compared to the other scents I have) and the performance is awesome. I just love the way my face feels after a shave with this stuff. I went with this particular Tech because it was my first \"in the wild\" find, and it's mild and efficient in a way that usually works great for me. I'm still working through a blade sampler, so the blade was a crap shoot, but holy shit the Platinum Lux may be my new favorite. Not quite BBS, but damn close and with next to no irritation. I'll probably keep the razor and blade the same for the next couple of days and see what happens.",

This year I am going to just chill and play when I can. Lavanille was the first soap I got way back in the day that blew me away in terms of complexity. It got me on the B&M train pretty early on. It's an older tub and I have issues using soaps I really enjoy. The SOC Badger was one of my first badgers. Sure badger trends made brushes get bigger and more dense. This is honestly a perfect size and isn't too dense and doesn't hog. Perfect for the island. My V3A/Polsilver is perfect. Sure I have other SS and Alum razors but honestly it still beats the others aggressive de's out.\n\nEdit: Didn't read formatting directions",

But considering balance, ease of use, familiarity etc. it has to be 34C for me.\n\nSoap, I would say my favorite soap scent is a toss up between Seville and AoS Sandalwood, with Seville winning 55% of the time. But since we have a B&M day coming up, I decided to use this one. I marginally prefer the scent of the cream than the soap but soap performs noticeably better.\n\nFinally, AoS balms have always been great to me.\n\nUnique Lather Count: 1/1\n\nUnique Brand(lather) Count: 1/1",

Great shave today a few small nicks around the corners of my mouth but overall very smooth and comfortable. The splash went on with a fervor and was turning my cheeks red, but rubbing in just a touch of the salve helped with that immensely and I like the silky feeling left on my face.

      "body": "L A T H E R G A M E S\n\nDesert Island Day\n\n\n- Day 1, I washed up on what appears to be a desert island with nothing but a shave kit that includes Executive Man from Stirling. Of all the necessary items, this one is obviously at the top. And who could ever get tired of using that setup every day.\n\n- Day 3, I've grown tired of Executive Man after my third straight use. If only there was a TJ Maxx around to help quench my thirst for top-tier shaving options. Luckily I've found some shelter and have begun to eat some coconut after finally cracking a few open.\n\n- Day 12, I quit shaving on day 4. Why on earth would I continue to do that? I'm stranded on an island. No mirror. No other humans to care what I look like. And these coconuts are looking mighty fine right now (google Reddit coconut).\n\n- Day 15, I couldn't live with myself after my coconut debacle. Just waves of shame crashing over my body, which now is starting to resemble that of Tom Hanks from Castaway.\n\n- Day 16, I venture inland in search of other types of food and shelter and I stumble upon, yes, a hatch. WTF is a hatch doing on this island? I knock on it and to my great surprise a man pops out. \"Suglas D'Mythe is the name, welcome to my island.\" \"WTF kind of name is Suglas?\" I ask myself. Also stranded on the island, this mustachioed freak show apparently made soap inside his hatch as a hobby during this apparent self-imposed solitude...making something he called Artisan Accoutrements in Purgatory (AAP for short). His theme was all over the map, but it seemed to revolve around the fact that he was in his own little world here on the island. So, Sug invited me in and I quickly felt like something was off. Perhaps he was conning me with tales of the mainland and how he arrived on the island. I didn't know for sure, but I had to get out of that hatch and get off this island, less I also go crazy.\n\n- Day 24, I managed to actually get kicked out of the hatch without much effort. While showing me around and introducing me to his AAP setup I inadvertently dropped a tub of his soap into his makeshift toilet and he became enraged. Probably for the best. But, my outlook remains weary as food and shelter are harder to find now that I'm back in the wilderness.\n\n- Day 26, Haven't eaten since leaving the hatch. I constantly think about dying. Please grant me my sweet release.\n\n- Day 27, I've made my way back to shore. There's the coconut remains. The old Executive Man kit. And mostly sadness. I find myself staring at the sea most of my days now as I count the hours before death. The hours go by and the abyss truly stares right back into you.\n\n- Day 30, nearing death I'm woken up by a sound. One that sounds familiar. It's a ship. But, is it friend or foe? I read the side of the ship and see \"S.S. Icarus,\" which has me elated as I know better days are ahead of me and I'll be saved.\n\nEl fin.\n\n- Prep: Shower\n- Pre: None\n- Razor: Charcoal Goods Hammered Stainless Level 2\n- Blade: Astra Green (2)\n- Brush: Stirling Finest Badger Iridescent Marble 24mm\n**- Lather:** Stirling-Executive Man\n- Post: Stirling-Executive Man AS & Balm\n- Frag: Creed Aventus\n\n- Soaps used: 1/32\n- Soap Brands: 1/32\n- Aftershaves used: 1/32\n- Razors: 1/7\n- Brushes: 1/7",

You see, I am a man of eclectic and specific taste. I don't want 100 cars, I want one car that I love. I don't want 500 soaps, I want one soap. I want to eat Indian food every day for the rest of my life and I've listened to the same music since I was 14. Decision fatigue is a real thing and I am not immune to it.\n\nI've worn more or less the same shoes since freshman year of high school. My uptight corporate office relaxed the dress code in recent years, so I could wear my signature [Chuck Taylor blue high tops](https://images.nike.com/is/image/DotCom/PDP_HERO/159620F_483_A_PREM/converse-chuck-taylor-all-star-seasonal-high-top-unisex-shoe.jpg) instead of dress shoes. I get a lot of compliments on them, particularly from the mid-40's lonely office housewives. The only problem is, they make me very recognizable.\n\nYou see, I am the kind of guy who, after working myriad minimum wage jobs in high school and college, relishes getting paid to shit. I save all my poops up (which are legion, due to the aforementioned Indian food diet) and unload at work. I'd estimate the amount of money I've earned while on the pot at the high end of 5 figures.\n\nThis brings me back to the shoes. I pay attention to the clothes other people wear because your fashion choices say a lot about you. And if you're rocking the single most identifiable pair of shoes in the office, you quickly earn a reputation as the guy who poops more than he works. So what do you do: walk into the bathroom with your head held high and show off your kicks for the world to see, risking your job and livelihood?\n\nI say no. Shit barefoot.",

If you asked me just a few months ago I probably would have said Leviathan or something else dark, weird, and mysterious. The kind of fragrance that makes people passing by get a whiff and say, \"Not only does that guy fuck, but he smokes a pack of Marlboro Reds, curls a 100lb dumbbell, and watches the opening battle scene of 1981's [*Excalibur*](https://youtu.be/XxSeeN03Xfg?t=1m49s) on repeat while doing it.\"\n\nBut no... Cheshire is my desert island shave.\n\nBecause whether I like it or not, I have to accept the fact that--deep down--I'm a basic bitch that likes citrus and floral scents with a hint of Earl Grey tea.\n\nI probably drink cold-pressed juice and listen to Taylor Swift, too, because I'm a dirty fraud.\n\n_______________________________________________________\n\n- Lathers completed: 1/32\n- Unique Soaps: 1/32\n- Unique Brands/Artisans: 1/32",

Yeah I like shaving as much as the next soap tub sniffing weirdo. But, when shit is going down, you gotta prioritize.\n\nI mean, first off - if you get rescued and you're all baby faced smooth, smelling of bergamot and jasmine, ain't nobody gonna believe your busted ass stranded-island-story. Your old lady is gonna think you ran off with your other family, in Cincinnati... again.\n\nRemember kids: beards save marriages.\n\nBut that's **IF** you make it off the island to get nagged at by your wife for \"running to the store real quick to get bread and baby formula... but that was six months ago... Where the hell have you been... HOW THE HELL DID YOU END UP ON AN ISLAND YOU NO-GOOD-LYING SORRY EXCUSE FOR A MAN?!?!\"\n\nMate, you got bigger stuff to worry about right now: food, water, shelter.... companionship. It's been a few years since I saw *Cast Away*, but if I remember right you can drink coconut milk and eat the pulp, and it'll get you by for a while. You can probably even use the husk to tie some driftwood together for shelter. Coconut is looking like a magic pill right about now, isn't it?\n\nBut slow your roll, playa - ain't nobody got the stones to bang a coconut, no matter how lonely you get. Once your basic needs are met: food, water, shelter, it's time to move into those baser needs. You ever tried to break open a coconut? Stronger than a human skull, son. Dem nuts ain't gonna solve all your problems. And don't forget, we're on a *desert* island too. Sand is the mortal enemy of intimacy.\n\nSo I'm thinking... as my boat is sinking; imma empty out my dopp bag. Pour out all my wonderful soaps, and beautiful straights, jars of splash; all that sexy - right on the deck, next to that [brave trio of gentlemen](https://youtu.be/qb5P0WWhE3g). I'll drop a $20 in their tip jar and load that bag up with jergens and kleenex. And if fate is on my side, I might even find a fleshlight that fortuitously fell from a piece of luggage as it was carelessly cast aside on the Carnival deck, lost in the fervor and clamour for the life boats. Now I'm set for survival on this island.\n\nBut I had to shave with something today. So I grabbed *Fair Isle Harbor*. It's not great. But it smells kinda tropicalish, and it shares almost half of an entire word from the day's theme. It doesn't have a dude on a boat in a desert, but I'm cool with that. I got a bag full of supplies for this desert vacation, and I'm growing the Rip Van Winkle of all cover story beards. [Wilson](https://lazyop.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/4006488-wilson.jpg) is a down af wingman too. He'll back my alibi.\n\n____\nDays completed: 1 of 1\nUnique soaps used: 1\nUnique artisans: 1\n\n\n\nedit: typo",

I only have a couple brushes and razors so will be using them a lot.\n\nI decided to go with a soap I enjoy, though I do find it quite overpriced so don't use it very often. Running 70 bucks for a small tub, I think there are better options out there. The shave was nice. I got a strong almond/cherry scent off the cream but that faded quickly. The balm was nice, the best part being the scent. It reminds me quite a bit like Cella and XXX.\n\nXPEC and MdC I also find nice. I won't be using them during the month thought they were close calls.

Did a 5 second dry load and a 30 second load after adding 1/4 tsp water. Wasn't as thick as longer load times, but was great for a quick load of soap if you're in a hurry. Didn't get that nasty bubbly, airy foam either.\n\nHadn't tried the Nacet in the Grande yet, and it was a very good combo for me as well. Has become one of my favorite blades.\n\nThis is a young SOC brush, with just 11 uses or so, and it continues to impress.\n\nWife loved the Special Reserve today! Woot!",

The pre-shave oil because it's just nice. I almost went for my 620 but the 830 just edged it out. The Super Adjustable besides the fact that it's my birth year razor, but it's all around great. The Personna blade because it's super smooth. Now we're getting to the meat of it. If I had it right now, and it was the only one I could use forever, is actually Tabac. But, since I'm out of that, Stirling Barbershop is a very close second, and so it gets the nod. Yes, the scents are quite different, but they're both fantastic. Finishing off with Reserve Cool because I also love that scent. Why didn't I choose Reserve Cool soap? Because scent variety.\n\nWell, it's late and I'm nodding off as type this, so I don't know how many typos there are. I also don't know how much I can actually participate. We'll see...",
