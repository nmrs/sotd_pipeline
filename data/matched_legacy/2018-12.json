And my first time working with Reserve Cool soap (loved it).\n\nAlso used Stubble Buster AS after a shave, and its menthol was at a level the same as many, but was too much for me. I can use it at other times during the day, though. My wife likes this scent.\n\n## Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(RazoRock - Mamba ::: Gillette - Silver Blue ‹10 uses›)*\n\nVery good combo with this 10th use GSB blade. No tugging or irritation. Nice smooth shave. I can see why people like this one. Not much in terms of blade feel; it was more that I just felt the hairs being cut. Would like to put a Feather or Kai in here and see how that would go.\n\n## Soap Notes\n*^(Barrister n Mann - Reserve Cool)*\n\nWonderful soap! I'm a big Reserve fan.\n\n20 sec load gave me the perfect amount of soap. Around 1 tsp of water, combined with the medium wet brush at the beginning gave me a well-hydrated, slick soap that worked well. For creamy purposes, I would not go more thin than this.\n\nFelt so good and slick rinsing this soap off between passes!\n\nScent strength: 5/10, right in my sweet spot. Very present during the shave, but not bothersome at all. I really like this scent and am so glad that Barrister and Mann put this in the Reserve line to bring back such a wonderful scent profile.\n\n\n## Brush Notes\n*^(Declaration Grooming - B5 24mm Badger Blue Handle)*\n\nReduced the choke on the knot to just one thick rubber band. Really liked the result. Just enough splay. I think I know enough to get an O-ring now that will work well. Very happy with the feel!\n\n## Shave Quality\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Smooth\n*Neck*: Smooth\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Few hairs are showing some tip length (with most being cut flush)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm)\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

I completely forgot I had it, so it was the perfect time to lather it up on this gloomy morning that will turn into about a half inch of freezing rain later in.\n\nI still love the scent; to me it brings me back to childhood. Early on, we had a gas stove, and my mother used to turn the flame to minimum and balance orange peels over the heat. Santa Paula smells like those roasting orange peels. In retrospect, burning orange peels was a *huge* safety issue, but so was no seatbelts and Lawn Darts, and we survived ;-)\n\nOddly enough, that's not the inspiration for today's SOTD title (but it could be). I like my coffee black and extremely strong, but detest dark roast charred coffee like most Starbucks. A friend at work gifted me some [Death Wish Coffee](https://www.deathwishcoffee.com/) from Saratoga Springs, NY - I'm having their [Valhalla Java - Odinforce Blend](https://www.deathwishcoffee.com/products/5-pound-bag-valhalla-java) and I'm in love.

I ordered this set and one other scent (I'm a sucker for the juniper scent so had to snag that one as well).\n\nThis lightly mentholated and smells great. A great winter shave.\n\nThe soap lathers like a champ and performs well. Just don't be shy with the water. IMO, the post shave feel truly rivals Chatillion Lux. It's that good.\n\nDefinitely recommend if it fits your budget (roughly $50 per soap/aftershave set).",

I am not sure if Peter Charkalis makes his own soap base or if he contracts it out, but damn, this base is fantastic. Really easy to whip up a top-notch lather. *Asian Plum* is a unique scent that is very relaxing. A fruity-floral scent that also has a touch of coffee, vanilla, tonka bean, etc. It is a decent match with another fruity-floral scent, *1803*.\n\nI woke up at 4:00 AM to take my daughter and her boyfriend to the airport this morning.

It showed up a couple days ago and I finally got around to it this morning. Scent off the puck was light, citrusy, and pleasant. It did open up somewhat when lathering but it was hard to pay attention to because I had a 7-year old helper narrating the \"face painting\" and telling me that shaving looked like it would hurt. Also, I realized after I finished shaving that I totally missed u/phteven_j's brush drop (those Andromedas are sweet).\n\nOn Wednesday night, we brought doggo home from the animal hospital. We also got into a car accident (nobody got hurt) that left our aging primary family car in a pretty sorry state. I managed to get it home, but it is in no fit state for continued use. So for the last few days, we've been working on doggo rehab (he's able to \"walk\" (still usually dragging one back leg or the other) all the way across the living room now, which is a huge improvement) and shopping for a new primary family car. Today, we're supposed to sell our wrecked car and go to Carmax to get a replacement. *sigh* I am so ready to be done with this frakking week.",

I must say, Sellout smells even better to me than Executive Man. Scott really did an awesome job with this. While I've never actually smelled the famed Creed Aventus, I can tell you that Sellout smells wonderful. I had no issues with the soap, but strangely the aftershave caused a mild to moderate burning sensation that lasted for a couple of minutes as well as some slight redness. This has never happened to me with any aftershave including the two from Declaration that I have used multiple times. Jonesing for a refresh of the scent and curious about the burning sensation, I reapplied more aftershave about thirty minutes later, and it still happened although not as intensely. I'll have to see if it occurs the next time I use it. I really don't want to let go of this one.",

Muchas gracias to my Secret Santa, who gifted a Sellout set (soap + AS + light hold pomade) and a Declaration brush! This reminds me of how fortunate and *lucky* I am, and more importantly in the big picture- knowing what is going on in all parts of the world. A fitting sentiment of gratitude and PIF, quite appropriate for this holiday season.\n\nAs for the shave: Sellout smells fantastic, every bit the shmaventus type one would expect, and with the excellent performance we know from the Icarus base. After reading up on Scoot's Brush FAQ on his website, I used the new Washo to lather up; the brush felt great in the hand, and the bristles softened up after a short soak in warm water. Looks like this one'll have gel tips after it's broken in (fingers crossed). All in all a great shave, and one that has reminded me of how much I am thankful for.\n\nI used the whole set last night and today, which came in handy for a classy charity event I had to attend with my wife. Not sure if we won anything in the silent auction, but I felt great looking and smelling like a million bucks.",

It got soft on the surface and even though I left it open for a few days it didn't firm up. It has been nearly a year sinc I used it. It caught my eye and I thought I was just going to pitch it. I opened it up and noticed that it was still soft in the surface but not nearly as much as it had been. I gave it a shot and I'm glad I did. It's a pretty decent soap. It obviously loaded easily, and lathered quickly. I think I will use it a few more times in the coming days to see if it starts to soften up again.",

After reloading a bit of soap the lather was perfect though and then the shave was very great.\n\nIt's the first time I use this AS balm and I'm very satisfied of it, the scent might be a little too strong imo, or maybe it's just that the scent itself is not for me. However as an aftershave the product is very great. It just lays a thin layer on your skin that is protective and soothing enough for a biker to wear a helmet right after shaving (and THAT is a very good point to me). 10/10 would use again.\n\nLast week I ordered a few samples that I'm very impatient to try, such as B&M Vespers, Reserve Waves & Cool (only soaps) and NO thé noir et vanille (soap and AS splash). As an european I'll probably receive it during the week.\n\nHave a great shave y'all !",

I realized last night that it smells very similar to NO Lonestar, which I also really like. Although I look at the scent profiles and they only lemon is shared between them. For those curious: Evocative scents include cinnamon, vanilla, heliotrope, tonka bean, sandalwood, orange blossom, jasmine, patchouli, cardamom, lily of the valley, mandarin, lemon, and bergamot. Lonestar contains: Cedar, leather, lemon, oakmoss, sage, magnolia, and hay. It's tough for me to pick a favorite, they are so similar and so good in my opinion.\n\nGiving platelets this morning and watching some football this afternoon. Go Browns!\n\nGreat shaves, all.",

I'm glad to get back to an old favorite. I love the scent and performance.\n\n## Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Wolfman - WR1 Open Comb .61 Polished ::: PolSilver ‹9 uses›)*\n\nI might have to do my next shave with the Gillette silver blue in this head because I believe it was more comfortable and smooth . But this one was no slouch.\n\nNo tugging, no irritation.\n\n## Soap Notes\n*^(Cella)*\n\nTry 1/8 tsp or so next time. 1/4 tsp gave me 3x as much lather as I needed. But today it looked hot!\n\nWonderfully slick and protective. Scent was great and about 4-5/10 for strength. Nice and present during shave.\n\n\n## Brush Notes\n*^(Declaration Grooming - B5 24mm Badger Blue Handle)*\n\nVery happy with a little choking up on this knot (current handle may give it too high a loft) to lower the loft just a little bit.\n\n## Shave Quality\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Few hairs are showing some tip length (with most being cut flush)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm)\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

Four toners and a bunch of EdT samples. Working them into my shaves now. Shawn's scents are so complex, in a good way. I'm still trying to wrap my head around this one, but I like it so far. Reserve base lather + CL toner aftershave is great for the skin. Happy Sunday shaves, all!",

I went to Maggard's yesterday and picked up the Soap and AS of this as well as Southern Witchcraft Druantia but used this today because of this strange warm day we have. I used my dad's Ghost Town Barber EdP to finish off my SOTD. I'm definitely happy he has this one because it really completes the shave and the scent.\n\nOn the actual shave front, I still struggle to find a blade I like in this particular razor. I use a Feather in my Tech, but it doesn't agree with my face in the Superspeed. I am definitely open to any suggestions people have of what blades they like in Superspeeds, because none of my usual suspects are cutting it for me.\n\nHave a good one, everyone!",

Also, since yesterday was razor cleaning day, the AS-D2 is nice and shiny in the picture. I think the GSB blade is running out of steam now that it's done 8 shaves. Totally respectable run for a $0.248 blade (price was high because I only bought 25 of them) coming out to $0.031 per shave. I'm not a huge fan of the Black Dragon. It's totally fine, but vetiver's not my favorite and I wouldn't generally reach for it unless it was to fit a theme. However, it paired quite nicely with the Delor de Treget. This was my first time using one of Chatty Lux's toners and I'm pretty happy with the result. Not only does it have that wonderful DdT scent, but the flesh of my dome is soft, supple, and moisturized without being oily or greasy.\n\nBig day yesterday. In addition to cleaning a couple razors, we went to CarMax to swap out the busted car (accident bent the frame, totally called that one) for a non-busted car. That took 3 hours. Then we drove down to Safeco Field for the big holiday thingy called \"Enchant\". They had a big Christmas maze and an ice skating path and lots of vendors. I ended up spending a fair portion of the time sitting in probably the best seat I'll ever sit in at Safeco field (front row right at first base) because I'm in the middle of a [gout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gout) flare up and there was no way I was getting my swollen foot in an ice skate.\n\nProbably going to spend today taking it easy and keeping my foot up.",

I typically keep the 'stache around until January 1, but this year I decided to remove it...mostly. Rather than shave the whole thing, I kept the 'mustache' part of my growth. I figured, 'why not?'.\n\nIt has been some time since I've visited the S2. I brought it on a week long road trip but my blades never arrived to my destination, so I just didn't shave. The work aspect didn't matter if I shaved or not, and I didn't really care either. I checked a grocery store and a drug store for blades, but no avail. Whatevs!\nAnyhow, it's just as smooth or smoother than I remember, and this is removing a great amount of facial hair. I stand my my assertion that the S2 is a fantastic shaver. Works great for heavy growth or for daily usage. Not hard to get, and can be found for around a c note if you look.\n\nDFS and it's gorgeous out today post rain! HELL YEAH!!!\n\nHope everyone's weekend has been enjoyable.",

Went decently. First time using a feather blade, and I went into it apprehensively, but came out really really pleased with the way it felt. I had my beard shaved off with a straight razor by a barber on Friday night, and came out of it a little disappointed. I told him that the hair on my neck grows south to north so he could go with the grain to start. Well, he didn't really heed my advice, and I have some decent irritation on my neck that has carried over until today. Kinda frustrating, but oh well. So it goes. It'll get better. Still love DG's after the rain. Bummed that it is out of stock literally everywhere right now, as I would really like a tub of it.\n\nHappy Shaves Y'all!",

I smelled it a long time ago and remembered really enjoying the smell. He was kind enough to give me some, and I appreciate it. Great shave all around, both in terms of smell and performance. It's a slick performer. Back to the grind.....",

It's hard to believe that this was the standard size for CB back in the day. I will never get through this tub. And since it will outlast me, I overloaded the hell out of it. The Arko man had nothing on me today.\n\nSomething about this brush has gotten me more interested in it lately. A while back I put an o-ring at the base of the knot to reign it in and that went a long way in making it more appealing to me. But even considering that, I have grown to like it a lot more than I expected in the past couple of months. Wierd.",

The brush is also lofted high so that contributes to huge amounts of splay and very little backbone, just for me a combo that is less than pleasurable to use.\n\nHave a nice Monday everyone!",

Not much to say but just a good arrangement of great scents. The amount of Latha Lavanda I have, will probably make it to the grave with me but it is an amazingly good lavender scent for the price.\n\nHappy Monday!",

It's been a while. I recalled the R4 plate to be more efficient but a somewhat harsher shave. I don't know why now, since it mowed down a solid 4 days of growth without any tugging or roughness. Maybe I committed to the R3 plate too soon? This was the best shave I've had in a while, no doubt in part due to the software. But I think the plate made a huge difference here. Basically a BBS without any real effort or blood.",

According to Stirling's FB post, some have previously likened the scent of Bonaparte to \"grandma's farts\" or \"fruity toe jam\". I don't see (or smell) any of that. It's a very grapefruit-forward scent that begins to meld away into a musky fruit kind of like if you took a massive bowl of fruit loops and sprinkled a bit of Jovan Musk into it before filling the bowl with water, giving it a good shake, and then splashing said amalgamation onto my face. I know that musk isn't a listed scent note but that's what my weird ass nose is getting from it. The craziest part is that I actually kinda like it. I think. It's gotta pass the wife test when I pop my head into the bakery she's at on my way to work. We shall see I suppose. But if it's up to me, I do believe I'll be visiting this scent every so often. It's nice for a change of pace.",

I realized that I don't own any Sandalwood aftershave since I finished Santal Auster salve. Fine aftershave just doesn't agree with my skin, and Stirling sandalwood lights my face up. Does anyone know of any good sandalwood balms similar to the Fine one that doesn't burn the skin?",

I went ahead and got all three samples from the new Druantia line as it's something that I've been excited to try for a while.\n\nIf I had to describe the scent, I'd say that it's complex, but familiar. It has a very similar DNA to the Arcane Abyss line, but it's definitely well suited to colder weather. It has a deep spicy quality that replaces the aquatic vibe you get with Arcane Abyss.\n\nAll in all, I'd highly recommend this one. It's a vegan soap that shaves better than most tallow-based soaps and the fragrance is complex, but comforting.\n",

      "body": "***December 3, 2018***\n\n* **Soap:** Barrister and Mann Vespers\n* **Brush:** 22mm Maggard black synth / Vie Long barber handle\n* **Razor:** Blackland Blackbird SB - machined\n* **Blade:** Astra SP (2)\n* **Post:** Thayer's Medicated WH / Barrister and Mann Beaudelaire\n\nI finally broke out my Vespers sample and used it for the first time today and it was a glorious shave to knock down 2 days of growth. I was on the fence about the scent just sniffing it from the jar, but once lathered it may have become a must buy. Sure, out of the jar it's a very nice scent that does have a very seasonal/holiday vibe to it, but I couldn't pick up a whole lot of that delicious Mousse de Saxe that I love in Beaudelaire. As soon as a wet brush hits it though, that's when the magic happens for me. The MdS comes out and blends with all of the other wonderful scents in this mix and becomes an instant favorite. Upon first use, I didn't really notice a striking difference in performance between this and say Reserve, but I'm sure I'll be able to discover that more when I get some more shaves in with Excelsior.\n\n​\n\nRegarding the Blackbird, this was my second shave with it and I can say without a doubt that this thing is a BBS machine. I used a steep angle and it just effortlessly mowed down 2 days of growth with no nicks or irritation whatsoever. 2 passes and zero touch ups yielded a super smooth BBS, even on my typical \"trouble spots\" below the chin and on my neck. This shave was so good I'm going to use the same setup tomorrow. Good shaves and happy Monday all!\n\n​\n\n​",

Excellent shave. No tugging or irritation. Felt the blade, but was very controlled and comfy.\n\n## Soap Notes\n*^(Barrister and Mann - Reserve Wavy-Spice)*\n\nMixing half and half Waves and Spice.\n\nMy hope is that the aquatics in Waves help out the Spice, and the spices in Spice overwhelm the florals in Waves.\n\nUnfortunately, the florals were too strong, and the aquatics too weak. Definitely fun to try.\n\nTons of lather. More than a 1/4 tsp of soap + lightly wet brush + I think 2tsp of water = almost twice as much as I needed.\n\nAs usual, with Reserve, the slickness is off the charts, and face felt super afterwards.\n\n\n## Brush Notes\n*^(Romero - Manchurian 26mm w Love Your Shave Handle)*\n\nA great brush today.\n\n## Shave Quality\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Few hairs are showing some tip length (with most being cut flush)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm)\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

Not sure, but it works for me and that's all that matters\n\nEdit: blades are kind of important too",

Only was able to get the splash, which is a bummer because I really enjoy the scent. It's very woodsy, and the scent changes quite a bit once it's dried.\n\nFirst time using Stirling's Coniferous as well, which I liked. I love the smell of pine, fir, evergreen, etc. and this smelled like I was rubbing a pine cone on my face, in the best possible way.\n\nThe splash performance was similar to my first experience with THB yesterday (sandalwood smoke). Some initial tightness, followed by a great feeling face.\n\nAlso my first time using a Wilkinson Sword blade. It was okay. A small patch of irritation, and my face is not as smooth as I get with my GBSs. I'll give it another couple shaves, but it's not looking very likely to unseat GSBs for me.",

I can't recall if this was in their v1 or v2 base but either way, the scent didn't work for me. It was well done though; if Chiseled Face Trade Winds is a pirate ship at sea, Arcane Abyss is the shipwreck 400 years later.\n\nMe and /u/steelersroc86 did a blind box trade some time ago and in it was a sample of Necromantic. Admittedly, I never tried it because as soon as I smelled it, I knew I had to have a set. (I'll save the sample to throw in with a lot or a PIF or something.) I had been curious about this scent ever since /u/jimtasticness started using it. I don't know why but I vividly remember a comment he made about it: \"I can't tell where Necromantic starts and Jim ends!\" It piqued my curiosity. I put it on my wish list for the Secret Santa exchange.\n\nAnd boy did my Secret Santa come through! I got this Necromantic set in the mail the other day (along with a puck of Lime Conk, yeah, fight me) and I was so thrilled to open up this set. I stuck my honker in the tub and inhaled and this scent is just...intoxicating. I want the bath bar too, I want my whole damn self to smell like this. I'm sitting here at my desk with the tub open in front of me and unfortunately, my nose has all the sophistication of a caveman. I can't really pick out individual notes but per the [website,](http://www.southernwitchcrafts.com/product/nekromantik-vegan-shave-soap/) they are rose, wisteria, honey, red wine, dirt, and ozone. It's very well blended. And performance wise, /u/phteven_j, this is hands-down the best vegan soap I've ever used. If I didn't know for a fact that it was vegan, I wouldn't guess it. The residual slickness is especially impressive, my face was slippery as goose shit (but smelled WAAAAAAAY better.) I will absolutely be purchasing the EdP for this set, which is only the second time I've felt compelled to complete a set with the frag. (The other being Seville in Reserve.)\n\nHuge thanks to my Secret Santa! That smooth, beautiful bastard really hit a home run (read: dinger) with this box. THANK YOU SO MUCH!\n\n*Regarding the song:* I don't really get into music like this but it's okay. I'm mostly linking for purposes of the music video. This is easily one of the strangest and most unsettling videos I've ever seen. A bit long at 6 mins, but watch this shit if you get a minute. Or six.\n\n8 hours of classroom training today. Fuck work.",

This isn't the best soap I have, but it is one of the best values available. A quality soap in a 5.25oz hard milled puck. This would be a good choice for someone that doesn't want a lot of soaps and who doesn't want to break the bank. I estimate that I have ~30-40 shaves on this puck and I have barely put a dent in the top of it.\n\nOff to do it.",

I was getting used to the 3.5\" as it brought the length of the CB to that of the Rockwell 6S which suits my hand nicely. I found that it was still slightly heavier that I like and caused me to apply undue pressure on cross grain and ATG passes. The 3.25\" is the perfect weight. Although I have just been doing single pass shaves, this one felt better than the past couple of days. Maybe the handle, maybe the fresh blade, maybe the excelsior. Who knows. I've seen everyone trying to describe Vespers with so many words. Vespers makes me happy. Thanks, Will.\n",

It has been over a year and half and this is my first crack at it the brand. Was it a decent shave? Absolutely, the lather was fine, the scent was pleasant and the feel was good. Would I be happy had I never used anything top tier? Again, absolutely would have been stoked. But, I have all the top tier stuff, therefore I can only compare to that, Stirling falls much short of them but there is nothing wrong with that. In all honesty, I was just happy that I was finally able to support the brand.\n\nHappy Tuesday!",

Delor de Treget is fantastic. This one is definitely a keeper. I get all four of the main scent notes - bergamot, cedarwood, citrus, and lavender. I'm still trying to determine if it's a scent that will hold up for use in the Wisconsin winter, but at the very least it will get plenty of spring, summer, and early fall use. Also, my wife told me she was really fond of this one this morning.\n\n\nIn my early experience with CL scents, I'm learning that I lean toward the citrus ones - Delor de Treget, YRP. I would think that Vide Poche, Fourth & Pine, and Colonia Balsamica (none of which I have, yet) may appeal to me more than GLS or Unconditional Surrender (which I *do* have), so perhaps I'll look to make a move on those after another few uses of the toner to confirm.\n\n\nThe ATT with a fourth-use Gillette 7 O'clock yellow keeps chugging right along. Barrister's Reserve lather helps, too.\n\n\nI wasn't going to use any of my sample of Eau de Treget today, but I loved the scent of the toner so much when I applied it that I decided to give a spray or two on top.\n\n\nHappy Tuesday shaves, all.",

Not 100% BBS, but pretty good. BBS on my cheeks and upper area of my face, and DFS on my neck. Really happy with that because I still had some irritation on my neck from when I got it done at a barber shop.\n\nI also haven't used this brush in a long time, and I forget how much I like it. Amazing bowl latherer. I continue to love Black Ship Grooming's soaps, and I can't wait to start collecting and using more of their stuff. I could easily see myself having a ton of their soaps in the future.\n\nHappy Shaves Y'all!",

I haven't used too many vegan soaps but this one and Soap Commander stand out as the best performers in my memory. Makes a dense, creamy lather with nice residual slickness. I could have used more water than I did (first pass started to dry out) but I'll correct that next time. Smooth shave with no knicks whatsoever. Yesterday when I sniffed the soap at work I compared it to PdP63, but after getting home and comparing the two, I think this one has a deeper, muskier scent. Very masculine and sophisticated. A closer comparison (within my den) might be CL La Foret De Liguest. I find Druantia a tad less musky than LFdL, which hits right balance for me (BTW if anyone has another CL splash they are interested in trading for LFdL, hit me up).\n\nA further note on the scent, FWIW: I dabbed a bit of the splash on my neck last night before bed, and my wife (unprompted) remarked that I smelled good. After this morning's shave I asked her to rate the scent 1-10 and she gave it an 8. Most splashes I use don't prompt a response from her one way or the other.",

I wanted to load a better quantity of soap, instead of yesterday's Way-too-much quantity. Maybe puck lather, instead of scoop, as well.\n2. I picked my Sheraton/Nacet as the cutter to chalk up another shave on my marathon blade.\n3. I just like Cella. Have done lots of shaves lately with new-to-me soaps that I've gotten in lots. The new bases are great, but it's good to step back and shave with some favorites every once in a while.\n\n## Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Gillette - Sheraton 1938 ::: Gillette - Nacet ‹104 uses›)*\n\nThis combo is working well. Today's shave was one where I was mildly trying to have good technique, and I ended up with just a few hairs that had some length to them (in my trouble spot). This is pretty much average, even for new blades. So it looks like the Nacet is still going to keep on chugging.\n\nNo irritation, nicks, or tugging.\n\nAnd this is with not having quite as much glide as usual. I got my lather too wet. It still gave a good shave, but there was some jittering and skipping on some strokes occasionally.\n\n## Soap Notes\n*^(Cella)*\n\nBrush-load notes: I think a 30 second load (with this brush, at least) should be about right. Today's lather was too wet, but I'll try to just add 1.5 tsp of water (instead of 2 tsp) next time and see if we can get back to Cella's usual excellent slickness.\n\nI could have gone back to the puck for some more soap, but I didn't for some reason. And it's good to know that even if you water it a bit too much, you can still get a great shave.\n\nPast scooping notes: Try 1/8 tsp or so next time. 1/4 tsp gave me 3x as much lather as I needed. But today it looked hot!\n\nScent was great and about 4-5/10 for strength. Nice and present during shave.\n\n\n## Brush Notes\n*^(Declaration Grooming - B5 Badger Rubberset 400)*\n\nDid well today. Sure, I'd ideally prefer about 4mm more loft, but such is life. I'm really liking this handle.\n\n## Shave Quality\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Few hairs are showing some tip length (with most being cut flush)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm)\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

I also had a first go at an R41.... woof! Was harsh, but ended well.\n\n## Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Muhle - R41 ::: Gillette - Nacet ‹105 uses›)*\n\nThis guy was rough on the first pass. You'd think I was shaving off a month's growth, but it was just 1 day's. I found that riding the top cap (opening up the handle angle a bit) was a little less harsh.\n\nI thought that such a smooth blade on an aggressive razor might work out -- because it has with others -- but the geometry just wasn't a good fit. I expected lots of razor rash and discomfort by the end of the shave, but it wasn't there. Pass 2 & 3 were okay.\n\nIt seems that the 2011 version of the R41 is smoother and a good cutter. The 2013, that I have, takes more getting used to and sometimes is harsh and uncomfortable. But some do sometimes manage to master it.\n\n## Soap Notes\n*^(Cella)*\n\nBrush-load notes: I think a 40 second load (with this brush, at least) should be about right. Today's lather was too wet, but I'll try to just add 1 tsp (maybe even less) of water (instead of 1.5 tsp) next time and see if we can get back to Cella's usual excellent creaminess.\n\nPast scooping notes: Try 1/8 tsp or so next time. 1/4 tsp gave me 3x as much lather as I needed. But that day it looked hot!\n\nScent was great and about 4-5/10 for strength. Nice and present during shave.\n\nI learned something about Cella today. And I needed to know this if I was tub-loading. It needs way less water than the usual artisan soap. Pay no attention, self, about how spikey and tight the lather looks. Trust your fingers to discern the appropriate level of creaminess.\n\n\n## Shave Quality\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Very irritating\n*Neck*: Very irritating\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Few hairs are showing some tip length (with most being cut flush)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm)\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n----\n\nUpdate: corrected \"ration\" to \"ratio\"",

Calm wind becoming south around 5 mph. High tide at 10:03 tonight.\n\nSecret Santa Shave. Got this set, along with a Reserve Lavender set, in last night from a very generous Secret Santa. I had a sample of this scent in their V1 base. I am not a fan of samples, but it performed very nicely and I loved the smell. While I don't feel qualified to compare the V1 base to the V2 base it's a great base, hits up there with BaM, NO, and DG.\nThe bad news is the wife isn't a fan of the smell. saying that I smell \"musty\". I will keep the tub because it's great, it will have to be relegated to when she is at work in the morning.\n\nThe Gillette blade in the Timeless was getting harsh on the last shave. So I average about 8 shaves on a Gillette SP blade in either the Wolfman or the Timeless. Decided to go with the Schick today as I think the last time I used it was end of September. Found myself having to correct for using too much pressure just because of the weight change. Still offered very nice shave this morning.\n\nHave a nice Wednesday everyone!",

A lot of neat things from both our beloved Otter and some stuff from a far away land. Belize seemed to be the vacation spot from my gifter and he seemed to find some local shaving stuff so I took it upon myself to give the coconut and brush a shot.\n\nLet me start with the brush. This is probably a ~12 mm boar brush. I tried building a lather with this brush and paint it on. It was similar to the feel of poking my neck with a needle. I'm surprised the brush got past the TSA, it could have been a weapon.\n\nI had to bail on the brush, I then grabbed a 24mm synthetic Maggard, timber-wolf knot. I went to town on the coconut, and surprisingly it built a lather. I added some water to my face and started to rub whatever was in my brush to my face. I got some lather built, grabbed my razor and look at my neck..... Most of the lather was gone. There was still some left on my cheeks so I quickly shave that area, not much lather, just some oil? on my skin allowed for glide.\n\nI determined that this was not usable, was fairly dejected at this point and proceeded to use my sample of BAM - Vespers. Will and his great product helped me finish my shave and was luxurious.\n\nAll in all, the gifts are very unique and cool from another country! I am stoked that my gifter thought about someone else while he was on his trip, I just find it troubling that I am trying to find a use for these gifts because they seem, initially to be unusable.\n\nHappy Wednesday!",

I am not overly fond of sandalwood, but this is done very well. In fact, if I used this enough, I could become a fan of sandalwood.\n\nHistorically brushes in the 21-22mm range have been my preference. Lately I have been gravitating towards bigger brushes. I think I still prefer the smaller size, but I am enjoying using brushes in the 24-26mm range.\n\nWork is crazy this week.",

Today in the heavier SS handle, the blade felt considerably harsher. All good though, pleasant enough shave, just a few sub-weepers (went away before final rinse off).\n\n* I know Kai comes first. But is it then \"Captain Titan Mild\"? \"Mild Titan Captain\"? \"Titan Captain Mild?\". It's a very Japanese problem!\n\n* Soap: I had stockpiled Lavanille back in White Label days and still have 1.785 tubs left. Today's use reminded me why I love this scent, but the performance gap between WL and Reserve / Excelsior was also obvious, especially with a fresh AC blade in a heavy handle. I still like WL more than Glissant, but do hope to see Excelsior Lavanille one day soon.",

I showered, applied and massaged in the GrapeSeed oil applied some Wet Barbasol on top of that and then put the Rex on 4.5 and had an incredibly smooth 1st pass I mean flawless. Reapplied the Oil & Barbasol combo for a second pass with the Razor dialed to 2-2.5 and had an incredible ATG 2nd pass that required zero cleanup. I have never had a 2 pass shave be so clean and efficient my mixed feelings are over and the Rex is here to stay for me it truly is a great razor, now time to order more Voskhods while they're so cheap on Amazon maybe I can use a new one every shave since I only usually get about 2-3 great shaves per blade, have a great morning and a great shave thanks!\n\n\n",

Today is our first home game due to the Woolsey Fires here in SoCal. I typically shave every other day, but always shave on gamedays. This is the first time using my sample of Leviathan because my wife detests the smell. I like it, but don't love the smell myself, so am happy it is just a sample.\n\nThe shave went great. The soap performs wonderfully, as many know, and it was quite pleasant. I think that it will be the last shave with this feather, as it got a little bit rough toward the end of my last pass. There is a small amount of irritation on my neck, bt that is just me going over it too many times in search of a gameday BBS.\n\nHappy Shaves Y'all and GO Waves! (Pepperdine vs. Weber State 7 pm PT tonight).\n",

The bot owes me dinner.\n\n**Brush:** Maggard - 24mm synthetic\n\n**Razor:** Merkur 37c\n\n**Blade:** Nacet (3)\n\n**Lather:** Oz Shaving - Nonestic Ocean\n\n**Aftershave:** Oz Shaving - Nonestic Ocean\n\n**Song:** [The James Gang - Funk #49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIwYdEBQQ0M)\n\n[PIC](https://imgur.com/a/jFQfGXP) Look at that cover art. It's awesome. That's one of my favorite things about this company, is the Wizard of Oz theme.\n\nAnd so but this soap though. This is a strong bay rum. A hearty bay rum. This is a bay rum with hair on its knuckles. This is a bay rum that has seen some *shit.* Previously, my favorite bay rum was from West Coast Shaving. It's calm, it's smooth, and there is a hint, a mere suggestion, of vanilla on top. For contrast, I am not a fan of Stirling's bay rum. Disregarding performance, Col. Conk's bay rum isn't bad. But I digress.\n\nI like this soap a lot. I wish I knew how to describe it in detail but I just don't have the olfactory vocabulary to do it. I'm a fan of Oz Shaving and wish they got a little more attention around here. I got this set for less than $25 on a ridiculously good Black Friday deal. My other experience with Oz Shaving is a set of Tornadic, which is a very clean ozone-ish scent. Unlike Nonestic Ocean, Tornadic is a relatively mild scent. I would put Nonestic Ocean at a 6 or 7 off the puck and Tornadic at a 3 or 4.\n\nThis is kind of all over the place but whatever. I look good. I feel good. I smellz good.\n\nHappy Thursday, you smooth sunsabitches. Go get 'em.\n\n",

Both times, I didn't have MY best performance, and my loading / brush wetness level was all over the place. Couple that with a shitty blade, and I didn't have a \"comfortable\" shave. This blade just feels like it's grabbing and sticking, instead of gliding. However, got real close, no real irritation, so all is well. I will say, after splashing on the post-shave, it took about 10 minutes and I was already starting to get real dried out on my chin. Again, very good chance that's more due to shit technique and poop blade, but just an observation.",

The nice thing about the recent gift exchange was I could get all my black Friday shopping out of my system without overspending on myself. When my package arrived and I saw the YRP EDT I ordered had leaked, leaving nothing inside and coating the entire outside of the bottle, I decided to keep the replacement for myself. So for today I managed to rub the remnants of said empty bottle all over so that's about as much use I'll get out of that. Regarding the shave, first time that I did a cold water splash to start things off (due to hot water taking so long), and things went surprisingly normal.\n\nGreat shaves, all.\n\n",

Which will have a big alum block, and a stick of arko shaving soap.\n\nIf the alum block doesn't get here, I'm going to cheat and use the alum I already have. Besides that everything else is a black Friday purchase.\n\nEdit: it looks like my slim adjustable is out for delivery, so I'll be using that.\n\nEdit 2: my slim adjustable was delivered so I get to try it out! I'm pretty excited because I've heard so many good things about the Gillette adjustables.",

This NO base for $16, is phenomenal, absolutely amazing for the price. Great slickness, fatty feel to the face, and an amazing feel after the shave. HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend this base if you haven't tried it.\n\nMonarch the scent. Off the puck it has this grape vibe to it, which was kind of different and not what I expected. But once i loaded the brush and added some water it blossomed into a lav based scent. Hard to describe what else was playing around in the scent but hopefully I can get more the next shave.\n\nThe AS was phenomenal as well, great feel, no menthol (so nice), and cured any irritation. All around just good stuff, especially compared to the coconut I used yesterday.\n\nHappy Thursday!",

Will commented and told me to use more water next time and I finally took his advice. Somehow, the creator of the soap knew how best to use it!!! Craziness!!!! But for real, that was a pretty damn fantastic shave. I've drowned sooo many soaps before that I guess I always err on the dry side the first time or two I use a new base. My skin feels wonderfully smooth and hydrated and the slickness and cushion during the shave honestly can't be beat!",

Setting at 3, but bumped to 4 during third pass. Been so long since I have used a Feather! I felt the hair being cut, but not the blade edge scraping my face. Consistent and comfortable. Maybe at start of 3rd pass, I couldn't really feel any hairs being cut, so I clocked it up to a 4, which was a good decision. A delightful shave. In terms of results, above average for me, and in only 3 passes (no touch-ups).\n\nNo irritation or tugging.\n\nOne thing I don't like about Feathers is that nasty goo/wax that's alllllll over them. Tried today to melt it off with hot faucet water, but didn't work. It really is enough of a mess to make me not use them. There are other blades that get me very good results... without such a mess getting on my razor head.\n\n## Soap Notes\n*^(Cella)*\n\nTub-load notes: 40 second load (with this brush, at least) should be about right. Today's lather was a tiny bit too wet, but I'll try to maybe add no water (instead of .5 tsp) next time and see if we can get even closer to Cella's usual excellent creaminess.\n\nPast scooping notes: Try 1/8 tsp or so next time. 1/4 tsp gave me 3x as much lather as I needed. But that day it looked hot!\n\nScent was great and about 4-5/10 for strength. Nice and present during shave.\n\n\n## Brush Notes\n*^(Declaration Grooming - B5 Badger Rubberset 400)*\n\ndid really well today\n\n## Shave Quality\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Smooth\n*Neck*: Smooth\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Few hairs are showing some tip length (with most being cut flush)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm)\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

My only Black Friday purchase was Sellout which I had held off using while I finished my Vespers sample so the timing for this weeks theme was perfect.\n\nI'm a fan of Aventus scented soaps and Declaration's is pretty great. I have never actually smelled Aventus and have only experienced the dupes (Executive Man and Spartacus) but I would say Sellout isn't as forward as either of those scent wise. I'm pretty terrible at describing scents but what really shines and makes Sellout fantastic is the Icarus base. This one is a keeper and I'm glad it's a permanent offering.",

I've never smelled [Spicebomb](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Viktor-Rolf/Spicebomb-13857.html) myself. The scent off the soap wasn't too strong. It opened up in the lather. The lather was definitely sweeter while the splash was more on the spicy side. All in all, a nice shave.",

I used a new soap (Noble Otter Monarch), one I've nearly finished a full tub (Oleo Windy City) and another than I've used a handful of times and not had burning (Vespers). During that time I used different brushes and different razors. I thought maybe it was the Monarch, since I'd never used that before-although that would hurt my heart because it smells so wonderful. But then when I had that reaction to soaps that I had used many times before, it makes me wonder if it was just my face/skin. I took a few days off from shaving and today I loaded up the Waves soap. No burning. So that was a win. Now I'll circle back around to the Monarch to make sure it wasn't the culprit but I really think it was just generally irritated skin.\n\nAnyway, the Waves smells phenomenal. It is a very \"manly\" scent. It smells like it was a Gillette remake from the 90s. And that's good since that was the intention. It is a very different aquatic and more to my liking than some of the others I've tried. I used a sample but will definitely get a full tub. The Reserve base is predictably good and I had no trouble even though I used a boar and generally only use synthetics with those. Good shave. No burning.",

Currently, I'll get home from work around midnight, get to bed about 1am, sleep a few hours and get up with my daughter to let my wife get some more sleep. Then, when she gets up I go back to bed for another couple of hours then get up to start my day. So I end up shaving around 11 or noon. My wife and I have been trying different things but so far this seems to be the best way. At least until I start doing OT, then we may need to reassess things.\n\nSpeaking of work, I got a few of my weld certs last night so I can actually start working on product, so long as it's under my cert. I'm waiting for my other certs to come in that are apparently still in the testing lab.\n\nNow to the shave - I haven't done it yet. But, I'll bet it's going to be a good one. I've been having good shaves so far this week even having done a Williams Wednesday yesterday. Again, I don't know what happened, but I've all of a sudden been able to get good lathers out of it. For Williams, that is.\n\nNow, as of this posting, I'm off to bed. Have a great day, everyone!\n\nEdit: [This](https://youtu.be/GfA3_H48rWU) has been stuck in my head. Enjoy!\n\nEdit 2: I had my shave at about noon and, as predicted, it went well.",

I honestly couldn't tell if I made any difference between yesterday and today. It just wasn't very smooth. I may not have done it correctly or it may have been the blade or some other factor I'm not taking into account. I suppose it's anotber YMMV situation. Oh well. Next week, I'm goin back to my GEM after I give another weekend's worth of straight razor shaving a shot.\n\nAs for the Leviathan, it's a gloriously strong scent in a wonderful base. The EdT lasts long enough for me to not need to reapply during my lunch break too. It's great and I'm glad that Will is keeping it around so that I don't need to hoard it, because it's worth a hoarding imo.",

Riding the top cap made it nicer when it felt too much. Very comfortable after the first pass. Not a bad combo, but I don't know if I could shave with it every day.\n\nA little irritation seemed to sneak in by the second pass, but face felt good in general, and better with balm.\n\n## Soap Notes\n*^(Cella)*\n\nTub-load notes: 40 second load (with this brush, at least) is about right. This lather might have been spot on. Seemed a bit too dry, but I think that is just the way Cella is. Any wetter, and I start losing creaminess and glide. A lightly wet brush used during load and less than .5 tsp of water for the lather. Might just be a model lather for Cella.\n\nPast scooping notes: Try 1/8 tsp or so next time. 1/4 tsp gave me 3x as much lather as I needed. But that day it looked hot!\n\nScent was great and about 4-5/10 for strength. Nice and present during shave.\n\n\n## Brush Notes\n*^(Declaration Grooming - B5 Badger Rubberset 400)*\n\nThis dense brush sure appreciates the thicker lathers, keeping more of a comfortable splay then.\n\n## Shave Quality\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Few hairs are showing some tip length (with most being cut flush)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm)\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

I've used Vespers 5 times now and while it is easy to lather and is still among the top soaps in the game, I don't feel that it's better than Reserve or even Glissant by much, if any appreciable measure. That being said, still a great scent and great shave. The BB was a little harsher with the Polsilver, but still gave a BBS. I'm curious to see what the future holds for BaM and the possible transition to all Excelsior or not.\n\n​",

Think Perma Sharps are leading the charge, but still need to do a bit more testing.\n\nForgot how easy it was to whip up a lather with a synthetic. Almost feels like cheating relative to my natural hair brushes.

After waking to the surprising sound of the heater kicking on (my wife set it at 73--she will divorce me before ever moving to a cold climate), I set aside my Reserve Waves sample and opted for a more weather-appropriate woody scent instead. Been awhile since I used this one, and was reminded why I bought the full set. Even on the 6th use of this blade, everything went super slick. Alum surfaced no irritation at all, and the splash left my skin feeling really smooth and moisturized. Finally, I have to say that I love this Zenith brush--my favorite of 8 brushes I've tried so far. I would use it everyday except for wanting to let it fully dry out. 6 months in and it just keeps getting softer.",

Got the handle and head off Maggards on Black Friday and got the Merry from T+S on Black Friday as well.\n\nI was nervous to use the Merry since M7x burnt the living hell out of my face and turned me pitch red. I did get a bit of a burn from the Merry, but no redness. The burn lasted about 10 minutes, but I think it may be mitigated by using witch hazel before applying the splash, which I did not do today.\n\nI really liked the razor. The grip felt good in my hand and the weight of the handle seemed great. Got a good shave from the head too. Wasn't too aggressive, but it did seem pretty efficient.\n\nAll in all, a good SOTD. I smell great. Now I just need to decide if I should keep the Merry!\n\nA merry shave and a merry Friday to all!\n\nEdit: https://imgur.com/gallery/TsOrBCJ",

The first two were fascinating but troubling, kind of like what a good horror movie should be, while Druantia is like Macbeth - dark, perfectly structured art that pleases the formalist in me. Love the complexity and interesting notes!\n\n* As for performance, I would rank this as about the same level as the Noble Otter tallow - excellent slickness, easy to lather, a bit out of the top rank in protection and post shave, but given the price point, this is a fair compromise, and a good balm will help make one's cute widdle face feel all better. A great value, fine scent design, and a competitive if not superlative base.\n\n* Frag: Unfairly overshadowed by the obvious Rhino and the weirdass Bat, Civet to me is the jewel of the Zoologist line. Powdery, musky cat with layers of complexity and timed release, this is a high quality animalic that could have been teleported forward in time from 1982.",

It seems like a logical path. I overloaded way too much today. I had a hell of a mess on my hands. The scent is cherry...strong cherry.

I don't claim to know everything about wet shaving - far from it - but I get a good bit of satisfaction when something surprises me. Today's shave was the first with *BIC Chrome Platinum* blades. I was blade shopping for my brother and I threw 100 of these in my order. Man, these blades are really sharp. They are on the cheaper side of blades in general, but damn, they are nice. I would put these up in the *Feather* range of sharpness without the harshness (first shave anyhow). They were a nice eye-opner. We'll see what kind of mileage I get out of them. Now, I get along with most blades, so I may be just talking out the side of my neck, but just thought I'd share.\n\nToday will be a rather lazy day. May look around for more Christmas items for the family. I just need to be at the airport to pick up my daughter and her BF flying back from Florida this afternoon. Great Saturday shaves to all.",

The GSB is older and cut better than the Feather did a few days ago. A little vocal, but comfortable.\n\nNo tugging or irritation.\n\n## Soap Notes\n*^(Grooming Department - Mallard Kulfi)*\n\n20 seconds of loading with a lightly-wet, soft silvertip + 2 2/3 tsp water = enough lather for 3 passes, with not much extra.\n\nNext time, I'll load for a little longer to get a bit of margin.\n\nLather was very slick and enjoyable. This is a good base! Great glide.\n\nScent: I almost think some of the scent was some rancidity, but maybe not. It did smooth out a bit in the lather. A warm, slightly spicy event. Great for Fall and Winter, but light enough to make you happy all year round. They say the notes are: rose, cardamom, coconut, sandalwood, saffron, and vanilla, but I only picked out the cardamom (I assume that's what it is), the sandalwood (thankfully), and the vanilla (I knew there was a small bit of foodie sweetness in there). I'm glad that if rose is in there, that it's a small supporting member of the cast.\n\nScent Strength: 4-5/10 Very enjoyable for me. Present in the shave, without being overbearing.\n\n\n## Brush Notes\n*^(Golden Nib - Silvertip Premium 22mm)*\n\nWonderful light cloud of a brush.\n\n## Shave Quality\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Few hairs are showing some tip length (with most being cut flush)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm)\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

When the box arrived from Maggard's with the Delor de Treget aftershave and salve (the salve's never coming back and Maggard's still has 7 tubs... the hoarding instinct is strong!), I was thrilled. DdT has been at the top of my wishlist since I first tried it in the Big Box of Rare Samples. As far as I was concerned, my SS had nailed it.\n\nThen, a couple days later, I got a message to check my mailbox. Well, it took a couple more days but then another package landed in my hands. This one contained the Barrister and Mann exclusive for Damn Fine Shave from last year. This was another soap from the Big Box that I absolutely loved but never put on my wishlist because I figured it was just going to be impossible to get. But my SS clearly dug through my post history and then dug through the internet and did the impossible.\n\nThe official description for B&M DFS goes like this: \"Will has created a warm, autumnal scent with notes of apples, cinnamon, cloves, oak, and berries, much like the mulled cider that so characterizes the cooler months in the Northeast.\" And it smells just like the description (though wtf does \"oak\" smell like?) but for me that's not the smell of fall in the Northeast... it's the smell of Christmas in Appalachia. When I was a kid, there were lots of family road trips to and through the Great Smoky Mountains of Tennessee and North Carolina. Specifically, we would drive down to Knoxville then over through Pigeon Forge and Gatlinburg to Cherokee, on through Maggie Valley and thus to my grandparents' place in Waynesville, NC. If you've ever been through that part of the world, you'll have seen the many year-round Christmas shops and you'll recognize the mulled cider scent that Will brought to life in the DFS exclusive.\n\nI topped it off with a bit of George F Trumper's \"Do you like cloves? Here, have more cloves. In fact, have all the cloves.\" Bay Rum cologne because more cloves = more Christmas.",

It's fairly mild, close to the Paradigm Ti2 level of mildness. I've yet to get to the A plate, may use that next shave.\nThis brush is nice! Good density, soft, and holds a ton of water! I had to remind myself to wring out the knot before loading, I almost had a giant mess over here! =\n\nDFS and it's great to have the sun out again!\n\nHappy Saturday folks!",

I just love the feeling that acqua di parma leaves. I've found myself being drawn toward soaps with just the slightest amount of menthol. Mainly acqua di parma, proraso white, and blue. They got the amount of menthol just right in those.\n\nThen I went ahead and chose barrister and mann's cool aftershave, which I'm guessing is b&ms take on aqua velva's blue aftershave. Followed by pacific shaving companies caffeinated aftershave balm, which is actually a really good product. Caffeine is actually supposed to be really good when applied to the skin in a circular motion. It also has spearmint (maybe peppermint but I think it's spearmint) and it fit in with today's shave\n\nIm still dialing in the settings with this razor. I had it on 6, but will likely use it on 9 during my next shave just to see what this thing can really do. So farI'm liking it quite a bit. I still feel like I prefer sleeker razors that aren't adjustable, but that may be because I haven't found the best setting for me yet\n\nIm trying to just stick with using nacets to take out a variable while using it. I might actually drop a feather in it for the next shave. I had forgotten how smooth feather blades are. Really they are tied with nacets/polsilver/silver blues as my favorite.",

Kinda surprised the power didn't go out! Very uncommon for us to get this much where we are in NC. Maybe happens once every 6 years or so. Break out the hot chocolate!\n\n## Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Above the Tie - Alluminum ::: Feather ‹5 uses›)*\n\nFor me, the often-wild Feather was completely tamed by the Mild plate of the ATT AL. A nigh-smooth and consistent shave, resulting in above average results in just 3 passes. Comfortable.\n\nOf course, no tugging. And no irritation.\n\n## Soap Notes\n*^(Fine Accoutrements - American Blend)*\n\nLightly-wet brush loading on a semi-soaked (4mins) puck for 30 seconds gave me enough lather for 7-8 passes! I'll take that down to 20 sec next time, and maybe reduce the soaking too.\n\nThis razor often drags with me, but with this super creamy soap, there was none of that. Just excellent glide all day long.\n\nScent strength: 3/10. Lightly present during shave. But is an easy-going, understated scent. Soapy, with some florals that may be tempered by something in the orange family.\n\nI looked it up and no orange in the scent notes. I think the patchouli is the one that is turning the florals into something I appreciate. But I was surprised to see fern in the list. I knew the florals were there, and now that I know it's fern... I can tell you that it's a fern I can really get behind.\n\nMy nose is transitioning nicely from it to Stirling's City Slicker.\n\n\n## Brush Notes\n*^(Declaration Grooming - B5 24mm Badger Blue Handle)*\n\nBehaved superbly as usual.\n\n## Shave Quality\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Smooth\n*Neck*: Smooth\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Few hairs are showing some tip length (with most being cut flush)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm)\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

So right now, I'm waiting at Costco while the tire shop is checking if they can replace with what's in stock.\n\nShave went well; it's been a while since using Seville in Reserve, and I welcomed the warm citrus-y scent for the first time in winter.

I love WK's donkey milk base. It feels protective and slick and the post shave is wonderful.\n\nThe scent is good. Smells kind of cologne-y. It reminds my wife of a cologne she can't quite put her finger on. She's a fan.\n\nGreat shave from the 5 plate. Super smooth. I did three passes on my cheeks and chin and got BBS. My neck got a bit of irritation earlier in the week, so I've only been doing two passes. Smooth, but not BBS on the neck, as expected.\n\nLooking forward to a lazy Sunday!",

It also exhibits a terrific slick layer when rinsing off. The scent is supposed to be a dupe of Chanel *Bleu de Chanel*. I think they pulled it off. Scent strength is on the light side, but is not too light. Very enjoyable shave. Great Monday shaves to all.",

Fantastic oriental scent and the chiseled face performance is good enough to get the job done. The scent on this is one of a kind and I cannot think of many soaps anywhere close to being in this category of spicy-oriental.\n\nChatt Lux AS was amazing as well.\n\nFinals week for me, hopefully great shaves and grades.",

The soap performance is one of the weakest in my arsenal, but the splash is a freakin banger. I just struggle to get a nice, creamy, slick lather from this soap, it just always ends up airy and light no matter what I do. Bah well. I still use it on occasion and it seems like my shaves go fine even with the weak lather. Thankfully, I finally chucked the Big Ben and threw an Astra SS in, huge difference. I might just stop trying those damn BBs.\n\n​",

I wanted to get a soap in their tallow base, and this one seemed fun. The Aluminum ATT razor did well yet again.\n\nHad to pair with my Whiskey Woods from Clubman, another understated product that I enjoy when I don't want to be knocked over by a scent.\n\n## Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Above the Tie - Alluminum ::: Gillette - Silver Blue ‹13 uses›)*\n\nM (Mild) plate.\n\nThis M plate is one that really does well for me. Not only is it a smooth, comfortable shaver -- as anything with the \"Mild\" name should be -- but it is very efficient as well, sometimes giving me a great cut without any touch-ups needed. No tugging or irritation. Good combination for those of my skin and hair type (and all those other subjective variables).\n\nAlmost no stinging at all when Alc-AS applied! Woot\n\n## Soap Notes\n*^(WSP - Ol Kentucky)*\n\n30 sec of loading with lightly wet brush + 3.75 tsp water made a very nice lather that had about 2 extra passes left over. Maybe load for 20 next time.\n\nLather performance was excellent. You can push this guy and hydrate him all you want or back off with the water for some creamy luxurious lather. Provided very nice glide and protection.\n\nScent Strength: 2/10, but it's a smooth relaxing scent, so I almost don't mind it. During the shave, I got an occasional waft of stronger scent, which was welcome.\n\nScent was a sweet (but not too sweet), bourbon-like note, with what smelled like an amber nature to it as well as a hint of something in the wood or smoke family. understated. Not complex, but enjoyable.\n\n\n## Brush Notes\n*^(That Darn Rob - Fanchurian 28mm 2-Band)*\n\nHope the tips soften up. Otherwise, very nice.\n\n## Shave Quality\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Smooth\n*Neck*: Smooth\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Few hairs are showing some tip length (with most being cut flush)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm)\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

BBS on the cheeks and DFS on the neck. I have really been thinking about just searching for BBS on my face and DFS for my neck, because trying for BBS on my neck just irritates the hell out of my skin.\n\nAlso, still LOVING Black Ship Grooming. Becoming one of my favorite soaps. WK and DG still lead the top for me, and I haven't tried B&M's Reserve or Excelsior yet, but Black Ship is right there for me. I used too much soap today, and had enough lather for probably 7 passes. It was creamy and beautiful. Kelly did a fantastic job with it.\n\nHappy Shaves Y'all!",

What a great shave with this Tech! Minimal edge feel and superior cutting!\n\nGrabbed up some DR Harris to see if I could help /u/gcconspiracy with his bowl-lathering issues with this soap. I did manage to get a very good lather, so maybe it will help. It has been way too long since this soap was in my rotation ... man, I love Arlington and Marlborough!\n\n## Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Gillette - Tech Fat Handle - Pre-war ::: Gillette - Silver Blue ‹14 uses›)*\n\nThe is the pre-war Tech, and wow, it impressed me. I did feel the blade a little, but it was very comfortable and controlled. Excellently paired with the GSB. No tugging or irritation at all.\n\nBecause of its combination of smoothness/comfort and efficient cutting, I think this fella has moved up to my top 4 razors of all time.\n\nI used a Maggard handle that allowed me to get a better balance than the stock Fat handle (which puts the balance very close to the head).\n\n## Soap Notes\n*^(DR Harris - Marlborough)*\n\nI love this scent, and DRH has a great soap base. I ended up with a perfect lather, at least to me. It gave excellent glide and slickness, with just enough cushion.\n\n*I'm not saying this is how you MUST do it. It's just the way it worked out tonight.*\n\n* A few minutes soak puck in cold water (just while I prepped)\n* 50 sec loading with lightly-wet badger (a soft 3-band). Maybe reduce to 40 next time.\n* 1 2/3 tsp water added during lather building\n\nThis gave me plenty of lather. Had 2 extra passes left at end of shave.\n\nScent strength: 4/10. Was nicely present during shave.\n\n\n## Brush Notes\n*^(Golden Nib - Silvertip Premium 22mm)*\n\nLove this luxuriously soft brush. However, had enough backbone to whip up a great lather from this hard puck.\n\n## Shave Quality\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Smooth\n*Neck*: Smooth\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Cut flush to where I just see the tips (above average for me)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm)\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

I got really annoyed at how long it took, and how many times I had to touch up my lather with more water, so I stopped there. Finished up with my Karve CB.\n\n\nOver all, I only got one nick from the straight. Not bad, I'd say. Good start.\n\n\n**Regarding the song:**. Who the fuck knows, I turned it off like 20 seconds in so I could concentrate. It IS a song I know and love, I only picked it because it's pretty repetitive, but still pretty grungy and dark. If you give it a fair shot, you'll need to give it some time.\n\n\n\n\n",

It took a while, but I finally realized it smells very similar to Irisch Moos. So, if you are looking for a good substitute for Irish Moos look no further. It's really good stuff.",

I snagged a jar of their Matte Clay during the Black Friday sale and today is the first day I remembered to use it, so I figured I'd match the soap and splash with it. I was actually blown away with the performance of the clay so far. It feels pretty fantastic and holds my hair right where I want it, without making it look greasy and all. I'll see how long it lasts and go from there in the future I suppose. As for the Fourth and Pine EdC, I like it well enough but my son absolutely adores it. So, I let him have the bottle but I still occasionally snag a few sprays.",

The Noble Otter did his part; I let him down.\n\nFirst shave after a couple of days of growth is a dream, BBS with no irritation. The following days of the week I can either get a decent shave with no irritation, or I can get a BBS shave and pay the price. The sweet spot eludes me.\n\nI don't know why I haven't learned my lesson with Alum. It feels good at the time, then I get red painful skin soon after. I need to throw it out, so I'm not tempted to use it again in my time of weakness.\n\nOn a bright note, Lonestar is probably my favorite NO scent. Kinda floral, kinda musky. Nice, fairly mellow scent.",

Off the dry tub, I didn't get a \"great\" first impression. I was expecting more of the citrus with the aquatic notes backing it up. It smelled like an aquatic, but not the typical aquatic that you would normally think of. Can't really place my finger on what exactly it is, but I didn't blow me away or turn me off. Once lathered though, the scent exploded with tons of citrus with some of those aquatic notes to back it up. I look forward to my EdT and splash arriving so that I can truly get a good whiff of this mixture.",

I'm going to add it to my upcoming den clearing sale, but who knows when I'll get around to actually doing that.\n\n🧡 Porch Drinks 🧡\n\nHave a nice Tuesday!",

      "body": "**Soap**: Noble Otter - Lone Star\n**Brush**: Dogwood orphan\n**Razor**: Elliot Langley 13/16 NW\n**Post**: Noble Otter Lone Star AS\n____________\n\n**Jury Duty**: *the obligation of a citizen to serve on a jury when called. One of the highest duties of citizenship, it accrues from the constitutional right to be tried by a panel of one's peers and involves direct participation in the administration of justice. When summoned for a jury duty, a citizen must appear before the court.*\n\nYeah, that's true. I might feel more patriotic flame burning in my chest if I didn't already spend an inordinate amount of my life in court, working as a small cog in the criminal justice machine.\n\nIt would be less frustrating if there was even a small possibility of me actually being chosen to serve on a jury. In truth, that will *never* happen.\n\nHere's how jury selection works. Both the prosecutor and defense counsel get a certain number of \"nope\" picks. As they go through the pool of jurors, either one of them can play one of their nope cards and get rid of that juror for any number of reasons. The goal is for each of them to try to remove jurors that they think might be an issue for their side. Faced with a decision between putting an officer on a jury, or [this enthusiast](https://s3-us-east-2.amazonaws.com/gruelingtruth-cdn/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/14100832/trump.jpg), the defense attorney would spend his last no-vote on me, every time.\n\nEven the worst defense attorney [who got thier law degree at night school](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/52/2c/60/522c60ca3167f10a39c05869830ea529--rick-moranis-ghostbusters.jpg) wouldn't allow me on a jury.\n\nSo, while I'm not opposed to the civic idea of serving in jury duty. I am a little irritated that on top of spending a good portion of my professional life in and around the court, I am now spending a chunk of my personal time, forced to go down to the court building, sit around for a few hours, just to have them finally read the pre-questionnaire and go: \"oh! Yeah... um nope. You're good. You can go. Thanks. \"\n\nEven the Federal Government has this figured out. I received a summons for Federal jury duty earlier this summer, but it had a link to an online questionnaire. A Federal Judge reviewed it and sent me a lovely email that I'll paraphrase as: \"Thanks for your time. You can fuck off mate. We don't want ya.\" All good.\n\nSo I'm not sure why the county/state level can't figure that out.\n\nHappy Civic Tuesday.",

This was the first lavender soap I bought and I use it as my benchmark. The closest thing I have in terms of scent I'd Castle Forbes Lavender cream. The two are very close. Th e old Black Label base still holds up as a good performer. I understand why some folks would want to hold back unobtanium and use it sparingly, but I don't. If I figure that using up unobtainium and not using it at all equate to the same thing ultimately. I guess I just enjoy using unobtainium more than just having it.\n\nI don't know wtf is wrong with me. I really didn't like this brush for the longest time and now it is becoming one of my favorites.

This is one of the best creams on the market in terms of slickess. I always get a good shave when I use it. Really nice scent too. I've been wanting to get other scents but can't decide what to get next so I haven't done it. The mandarin patchouli is nice, and that's a contender. I might buy their sample set again and revisit the scents.",

First the soap and scent. As expected, the Declaration base is fantastic and with little work I was rewarded with an excellent lather. The scent is really, really good. One of my favorites, honestly. I picked up the soap and splash off the Bazaar, and I borrowed the EdP from my dad. It is a great combination and a complex scent that I have a feeling will leave me smiling all day.\n\nNow for the razor. I bought this as a birthday gift / \"Congratulations, you survived the semester\" gift to myself. It was my first time using it and honestly my first time using a \"nice\" razor. I finally get why people buy nice razors. I always thought my Merkur gave me a good enough shave, but this was out of this world. Of course, as with any new razor I have some irritation / cuts as I get the angle right, and I don't think the Astra Platinum is the correct blade for me in this razor (any suggestions of what others like in it are certainly appreciated!), but I love it. I can't wait to use it again (and to try the A Plate!)\n\nHave a great one, everyone!",

Generally impressed - base performance was on par with Catie's, superior to Sudsy Soapery and Dr Jons. Not quite up to premiere vegans in my collection (WK & Eufros) but a viable contender that beats most vegans and some tallows.\n\n* Scent was great in the tub, medium strength with exotic floral highlights, but soon thinned out after lathering and became a fairly low key cedar. Would like to see stronger scenting and more persistence in the shave.\n\n* All in all, at $15 for 4 ounces, no real problems here, and packaging and labeling is quite good. Hope the brand develops and expands more, but very worthwhile as is.",

Stretch your mind a bit, push your boundaries, relax, it's all here.\n\nI know I've definitely expanded my horizons since I started going. It's opened my mind up wide and filled huge gaping holes in my knowledge base. You might even open up to a new hobby. Me for instance? I found out I like dive watches.

Both ended up giving me very good results. And my first time with RPS Earl Grey.\n\n## Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Gillette - Tech Ball-end ::: Gillette - Silver Blue ‹15 uses›)*\n\nThis Tech is smoother than Pre-war version. Barely feel the blade edge. Sometimes not at all. Obviously, very comfortable.\n\nCut was only just a little less efficient than the prewar. Barely a difference. Above average for me, so I was very happy with that.\n\nI think I liked the Pre-war a little better. The consistent blade feel just gave me the experience I wanted. And it was a little easier to keep the angle. Maybe sometimes smoother is not always better.\n\n## Soap Notes\n*^(Reef Point Soaps - Earl Grey & Ginger)*\n\n40 sec load on a lightly wet boar brush + 2.5 tsp water as I built it up = enough + 2 passes\n\nLather was excellent. To me, this is a top tier base. So creamy and slick. Too bad the company had to shut down. I know they had lots of competition, but this soap deserves some accolades and a place near the top. Plus, I found a good many of their scents really enjoyable, including this one\n\nI get an ozone note, but maybe that's just the joining of two other notes. Ginger scent is not very strong, but a supporter (I'm glad about that). Tea is there too, but a bit weak to me. The tea scent is more diluted tea than a piping hot cup of almost bitter tea that has been steeping a bit too long (where I like mine). But all the pieces play together nicely and I really enjoyed it. It's a relaxing and easy going scent, with a bit of what seems like fresh air thrown in, too.\n\nScent Strength: 4/10, nicely present during the shave.\n\n\n## Brush Notes\n*^(Whipped Dog - Boar 24mm)*\n\nEnjoy this brush. Need to rotate to him more often.\n\n## Shave Quality\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Smooth\n*Neck*: Smooth\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Cut flush to where I just see the tips (above average for me)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm)\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

I love fir though, and that is mostly what I got from the soap. Smelled great.\n\nGreat lather, as always from BAM, but I underloaded the brush. I typically do when I switch to the badger after using a synthetic for a week or so (which I just did), plus I was only planning on doing two passes. Whoops.\n\nThe aftershave was a kick of leather at first application, but it dried down to mostly fir. Using this soap and splash really felt like I was shaving in the woods on a snow day. The fir scent is REALLY strong while you are using it. At dry down, it calms down a bit to stay present, but it no longer dominates.\n\nOverall, I'm a fan of First Snow. I was pretty skeptical about it, but it won me over. I picked up the soap and splash on Black Friday when I noticed that the splash was available at one vendor I was ordering from, and then found the soap at another.\n\nStay warm out there!",

I bought and sold a few lavender soaps early on, including CdL. I never even used it before I sold it. Then, on a whim I tried Pure Lavender and loved it. It sort of kindled an admiration for lavender, and I've since tried several others. Recently, I was able to get a CdL set. I like it more than I remembered. The black pepper note I think is what put me off initially, but it doesn't seem so bad now. Plus, it all blends nicely when lathered. Fantastic shave today with bison base. And to top it off my wife said I smelled good today. So, that's a win. I'm glad I gave it a second chance.",

I think this is my 4th shave. So don't consider any opinion from me worth anything! I may pass on a few broad concepts I've learned from lots of research, though.\n\nIt went well. Only a little blood.\n\n## Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Klas Tornblom)*\n\nMy first time with this Razor. The first pass tugged a lot. It was just a 24 hr growth. I don't really know what to expect, so maybe that's normal. Subsequent passes were comfortable. I didn't get as close as a DE, but I got closer than I thought I would! No lasting irritation. Cheeks are easy. The neck takes more strategy and thought, what with folds and things.\n\n## Soap Notes\n*^(Cella)*\n\nTub-load notes (soft silvertip badger): 45 sec load with a lightly wet brush + 3 tsp water = gave me an extra pass or so. Lather was protective and enjoyable. Funny how much of a difference changing brushes makes.\n\nTub-load notes (with dense 2-band badger): 40 second load (with this brush, at least) is about right. This lather might have been spot on. Seemed a bit too dry, but I think that is just the way Cella is. Any wetter, and I start losing creaminess and glide. A lightly wet brush used during load and less than .5 tsp of water for the lather. Might just be a model lather for Cella.\n\nPast scooping notes: Try 1/8 tsp or so next time. 1/4 tsp gave me 3x as much lather as I needed. But that day it looked hot!\n\nScent was great and about 4-5/10 for strength. Nice and present during shave.\n\n\n## Brush Notes\n*^(Golden Nib - Silvertip Premium 22mm)*\n\nComfy and seemed to lather Cella better than the ultra-dense 2-bands I've been using lately.

I've been really hard on myself lately. Over thinking things. I feel like im so far behind as compared to the rest of my peers who are the same age.\n\nAt this point in my life I thought Id have a career by now. Looking at buying a house. Instead, Im still stuck working part time, and living at home.\n\nBut you know what? It could be a hell of a lot worse. I've already come to terms that maybe I'm not cut out to be a cop. It's something ive always wanted to do since I was a kid. I don't know what it is, but im not getting hired.\n\nIm going to keep trying, but Im glad I decided to go back to school, I never thought I'd enjoy the medical field as much as I do.\n\nBest part? I met a really great girl in anatomy, and we really kicked it off in Physiology last semester. I think this new year coming up is going to be a good one.\n\nI think, im going to give myself a 2nd chance to do something new, and to pursue other hobbies that will make me happy :)",

I'll make a couple of tweaks and see how it goes.\n\nI think WWSC is super under-appreciated. Dense, low structured lather that reminds me a lot of Declaration bison.

Really enjoyed this scent, although I can see why some might hate it. In keeping with the theme, both this scent and the Icarus base received love/hate reviews this year. If you were in the hate category, they're both well worth a second chance.\n\nDeclaration's bison tallow base is a favorite of mine and most anyone who's tried it. Perhaps that's a sticking point for some who haven't embraced Icarus. I don't expect Icarus to be the same soap, and that helps me love Icarus for what it brings to the table. Top tier slickness and protection, lathers almost mindlessly, and a great shave every time.\n\nWhen it comes to Lamplight, the scent is a lot to take in all at once (that's what she said). /u/hawns didn't apologize for the lamp oil note or skimp on the scent strength overall, and maybe that's where some folks got stuck. Let it unfold, think about the scent's story, and you'll be rewarded.\n\nI also used my favorite brush and razor from this year. Still undecided on my favorite soap of 2018!",

The first time I used it, it gave me all kinds of irritation and during the last time I used it, same result. After trying again a few weeks ago, I decided it has had its chance and will not get it again. Today's shave though is with things that are tried and true and the result is excellent.\n\n​",

Took the round in the chamber of the shotgun out, but magazine still full. The price of peace is eternal vigilance!\n\n* Product Notes:\n\n* Soap: A third or fourth second chance for the NO base. Continue to love everything about the product save for its performance. Face always seems to end up a bit sore after use, even with various experiments in loading, hydration, application, etc. I end up with a soap that performs a bit worse than Glissant, which makes me sad. The scent is great, the little otter cartoons make me smile, love the packaging and label. Eagerly awaiting next version of the base...\n\n* Blade: After 9 shaves, feels like the Kai Titan Mild Captain is just hitting its stride. Marked for binning after 10 uses though, as is just too damn boring to use same blade every day, even rotating it among razors.\n\n* Brush: Still a classic, especially now that wall of pokey badger has become wall of soft, comfy badger. I think the Duke 3 is probably the one Simpsons to own, but the Chubby 2 is more of an icon.",

My wife works a 12 hour shift at the hospital today (11a-11p), so I took the opportunity to try out a fragrance that seems to draw some polarizing opinions. But first, the shave. Barrister's Reserve Classic has become my go-to \"pair it with anything\" soap. Reliable, slick, luxurious, and lightly scented. This blade is probably near the end of how long I typically use them, but served its purpose on a two-pass shave that was for the sole purpose of my enjoyment, given that I won't be leaving the house today. The CL salve is my favorite all-purpose shaving product and I think as soon as either of the three are finished (unscented, pure lavender, fresh citrus) it will be an automatic immediate replacement. I didn't include it in the SOTD, but the salve plus Aquafor on the dry, red nose seems to be one of the few combos that works.\n\nNow, this scent. I took the liberty of reading [Shawn's blog](https://chatillonlux.com/blogs/news/scent-notes-lamplight-penance-and-a-heros-final-chapter#) on the story behind Lamplight Penance before doing one spray to the chest and one on the wrist to track the scent's development over the next 8-12 hours. I'm really excited to see if it will warrant a full purchase from me or if the sample I used here will be enough to satisfy my curiosity and use sparingly for a random wear here or there. I'm just 30-45 minutes into having sprayed it right now, and while the burning wick note is a tad in your face, it's also a *\"How did he manage to pull that off?\"* smell. It's perfectly done. Excited to see how this is after that note fades a bit and the fruit vs. leather/musk interplay takes shape. Also, seeing so much love for the fragrance in the Best of 2018 thread made it seem like a good day to try it out. Happy Thursday shaves, all.",

When I first got some samples in, including this one, she dislike nearly all of them. Tonight, I decided to let her pick out of the samples which one she liked best, and this one won out.\n\nI personally love everything about this soap. Scent, performance, postshave, everything. It's so freaking good, and I can't wait to get a full tub.\n\nHappy Shaves Y'all!",

And it's one of my favorites. If you want to know what the OG Barrister and Mann Black Label Lavender smelled like, this is the closest I have found.\n\nMr. Greaves and the boys made another appearance today. I stropped it for a few extra laps and it seemed to make a difference. Of course that could be a placebo effect too. Regardless, it shaved smooth and comfortable today, so I'll take it.\n\nSo glad it's Friday.",

For whatever reason, I've always used synths prior to today. I think using a badger was actually a bit easier since it makes it harder to overload. I had none of the troubles with this soap in terms of overloading that I've had the last two times. I am still really enjoying this scent. I think it's my favorite of the Reserve line.

Really liked it.\n\n## Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Fatip - Piccolo Black & Gold ::: Gillette - Nacet ‹106 uses›)*\n\nOpen comb base plate.\n\nVery comfy. Superb closeness on my cheeks. Neck left some hairs with some length to them.\n\nNo tugging or irritation.\n\n## Soap Notes\n*^(Stirling - Kaboom)*\n\n30 seconds was right load time for me, Just a bit of margin left at end of shave. Loaded with a lightly wet brush. Dialed it in well, today. I think 3 tsp water. Super slick and protected me very well. Great glide for the razor. Forgot how slick Stirling is!\n\nScent strength: 4-5/10. I liked it and enjoyed the scent today!\n\nPaired the Kaboom with Pre de Provence 63 balm and it was excellent.\n\n\n## Brush Notes\n*^(That Darn Rob - Fanchurian 28mm 2-Band)*\n\nStill not soft, but waiting to see what more uses do.\n\n## Shave Quality\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Smooth\n*Neck*: Smooth\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Many hairs show whisker tips with a little length to them\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm)\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

The scent is an instant favorite of mine and will get a lot of use this winter. The evergreen and vanilla in particular are just a perfect combination for the season in my opinion.\n\nIn a similar vein, I picked up a bottle of Imaginary Authors Cape Heartache yesterday. I believe it's still 15% off through today, code is FORESTFLOOR. Notes are: Douglas Fir, Pine Resin, Western Hemlock, Vanilla Leaf, Strawberry, Old Growth, Mountain Fog. It's a beautiful evergreen scent, not too sharp and resinous, that bit of strawberry and vanilla rounds it out beautifully. Looking forward to giving that one some daily use this winter.\n\nThe red tip was a daily driver before I started exploring modern razors, and it still holds its own.\n\nCan't say enough about the fanchurian knot from TDR, and this Turn N Shave handle is beautiful.\n",

The density and slickness is just off the charts good. I had a Fern set at one point but sold it because I got tired of the scent. I know Spice is probably the least popular, but I think it's my favorite. I've had the aftershave for a while and just bought the soap. While the soap performed awesome, I gotta be honest with the fact that my face is feeling pretty dry. I think it's because I didn't use muh witch hazelz. Something about the Thayer's or witch hazel in general that moisturizes my face. I didn't get that feeling from the Reserve AS today despite it's rep for having good \"skin food\" ingredients. Also, somebody needs to make a machined stainless or brass copy of the 37c slant. I think that would be my unicorn razor. This shave today was as smooth as silk.",

Been creeping around for a year and a half. Really loving this community and how everyone seems to help eachother out. I feel like YMMV is the motto around wet-shaving and that actually helps prevent any elitism that you would generally see pop up around other hobbies or goods. Everybody here knows that what they have might be best for them, but not necessarily for everyone else.\n\nI also hate you all for getting me on this soap train. GOD I LOVE ALL THE SMELLS",

Free shipping offer from Maggards gave me the nudge to try out Declaration's AS for the first time. It had more of an initial burn than I expected, but that faded pretty quickly. Scent is nice, but maybe a bit darker/smokier than the Stirling take on it. Scent strength was about avg, only noticed it for a couple hours. I like it, but may still pick up the matching Stirling splash if I stumble upon it in the bazaar.",

Also, I was curious if the Sheraton would do better than the Piccolo yesterday (it did).\n\n## Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Gillette - Sheraton 1938 ::: Gillette - Nacet ‹107 uses›)*\n\nBlade is in a phase now where I have to be strategic in the 3rd pass, as well as during the touch-up. Produced a very very good cut on my trouble spot. Worth the effort, for now.\n\nMinimal tugging and no irritation. Enjoyable.\n\n## Soap Notes\n*^(Cold River Soap Works - Select - Sandalwood)*\n\nThis is a very hard soap. Probably not triple milled, but really hard. Couldn't really make a divot in it with my fingertip. So I think that's why the 30 second load just barely gave me enough. But it was slick and worked well. Next time I'll load for more like 40 secs.\n\nScent Strength: 3/10 but at least this is a good authentic sandalwood with nice performance!\n\n\n## Brush Notes\n*^(That Darn Rob - Fanchurian 28mm 2-Band)*\n\nsmall section on one side of brush looks like it is gelling. We'll see if that progresses. I soaked this time for 9 mins prior to shave. I think the tips did soften. So I'll try for more in the future and see. In the past, I've thought that the brush was nicer to me in the third pass, so I'm trying longer soaks.\n\n## Shave Quality\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Cut flush to where I just see the tips (above average for me)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm)\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

Sustained winds of 40mph and gusts up to 60mph. Needless to say, this resulted in widespread power outages. We walked off the ferry and got into our car for the 10 mile drive home and started getting notifications on our phone of various smart home devices going offline and coming back on and going off again. By the time we got home (having swerved around a few of the larger branches in the road), everything on the peninsula side of the Agate Pass bridge was dark except for the casino. We were stuck sitting in the dark with two bored kids for about 3 1/2 hours until the lights came back on around 9:30. Electricity has stayed on since and now the wind is gone, so it looks like we get to proceed with our weekend relatively normally.\n\nTryThatSoap wanted me to use Local Gent's Aquanaut and Delor de Treget. I wanted something a bit more seasonal, so B&M DFS it is. Been 3 days since my last head shave and I had a fair bit of fuzz up top. Two passes with the Feather and it was all gone. Kind of funny that a year ago the amount of fuzz on my head this morning would have been the end state after my weekly buzzing with electric clippers and now it's an unacceptably hairy beginning state to be corrected by scraping a very sharp knife across my scalp.",

About 2^1/2 weeks of testing, and I can't get a great head shave out of it unless its two or more passes. The plate number won't really make a huge difference unless you have coarse hair like I do. Works well on the face for what it's worth, nice smooth shaves, but It's just too much work for the head.\n\n**Pros:**\n•Great weight\n•easy to find and maintain the shave angle\n•adjustable\n•Forgiving shaves\n\n\n**Cons:**\n•too many goddamn plates!\n•Quality Control issues! YMMV!\n\nHeadshave score 2/5\nFace Shave score 4.5/5\nOverall score: 3.75/5\n\nTo end on a more positive note I managed to score some Night Music edt off the bazaar, and boy does it smell good.\n\nWell I hope everyone has a good Saturday!

Had a great shave. Was just my 5th SR shave ever, and I consider it a success.\n\nTried Mallard today. I love the scent, though a touch weak.\n\n## Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Klas Tornblom ::: ‹ uses›)*\n\nNo tugging on the first pass with this straight. Probably because I took YouTube's advice and stretched my cheeks a little. Felt great.\n\nLater passes did stir up a little irritation, but with balm and about 45 minutes of time, it's all gone and skin feels great.\n\nDidn't end up with any nicks, and got a decently close shave, so I'm really happy with that since I'm an SR noob.\n\n## Soap Notes\n*^(Grooming Department - Mallard)*\n\nI really like this scent! I'm a Sandalwood fan, and this one has some in it! There are other notes there, but they all are in the same family and/or work really well together. What an intelligent mix.\n\n30 sec loading with a lightly-wet brush + 2.75 tsp water made a nice and well-hydrated lather just perfect for SR work, though maybe too wet for DE work. Protected my skin well. I like this ratio, and wouldn't really change it.\n\nScent strength: 4-5/10. present during shave and enjoyable to use.\n\n\n## Brush Notes\n*^(Declaration Grooming - B5 24mm Badger Blue Handle)*\n\nBrush did well. I chose it because of the soft tips, in case my noob use of the straight stirred up some tenderness.\n\n## Shave Quality\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Smooth\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Close Shave\n*Neck*: Few hairs are showing some tip length (with most being cut flush)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm)\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

Since I was in the area, I decided to stop by WCS. I was a bit curious, so I asked if they had NeV in stock. After smelling it, I decided against purchasing it. I thought the scent was a bit too weak off the tub. That's actually when Abe from WCS remembered that there was a jar of NeV left on the PIF table they had from their meetup on the 8th. In the end, a tub of NeV was PIFed to me and I'm so glad for it. The scent on this opens up wonderfully when lathered. I'm definitely going to pick up the matching AS. Thanks /u/LUXSHAVE and /u/west_coast_shaving!",

It's hard to believe, but I have never used Proraso before today. It landed right about where I expected it to. It's not as bad as some people say and not as great as other people say. What it is, is a perfectly useable product that gets the job done. It came in a sample tube in a Holiday gift that was on my doorstep when I arrived home yesterday. One observation I made is that it takes a fair amount of product. More than say, Cade Rich or Castle Forbes. That's not an indictment, just an honest observation.\n\nSunday chores await.",

I've got about three uses left in the sample soap, and I think next Sunday-Tuesday will be all Vespers, all the time. It was my second use of this Vespers sample and I moderated the soap to water ratio much better this second time around. Goodness, this base is great. Exploded into lather just about immediately, high water tolerance, incredible slickness. I'm looking forward to future scents (especially year-round scents) in this base. Seville in Excelsior seems like a dream.\n\nPackers playoff hopes are on life support against the Bears in Chicago today. Hoping for the best. Happy shaves and happy Sunday everyone.",

I picked this up on black friday and was skeptical of having a tobacco related scent in the soap. Moreso because I used to dip, not because I don't enjoy the smell. But holy hell do I like this scent. The aftershave scent stays on my face for nearly a full 8 hours. I love getting the random whiff of it throughout the day. It's honestly one of the things I look for in an aftershave. Longevity is key for me, even if it is just an occasional scent pickup and not a constant smell. This is probably one of the few scents I've ever picked up that I wish I bought double of.",

Collectively, we've raised over $1100, which simply blows me away. Due to the outpouring of generosity, I've decided to go ahead and add a Bradley Karve razor (purchased by me) to the list of prizes. This means that we'll have five winners for the raffle.\n\nI have just finished drawing for the raffle winners. I'll be reaching out to the winners to get verification of their donations today. Once I've verified everyone's donations (or if necessary, drawn additional winners), I'll make a post to officially announce the winners and put them in touch with the prize donors.",

This is a hand/bar soap that I got from the Dollar Tree! The slickness was amazing!\n\nI also wanted to give this brush a nice long soak and see if the tips softened up (which they did somewhat).\n\n## Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Merkur - Futur ::: PolSilver ‹10 uses›)*\n\nSetting 3. A great setting for me to give very nice comfort while also cutting very well. Today's closeness was exceptional.\n\nWhat a great combo! There was no tugging whatsoever. Just a superb amount of glide from the soap, with no irritation either.\n\nFor me, performance-wise, this is an excellent razor. Have really been enjoying it. Just running it through a few standard blades, for research purposes, before I sell it. Though it treats me well, I'm just not as much into the ultra-modern look.\n\n## Soap Notes\n*^(Shugar Soapworks - Oatmeal and Verbena)*\n\nA 40 second lather of the bar while in my hand was plenty of soap for the shave. Combined it with I think 1 1/3 tsp of water to make up the lather and I was in great shape. Not a creamy soap while in the bowl. But it did cream up a bit after getting to my face.\n\nIn the bowl, it was quite airy. It might take a future load with less water to hold that down a bit.\n\nMight be a little drying for those with sensitive skin, but I just threw on some balm and was fine.\n\nI really do think I'll shred up one of these big honkin bars of soap and put it all in a container for another shave or two some day!\n\n\n## Brush Notes\n*^(That Darn Rob - Fanchurian 28mm 2-Band)*\n\ntips nicer today, thanks to a super long soak. Might keep trying that.\n\nA good performer, I like the medium backbone of this knot. Right in a good place for me.\n\n## Shave Quality\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Cut flush to where I just see the tips (above average for me)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm)\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

This allows me to dial in the lather every time. Now, most of you pro wet shavers out there might be able to dial in all of your different soap bases, but i'm only an amateur (6 months in). The same soap allows me to perfect my technique to get high quality lathers every time. I also think I have highly sensitive skin and I found out that most citrus scents and lavender give me irritation sadly.\n\nHope everyone has a great week with fantastic shaves!\n",

I gotta say, it's not quite as sharp as the Feather, but the shave is much smoother feeling. There was just a hint of tugging in a couple of areas, but my face has the same post-shave feeling I get when I skip my usual ATG pass (even though I did a full four passes today).\n\nI probably would stick with Feather blades if I needed to go multiple days between shaves. However, since I shave daily, I can definitely see BIC Chrome Platinum's as a viable (and cheaper) replacement.",

So, even though it's not the best performer I have I still very much enjoy using it. A very clean and fresh scent.\n\nShark blades. I havent used a shark blade in nearly 3.5 years when I picked up a de razor as a broke college kid. The blade was on its second use today. The other day I used it with a more aggressive razor and it wasnt quite as comfortable. Today, with the Superspeed, the shark blades performed quite great for me and I was very happy with the comfort it provided on all 3 passes. I've tried 10 or so different blades ranging from feather, to gillette 7,s and once again to sharks. I find a wide range of blades comfortable to use. Can't say I've used a blade that was bad enough on my skin to stop using it.",

Especially since I have a tendency just to oversleep.\n\nThe West Coast IPA is from a sample trade with a very generous redditor. The scent is not for me, so I'm glad I tried the sample. He threw in a couple of other T+S penny samples (and other goodies!) that I'm excited to try.\n\nSo far, I've tried three T+S scents: M7X, Merry, and now West Coast IPA. The scent on M7X was awesome, but it burnt the shit out of my face. Merry is a good scent, but I don't love it enough to keep. I think I've realized I'm not much of a gourmand guy. So, 0/3 on T+S, but I just procured a set of Kyoto that is on its way, so hopefully that changes things.",

It was the gift my secret Santa sent me. I think it was love at first sight, I had the best shave of my young wet shaving career. I shaved areas of my neck that I didn't even know existed. I finished with an ATG pass even on my neck and for the first time I didn't get any irritation. I normally get some irritation if I go ATG on my neck, this time nothing.\n\nAlso first time trying Nekromantik, I loved the scent and the feel but I need to work a bit more on the lather. I had to work it harder than the other soaps I have. Maybe I didn't load the brush enough, work in progress. I still had the best shave ever.",

Now this soap does burn quite a bit. But, I find that it isn't so much an allergic type of reaction. But just an over burning sensation. Similar to when you eat a Habanero and accidently rub your eye or touch or face.\n\nThe burning goes away after about a minute. Possibly due to the phasic receptors on the skin.\n\nAnyway, this Polsilver blade and this razor appear to be a winning combination for me. I'm trying to see if I can catch up to /u/Cadinsor s number of shave that he got on the Wizamet.\n\nAs far as I know, Polsilver is the same thing as a Wizamet, just a different name. Right? I've been reading a lot of posts that say that they are the same, and a lot of folks saying they're completely different.\n\nEither way I received a very good shave from this blade both times I've used it.\n\nLastly. Again, a huge thanks for bringing about the Brush-Butt Semogue. I swear it's probably the most used brush in my den.",

I had smelled many good smellz but Roam was the first time I smelled a soap that really seemed to open a brand new door in the Room of Olfactory Experiences, for me. In other words, in those few months, I had been introduced to some great scents but all of them were familiar in some way. Not even that I smelled them all before but all of these new soaps had scents that belonged to a *family* of scents that I was familiar with. Or combinations of scents that I was familiar with. You know what I mean?\n\nI'm not explaining this very well.\n\nLook dammit, all I'm driving at here is that smelling Roam for the first time knocked my goddamn socks off because I had never smelled anything even remotely similar to that, ever in my life. It was like trying acid for the first time except without the acid and in my nose. And also it didn't last 14 fucking hours but like. I didn't know smells like that could be possible. Like. I can divide my life up into pre-Roam and post-Roam eras.\n\nGod and even just the name. ROAM. ROME. ROHM. It feels good in my mouth, the name does. It feels nice to say. It even looks handsome.\n\nAnyways. Mother Fuckin' Roam. Good morning everyone. Let's go get 'em.",

I loved the razor, but was always afraid it would one day crumble in my hands and so passed it on.\n\n\n\nNaturally I was very excited, when I had the opportunity to obtain a near mint copy of this stellar razor. And the shave with it was just as wonderful, as I can remember. The handle these days is of course way to small for me, but I just wanted to relive those sweet memories. The [perfect Stirling lather](https://i.imgur.com/T5oRub8.jpg) certainly helped and the shave was just blissful.\n\n\nNow if any machinist wants to make me an exact stainless steel copy of this razor head, please contact me - I am still too worried the razor might crumble one day and therefor will not use it too often.\n\n\n\n**I hope you all have a terrific Tuesday**",

It wasn't around very long.\n\nI've been using this bottle of Thayers on most days lately. It's my last bottle and I want to use it up. I mainly use Lucky Tiger. I don't want to just dump the Thayers, so I'll be using it a lot until it's gone.\n\nIt's Friday, right?",

My wife actually likes the scent (?!?!?!?) so I didn't feel too guilty about grabbing a couple of bottles. I'm not too sure if it meshes well with the Barrbarr, but I know that the aftershave scent will fade away soon. The scent for 3 Sheets has been reformulated but it still has the backbone of Shitfaced. It's a singularly enjoyable experience that I can't explain quite yet, but I'll try to do better about it next time I use it.",

This is the first time back to the East Coast since I was in 8th grade. Beautiful city, and I was able to go to Boston yesterday for the first time. It was great. I walked the freedom trail, and as a big nerd, it was so cool to see the remnants of when our country was built.\n\nAnyways, on to the shave. It was awesome. I forget how much I love this little razor. It was the first razor that I ever got. My grandmother who passed away this year gave it to me for Christmas last year. It was her grandfathers and I believe it is from the 1930s. Its so smooth on my skin. Soap is wonderful as always, but it was a little tough to have enough lather because I was taking the soap from the sample jar and rubbing it on my face, almost like a shave stick. Scent was great performance was great. No irritation. Lovely.\n\nHappy Shaves Y'all!",

Though the shaving was pretty smooth, a little irritation slowly gathered by end. No tugging though. And the end result was a very close shave.\n\n* regarding **blade and razor feel during the shave**, to me, the V3A head feels like a B, maybe an A: smooth, comfortable, with just a little blade feel.\n* regarding **skin feel after the shave**, to me, the V3A head feels like an E, or maybe about half way between an E and D. There's just a little irritation or rawness that is there, that I've never gotten from any CB head that was D or lower.\n* regarding the **closeness of the shave** the V3A was very similar to what I can get via about any plate on the CB, which is ... very good.\n\nI think the little irritation is generated because the V3a doesn't hold the blade up close to the edge like the CB. The blade has room to flex and not be as consistent.\n\n## Soap Notes\n*^(Grooming Department - After the Fire)*\n\ntotal of 50 sec of loading it took to get enough soap. Then 5 tsp of water. Is a pretty hard croap. This one was a bit thin, but still nice and slick and did the job nicely.\n\nScent strength: 3-4/10. Present during the shave.\n\nScent: dry from the puck it smelled like spruce/pine/fir combined with a burnt wood scent. Liked it. But when lathered, the burnt wood scent left and more and more, I began to think I was lathering up with Pinesol. Did not enjoy.\n\nPaired it with Hallows at the end, and that rescued my nose and made it feel better.\n\n\n## Brush Notes\n*^(Declaration Grooming - B5 Badger Rubberset 400)*\n\nI don't think a dense brush like this one works all that well with thinner lathers. Seems it needs the thicker viscosity stuff to open up the bristles/bloom.\n\n## Shave Quality\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Smooth\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Few hairs are showing some tip length (with most being cut flush)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm)\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

I am closing on my new house on January 8th so I've started packing some stuff up and put away most of my soaps except the Christmas ones (MLS Through the Woods, Vespers and Stirling Christmas Eve). I just have a sample of this and used it last year, but have probably a weeks worth of shaves left. It really does smell good and performs as well as all of the other Stirling Soaps. It smells like pine trees and cranberries. I have no idea what the scent notes are and don't feel like looking them up, but it still smells like that to me.",

Another B&M soap that isn't for me. It's weird that of all the major soap-makers, I seem to have the lowest number of B&M Soaps. I'm going to switch to samples only from now on.\n\nDespite /u/MalthusTheShaver 's great brand-review, I did get the True Rose aftershave which is their latest product offering. Maybe a little pricey at $25 a bottle but quite true to the scent that I get off the balm. Good performance too so All in all, I'm happy with this one.",

I've never used van der Hagen blades but have never heard good things about them. But they were in the blades I bought so I figured I would give them a try. They tugged a little more than dome other blades. I struggled for a little bit on the atg pass until I changed my technique. Then it was smooth again. Overall, I'd rate them towards the bottom of blades I've used but still not unusable. I dont think I want to try it with a more aggressive razor.\n\nI get a slight burn from merchandise 7x but it's really not bad for me. I like to combine it with an aftershave with a cooling menthol in it. Commonly with either proraso green or stirling sandpiper with a mid level of menthol added.",

It is an earthy citrus scent that I found unique. I like the smell off the puck, but it was better lathered. The yuzu really comes out once you work in some water. The citrusy yuzu is definitely more prominent in the splash as well. Overall, it's a unique scent that I am now a big fan of.\n\nThe performance of the Kyoto was the same as other T+S soaps and splashes I have used--good. I'm excited to find a T+S scent I really enjoy that doesn't burn my face.\n\nAll in all, a successful shave. Just a couple more days to vacation.",

Even though I got a little over eager with trying it went OK. I went into it expecting to do only my left check (I'm left handed). By the end of that since I wasn't bleeding profusely I tried the right cheek which was a bit harder, I couldn't use my right hand and using my left I struggled to see.\n\nAfter still not doing myself much damage I decided to try the neck, the razor control was a bit easier but the angles and pressure were a lot harder. I gave myself irritation down the outside of my neck, probably from pressure. The blade also felt like it was skipping on my neck rather than cutting. I'm sure it's all my technique that needs improving. Quick tidy up with my DE and I look presentable and feel super pumped to have managed to use a SR on at least part of my face!",

Another great summer release from APR. Off the dry soap puck, I get mostly the seaweed and I believe driftwood. Once some warm water hits the soap, all of the citrus just jumps right out. EdT & Splash exhibits the same. Been about an hour since I put on the EdT and I don't seem to be getting much of any citrus and just a hint of the driftwood. Only put on maybe 1 1/2 sprays (1 was enough for Passione) so we will see how the day goes.",

Normally, I wouldn't have been interested, but it's painted with a bunch of science symbols, and I'm a science teacher (I'll probably post picks for next monday's mail call). Hands down the best boar knot I have ever used. The only problem is that I'm terrified of dropping and chipping it, and with the uniformly cylindrical ceramic, it is a touch slippery in the hand. It'll still primarily be a show piece for me, but the knot really is fantastic. It would be nice to get a more ergonomic resin brush with the same knot. I'm not sure where he sources them though.",

The holidays approacheth!!\n\n## General Notes / Exec Summary / TL;DR\nTesting out another blade in the V3A. Did pretty much the same. Also testing out the DIY Arko I put together.\n\n## Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Maggard Razors - V3A ::: Gillette - Silver Blue ‹16 uses›)*\n\nrougher on the second and third passes with this blade than the Astra SP. But for the money, this head is a great piece of equipment. And it delivered a top quality shave. It just wasn't all that comfortable. I think most vintage Gillettes (and premiums) treat me better than this head. But I'll continue to recommend it, because of the excellent value.\n\n## Soap Notes\n*^(Arko - DIY AV Blue)*\n\nScent strength: 3/10, not really present during shave.\n\nThe DIY Arko and Aqua Velva Ice Blue didn't really keep the scent strength I wanted it to. Oh well. I mean... it is better than just standard Arko. So there's that.\n\nToday's mix was very usable, slick enough, and protective, but too thin to be creamy. I think it was 30 sec of loading (lighly-wet brush) and 2tsp of water added. Maybe add 1/2 tsp less of water next time.\n\n\n## Brush Notes\n*^(That Darn Rob - Fanchurian 28mm 2-Band)*\n\nNot bad today. Soaked for a few hours before use to try to soften the tips more. I think it helped.\n\n## Shave Quality\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Cut flush to where I just see the tips (above average for me)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm)\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

They both feel pretty good and the angles got much easier. Still not sure how I do my non-dominant side of my neck though, I tried to work out the angles and couldn't bend that way.\n\nThe Taiga sample is almost done, its a great soap but I way under watered it today and ended up with dry soap on my face. It will be a shame when its done, its a great base and a great scent.",

I've been only using my injector for the week, and it always seems to give me a great shave.\n\nI would keep going past this week to see how many shaves I can get out of this blade. However,I'm planning to use only my slim adjustable next week to get a feel for it, what setting is best for me, and whether I want to give it away as a Christmas present if I don't end up liking it. Nevertheless I will make sure to keep track of the number of shaves with this blade.\n\nEdit: I wouldn't have chose this soap/aftershave if it wasn't for the theme. it was a great shave though, and this definitely reminded me of summer.\n\nThe shave was a bit rougher on my upper lip this time, but that's just became I decided to do an agt pass on it instead of my normal 2x xta passes. The rest of my face feels bbs with no irritation.",

Well, I had to hit that today.\n\nSo it finally happened... I stumbled into an appropriate soap for Thursday's theme! When will I ever remember on Wednesday night to check for the theme?\n\nThen I was reminded of how much I love the .68 Timeless. I got an amazing cut, in less passes than I usually have to take.\n\n## Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Timeless .68 - Scalloped Bar ::: Gillette - Silver Blue ‹17 uses›)*\n\nMan, this razor is sweet. One of those miracles where the shave is so smooth, but the cut/closeness is so efficient. Love this guy. No tugging or irritation at all.\n\n## Soap Notes\n*^(Dr Jon's - Savannah Sunrise)*\n\nLess than 1/4 tsp of soap + lightly wet brush + 1.5 tsp added water = lots of slick soap. Not all that creamy, but very good. Excellent glide. Great scent strength. Felt great going on the face.\n\nScent: many flower notes are on the label, but fortunately they do stand behind the excellent peach scent, supporting it in a happy way. Because of all the florals, I can't commit to this soap yet. I need to see how I like it over time. The sweet peach seems to temper the feminine nature of the florals nicely.\n\nScent strength: 5/10. Present nicely during shave, but not obnoxious or too strong.\n\n\n## Brush Notes\n*^(Declaration Grooming - B5 Badger Rubberset 400)*\n\nBrush felt very good today. It was slick with this soap and didn't shove me around too much.\n\n## Shave Quality\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Smooth\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Cut flush to where I just see the tips (above average for me)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm)\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

My progression was Norton 1K, 4K, and 8K. Looking forward to doing some more honing in the near future",

Soap's performance is somewhere between WK DM tallow and Reserve, a very good place to be. The unbranded ingredient-less label shows all the rough edges GD is known for so far, but the core performance and scent design are exceptional.\n\n* Frag: A strange \"gentleman's absinthe cologne\" style scent that has maybe a tad of summer in it.

I think this is one of the few scents in my collection that my wife and I agree on, so it's likely a permanent addition to my shave den. Nice, clean lavender, I'll say that a pure lavender scent was not in my den before this. I botched the lather though and oversaturated it, but luckily my growth was short and there wasn't any pulling/tugging. I'm hoping the aftershave has some longevity, some of the reviews indicate it has good staying power. If so, I might be bringing this with me during my travels.\n\nLife is short, shave with good gear.\n\n",

Definitely got a very good and close shave, but I can tell I overshaved in some areas while leaving a spot or two less than BBS. Been awhile since I used WKDM so I figured with all the Icarusing I've been doing lately I would get back to it and reevaluate it. I don't quite have the \"ZOMG it feels like I put lotion on my skin\" feeling that I remember but it feels quite supple and hydrated, especially to the touch. It's the last day of work for me until after the new year so that's exciting. Enjoy your Friday all!",

Fixed\n\nSo I've been trying out smaller blade gaps just to experiment and I find I'm getting rougher shaves when I move down a plate on my CB. I used the E plate almost every day since and really got the hang of it. I found that the less that a guard got in the way, the less pressure I needed to use, the better shave I got. I even started to be able to go ATG and was really enjoying my shaves. I recently picked up the F plate and was enjoying it even more. Unfortunately, I had a few bad shaves in a row a couple of weeks ago (I think my skin was irritated by one of my post shave products or doing a 4 pass shave and shaving was only irritating it more) so I tried using plates with smaller gaps. I think I just plain old don't enjoy it. Man, tomorrow I'm going back to my F plate and using Vespers.

Does that count as a weeper? A question for philosophers...\n\n* Soap: I've dialed in Exclesior now and appreciate the different quality lather it creates - thicker and creamier versus Reserve - but still like Reserve better for post shave. Still, for me, Excelsior is a huge stride forward from Glissant and its easier to use than Reserve, so this is an excellent new base for B&M moving forward - though I hope Reserve will also continue in production indefinitely.\n\n* Frag: many dudes hate powdery notes. One who does not is me. Another guy that likes powdery scents is Vladimir Putin, a big fan of Amouage Gold, a perfume that costs $42 an ounce. To my nose, Lagerfeld Classic is reallly close to Gold, and costs $4 an ounce. Want to smell like a real life super villain for cheap?",

I've been waiting for an Aventus dupe to drop in a top tier base ever since my nostrils were gently caressed by the divine aromas of Executive Man. I will have to get a few more lathers under my belt before coming to a conclusion, but I may be in the minority in my preference for the orignal bison base over icarus, although both are fantastic.\n\nAlso picked up a Chatty Lux toner to accompany my salve. Have to say I much prefer the toner. It heals and conditions my skin, making it soft and supple, without the heaviness and greasiness I get from the Salve. Doesn't hurt that the scent is also pretty damn nice :) Happy beginning to the weekend!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Not only is it the winter solstice, but also cloudy and cold this morning (by LA standards). Saw a pic of these Qball blades recently which reminded me that I had a PIF tuck still unopened. First pass was a bit tuggy but I think that had more to do with my lather not being hydrated enough. I rinse between passes and that bit of water got the soap dialed in better, so 2nd and 3rd pass went fine. Really like this soap, it whips easily into a creamy lather, the scent is unique and longer-lasting than I remembered. Great start to the day.",

I've now tried all the blade types in my sampler, faves thus far are Gillette Silver Blues and Personna Platinums, but these Treets aren't bad either. I'm usually doing WTG & XTG for best results. Grabbed this Rockwell cream at Winners (Canada's TJ Maxx) last week, today was my first try. Works well, smells nice, no complaints!",

The shave was great which is to be expected with acqua di parma, I like the scent and has a small menthol feel to it. Mainly this cream has a ton of cushion. To bad it was the last of my sample of it.\n\nI decided to use b&m's fern aftershave, honestly it burned the holy hell out of my face, but I love the scent and after the few seconds of pain it feels great. I used Stirling's balm just to moisturize a little more.\n\nTommy actually goes decently well with fern. They aren't the closest match, but I would be lying if I didn't like how they smell together.\n\nEdit: a word.",

New soap scent and new brush (to me) that I'm looking forward to trying. Will this be a synth I actually like? The Synbad is acclaimed as lower backbone! We'll see.\n\nPost shave: I decided that since Alc splashes are bothering me a bit sometimes, that I'd try my balm first, and then let it sit on me while I cleaned up, and then hit my face with the Old Spice at the end. Seemed to work well.\n\n## Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Gillette - Aristocrat 15 OC - UK ::: Super-Max - Blue Diamond ‹1 uses›)*\n\nMan I love the shave of this razor. This one was comfortable and the blade worked really well in it for me. Really happy with the combo.\n\nNo tugging or irritation. Didn't really feel the blade on skin, but I did feel the hairs being easily cut. Very good experience.\n\n## Soap Notes\n*^(Saponificio Varesino/Asylum - Colonia)*\n\nLove SV as a general rule and this one did not disappoint. I loaded way too much. I did presoak for a few minutes in cold. So if I presoak again, I think I'll go for a 15 second load and see. I had so much soap left, but more importantly, it took a while to get enough water in the soap.\n\nThis soap, to get it where I like it, needs water until it looks like hot marshmallow creme. So hydrated and slick!\n\nThe scent was fresh, green and not feminine. Wasn't really masculine either, but that's okay. A great horiozon-widening scent for my den. And with that kind of performance, I can't help but keep it. For those days when I don't want a heavy tobacco/leather/woody/musky scent, this is going to be on the short list to reach for.\n\n\n## Brush Notes\n*^(APShaveCo - Synbad)*\n\nHigh hopes that this wouldn't have too much backbone. Short answer: a little too much for me.\n\nLonger answer: But not too much to make me sell it. It didn't poke me too much upon reversal of scrubbing direction, but it did a little. But in all other motions, it was great. Whipped up the lather really well, and of course, is superb at painting strokes.\n\n## Shave Quality\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Smooth\n*Neck*: Smooth\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm)\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

Boy, am I glad I did.\n\nStirling Gentleman is a nice, subtle leather scent with the normal good Stirling performance.\n\nThe is my first real go with the aftershave, and it's really nice. It reminds me a little of Unconditional Surrender, but with a little more musk and some additional sweetness (but not gourmand sweetness, maybe like unsweetened vanilla type?). This AS had the normal great CL performance.\n\nNo frag today. I normally leave them off o the weekends when I use CL aftershave.\n\n**Legal tip of the day**: When you are going to see the judge, as he is going to be deciding whether or not to send you to jail, don't wear your Tupac Shakur shirt that says, in a huge font on the front, \"Only God can judge me.\" The judge, it turns out, can also judge you.",

Greaves & Sons 6/8 NW\n**Post:** Clubman Special Reserve - Oil of Olay Complete\n\nI set this stick out over a week ago but kept opting for something different. I finally got around to it today. I don't know exactly why, but I really like using this stick. It has a pleasant scent and lathers easily. And using a stick is a novel thing for me.\n\nThis was a good brush for me to use with the stick. It used to be that I had trouble with this particular brush. I figured out that it doesn't take up soap off of a puck as readily as my other brushes. But using it with a stick is perfect because the stick is rubbed directly on the face and doesn't rely on the brush for loading.\n\nFinished things off with a classic splash and I'm good for the day. Gonna take Mrs. Hiker to see a movie. I am not a fan of movie theater prices, but it's the Holiday Season, so I'll bite the bullet.",

Yes, it's that good. The Icarus base is beyond reproach. So much so that I'm really putting it to the test by not using any post shave and going outside in 33 degree weather to change the oil in my car. So far so good though. It's been about an hour since I shaved and no dryness to speak of whatsoever. Quite the opposite actually. I need to pick up the AS though because the scent is killer. Enjoy your Christmas breaks everyone!",

The Waves ended up getting the win in their final game of the Tournament! Then we flew out of Boston and I didn't get back home into my bed until 4 am, so I was pretty exhausted when I woke up.\n\nAbout the shave. Since I didn't bring this soap with me for Thursday's \"I wish it were summer\" theme, I decided it was time to do it today. The citrus scent is so so good, and I think it might be turning me into a citrus junkie, so any really bomb citrus soap recommendations are surely welcome. It's a great performer, and I really love Black Ship's formula.\n\nHappy Shaves Y'all!",

West wind 5 to 10 mph. High tide at 11:42 tonight.\n\nFirst go with this soap, but not with the base albeit it's been some time since I've used this base. The scent it incredible. A nice smooth barbershop that's on the darker side. YRP brightens it up a bit with a hit of bright citrus and floral. And both seem to blend very well into the Qatar. Overall a great shave with great smells.\n\nHave a nice Sunday everyone!",

The new WK base is top notch and I'm loving the King of Bourbon scent. The lather feels just a tad \"creamier\" to me than the older donkey milk formulation. However, it's pretty hard to tell the difference between soap bases that are this good.",

Also trying Cella from the 1kg block!\n\n## Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Gillette - Single Ring 1917 ::: Super-Max - Blue Diamond ‹2 uses›)*\n\nI purposefully chose my cushy soft powder puff brush, because I knew this razor could be aggressive. This one is one that guys went to right after straights.\n\nBut no. This thing was smooth. Holy cow, I couldn't believe it. What a great shaver!\n\nNo tugging and only tiny irritation.\n\n## Soap Notes\n*^(Cella - 1 kg Block)*\n\nThis lather was excessive. I still can't figure out how not to load too much soap. 1/4 tsp measure, that maybe i filled up 3/4 of the way. Gave me 2-3 times as much lather as I needed. 5 tsp water later and it's under control and super elastic. Glide glide out the wazoo. Wonderful lather!\n\nScent was the usual greatness IMO from Cella.\n\nScent strength was maybe 3-4/10 and was lightly present during the shave.\n\n\n## Brush Notes\n*^(Golden Nib - Silvertip Premium 22mm)*\n\nThis soft puffy cloud worked well and was plushly comfy.\n\n## Shave Quality\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Smooth\n*Neck*: Smooth\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Cut flush to where I just see the tips (above average for me)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm)\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

While I am still looking for the perfect blade to fit for my Gillette 40s superspeed, I'm now having a near-BBS everywhere on my face with this combo and without any irritations, redness nor weepers !\n\nI think this will definitely be my combo for every big occasions. Btw I love this soap, the scent is great and the lather I get from it is outstanding. 10/10 would recommend.",

I know how polarizing Tabac is. But It doesn't bother me a bit. I actually like the scent. I messed up and overloaded a bit. I had lather all over the place.\n\nThis brush is a really good boar. It is not as dense as my 610, 620, or even my 830, but it has incredibly soft tips. I can't believe this one flew under my radar for so long before I picked one up.",

You can imagine that I was pleasantly surprised to find that out upon opening the box. The performance of it was great,and it holds a ton of lather.\n\nProraso white is my favorite proraso soap, and the balm does a great job, the scent could be better though. It's not a bad scent, just not an amazing one either.\n\nGot a bbs shave, like usual when I use my tech. That razor is so mild, but still so efficient. That could describe every part of this shave really \"mild, but efficient\".\n\nI posted this shave to r/wicked_edge like I normally do, but this time the response was less than positive. You could look at my post history, and see the sharp contrast in people's reaction. I guess I'm only welcome there if I post pictures of artisan shave soap... it's just frustrating because this works great for my skin, but that obviously doesn't matter to the people there.\n\nEdit:a word edit 2: another word",

Used it a few times now and I'm getting consistent performance out of it. My only gripe is that I get hot face when the soap stays on my face for too long. It also doesn't hurt that this is my wife's favorite scent that I've gotten so far (right after Leviathan) and I'm not against her smelling up on me. The Ball and aftershave continue the fantastic Jon if casting through the scent, which by the way, I can best describe as a spicy chocolate off the puck, but once you get that lather going and it's on your skin it smells like the edge pieces of a batch of brownies. The menthol is the AS is actually a welcome feeling if the soap starts to get my face too warm.\n\nAll in all, my wife gives it a 9.6 out if 10. Good stuff.",

Finally got around to trying Tactical Support from Catie's Bubbles.\n\n## Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Karve - Christopher Bradley A Plate ::: Perma-Sharp Super Stainless ‹2 uses›)*\n\nThe A did me well and gave me a smooth shave, while still cutting close. The pairing here is not perfect. This blade was a little tricky for me today, occasionally striking out and causing a few almost nicks. I wonder if this one will be an excellent candidate for marathoning, so that it is given an opportunity to smooth out. It was still a fine shave, it's just that others are more predictable and smooth while cutting just as well. And remember that's just for folks with skin and hair types like me. It may be your homie. I dunno.\n\nNo tugging and no irritation that lasted past the shave.\n\n## Soap Notes\n*^(Catie's Bubbles - Tactical Support)*\n\nDon't forget folks, how awesome the non-new soaps are. Such a slick lather I got from Catie's today.\n\nHit the lather just right today. 30 sec of loading with a lightly-wet brush + 1.5 tsp water gave me the super-slick consistency that I want, and it was economical, too. I only had a little left over. Dont change anything for next time!\n\nScent strength: 4-5/10. nicely available during the shave.\n\nScent: most of what I got was patchouli, I think. And maybe some vetiver. I wanted a little stronger notes of gunpowder, leather, and tobacco, but was still pleased with the scent.\n\n\n## Brush Notes\n*^(That Darn Rob - Fanchurian 28mm 2-Band)*\n\nBristle tips were not soft, but almost. We'll get more uses into it. But I think the backbone is perfect on this knot.\n\nsoaked it for several minutes prior to shave.\n\n## Shave Quality\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Smooth\n*Neck*: Smooth\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Few hairs are showing some tip length (with most being cut flush)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm)\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

I did go a little far on my final pass, and had a bit of irritation, but it went away quickly. Stirling's take on the barbershop scent is wonderful, it's sweet and delightful. It was the first full-sized tub of soap I bought, and I still love going back to it.",

Because today many celebrate the birth of Jesus, who started in such a way, and then saved the world.\n\nSo today's gear is all about $15 or less for each piece. And it still delivered a creamy, luxurious, ultra-slick shave!\n\nAnd because I used a shave stick, today is a face-lather, something you don't usually see me doing. :-)\n\nI wish the happiest of the Season's blessings to you and your loved ones!\n\n## Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Gillette - Tech Fat Handle - Pre-war ::: Super-Max - Blue Diamond ‹3 uses›)*\n\nThe Tech is a great shaver and this blade worked well with it. Some blades work better, but this was still enjoyable and cut better than average.\n\nVery comfortable shave. No tugging. A little redness of skin for some reason, but no feel of irritation.\n\n## Soap Notes\n*^(La Toja Shave Stick)*\n\nthis is an excellent soap. It's hard, so the stick is going to last you a while. I rubbed today in a cross-grain direction, because I've discovered that shave sticks can really irritate me if I apply them against-the-grain.\n\nMy first pass was a little thick. I should have brought in more water.\n\nI didn't rinse between passes this time, wondering if the extra soap would carry over and help the little brush to go for all three passes. It didn't. Though, I might have actually been able to shave with what I had for pass 3, but I just didn't feel like trying.\n\n\n## Brush Notes\n*^(Semogue - 1250)*\n\nI forgot how nice this little brush is. Only my second use of it and it is already broken in. same bristles as the revered 610, and I can see why it is so. Light, soft, and good flow through. What a great value!\n\nIf I had just $15 or so to spend on a brush, this might be the one. Way more comfortable to me than a synthetic.\n\n## Shave Quality\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Smooth\n*Neck*: Smooth\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Few hairs are showing some tip length (with most being cut flush)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm)\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

Spent christmas eve with my girlfriend, and her family. I made Egg Nog for the first time, and it was a hit! So that made me very happy. I also made some peppermint bark cupcakes that came out really nice!\n\nWe had a little gift exchange. It was a lot of fun! My family is in Mexico, so it's just my nrother, and I this year. My brother is a bit of an introvert. I invited him to go out with me, but he refused. He stayed home by himself. Made me a bit sad. But what can you do?\n\nAnyway. Shave was great! I had 4 days worth of growth on my face. Melted off like a hot knife through butter. Easy, and smooth shave. No nicks, no cuts. No complaints! Have a great day you guys! May your day be full of holiday cheer, and joy!",

Tried to reset the oil burner and it just turned off again. We have a wood burner so it means that we don't need to place the no heat call on Christmas, but tomorrow I'm going to have to call the oil company to come out and take a peak at it.\n\nHope everyone has a great day and a very Merry Christmas.

Definitely gonna hafta day that she hit it outta the ballpark with this one! I already had a sample of the EdP, so I knew that I loved it but I'll admit that the whole package works together in a wonderful way. Speaking of the whole package, if someone has an extra aftershave or toner lying around that they don't want, feel free to shoot me a DM and maybe we could work something out. Anyway, merry Stankmas everybody!!",

I picked up this brush on the first drop of the B6 brushes and my wife put it back for Christmas. Same with the soap. I have heard/read many good things about the B6 hair. It seems to have the potential to have some very gelly tips after some use. I'll give it a fair amount of use over the next few weeks.\n\nI had the opportunity to try a sample of this soap in advance of the release and I instantly liked the scent. It's a very warm scent. Very nice. And SW is among the most strongly scented soaps I have tried.\n\nA good day to all.",

Now, my nose didn't really pick up much on the fir, evergreen, or nutmeg, but if you pay close attention, the scents are there just tip-toeing in the background and holding everything together nicely. As for the fragrance for today, my wife gave me the Rag and Bones from Scentbird which is a wonderful cold weather scent thus far. Really enjoying the pop of clove and spiciness!",

And my first time with Visions and Revisions\n\n## Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Timeless .68 - Open Comb ::: Super-Max - Blue Diamond ‹4 uses›)*\n\nPretty good combo. i think other blades are a little smoother, but it did a great job and cut really well, while providing minimal blade feel and welcome consistency since it holds the blade firmly near the cutting edge.\n\nNo tugging, and no irritation felt, though a red spot at bottom of neck popped up. Surely will be gone quickly.\n\n## Soap Notes\n*^(Storybook Soapworks - Visions and Revisions)*\n\nI think this is a summer/spring scent, with a citrus dominance and what felt like a cooling sensation. It wasn't strong, but appropriate, being an easy-going tea-inspired scent.\n\nCreaminess and excellent feel was finally achieved at the third pass as I dipped back into the tub for a little more soap. I watered the lather down a bit too much at first. Was very serviceable, just not creamy and luxurious.\n\nIt looks like this is a soap that maintains dry-looking structure, even when given enough water. It never \"melts down\" into *hot marshmallow creme* consistency.\n\n30 sec of loading with a light brush + 3 tsp of water = enough lather, but was too thin. Maybe just 2 tsp next time, or maybe 2.5.\n\nScent strength: 3/10. Lightly present during shave.\n\n\n## Brush Notes\n*^(Declaration Grooming - B5 24mm Hammer & Chisel)*\n\nwonderful in every way. soft tips. medium backbone. Delicious.\n\n## Shave Quality\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Cut flush to where I just see the tips (above average for me)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm)\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

Then I dig it out, use it and remember that I love the scent. It's a great soap also, plenty slick and easy-to-use.\n\nVetiver tends to get a bit of a bad rap, but I don't know why. The scent on the soap is is really crisp and fresh. I love the powder finish, it smells like I just walked out of a barbershop.\n\nHave a good Wednesday everybody. Christmas was yesterday. Get those Christmas lights down you heathens!",

My brother hooked me up with a full set of vespers, including EDT. This scent, this scent is just so amazing.\n\nOnly complaint I've noticed is some tightness on the skin. Not sure what happened that I didn't notice this from testing. Seems like others have noticed this as well. Hard to complain because everything else is phenomenal with the base. So easy to use, great lather, great slickness, but the tightness on post shave has been noticed by me.\n\nHope everyone had a great Christmas!",

My mom gave me the Karve CB, My wife gave me the WK King of Bourbon, and my mother-in-law gave me the brush and scuttle!\n\nHoly shit this King of Bourbon is the most intoxicating smell I think I have ever smelled. I don't even know how to explain it, but its utterly fantastic. Highly recommended.\n\nThe Karve Razor is just phenomenal. Solid brass, and I like heavier razors. Gave me an effortless BBS on my cheeks and DFS on my neck.\n\nThe Yaqi is great also. This is my first badger brush, so I didn't really know what to expect, but it was so soft. It didn't have as much backbone as I was expecting, but it was awesome. What other badger brushes around this price-point have a little more backbone? Or even knots at higher prices?\n\nAnd finally, the scuttle. I knew that I would love it as soon as I read about them, but my God that was lovely. It is probably not something that I will do every day, but oh my goodness, it was amazing.\n\nAnyway, Happy Shaves Y'all and Merry Christmas!",

Nice and mild. One thing I like with this one and my 37c is how easy and safe it is to buff. Glad I went for this one.\n\nRegarding *Seinfeld:* I realized yesterday that *Seinfeld* is the only show I know that gets funnier the older I get.\n\nRegarding Sellout: This Icarus base is amazing. I found it relatively thirsty and it took me several minutes to get it dialed in well but wow, what a great face feel. And the residual slickness is outstanding. Hell, I even loved the splash. I didn't look at the ingredients and the menthol rush was a nice surprise. No drying at all. Great stuff here with the Icarus.\n\nBuuuuuuuut. I gotta say...I just prefer Executive Man, strictly in terms of scent. And so I'm gonna let this set go. But I'ma offer it here first.\n\nThe original owner said he used the set 5x. I used it once, making it 6x total. I'm looking to trade this specifically for a set of Reserve Waves. If that trade sounds good to you, please PM me. If I don't hear from anyone today, I'll put it on the bazaar ~~tomorrow~~ and if I get no bites there, I'm adding it to a lot that I want to move.\n\nSo.\n\nSellout for Waves. Hit me up.\n\nHappy Thursday!\n\n**EDIT:** Or this whole set for your Lamplight Penance soap.",

Then a few weeks ago /u/Hyvasuomi79 starts preaching about blooming Icarus. I ignored him at first and then yesterday he comforted me by saying don't be embarrassed it'll be okay. Well, I bloomed Icarus today and gee wiz.... hyva is right. It makes the soap much easier to load and softens it up just right. Give it a try and see what you think.",

This is the pre-DM tallow formula. It kinda got overshadowed by the updated bases of soaps these days. I had forgotten how good this base is in its own right. The biggest surprise to me was the scent. I didn't remember liking it as much as I did today. When I bought it I was expecting an \"in your face\" vetiver forward scent like Marshlands, Glace Herbe and Reunion. It is definitely not that. What it is is a nicely blended scent that gives me a subtle scratch for that vetiver itch. It's nice to revisit things. I'm glad I dug this one out today.\n\nGoing back to work yesterday sucked, but not near as badly as I was expecting.",

Fat fewer nicks this time and figured out my lather problems. Due to shaving cheeks first then necks I was doing lots of weird contortion and basically wiping the lather off my neck in places, the little there was left then dried. Today I did dominant cheeks and neck and tried to not push my neck down as much and by the time I got to my non dominant side the lather was still fine. Either that of the Reserve base is magic and solves all your lather problems.",

In which case I usually go between this one or something lavender. I guess it has that bright citrus smell that kinda lets you know everything will be OK. Not to mention the cream and soap are excellent if you have irritated skin from a bad shave the previous day.\n\n​",

Apologies.*\n\n## General Notes / Exec Summary / TL;DR\n\nToday I managed to see the Theme before the shave!!! Woot. So I did the best I could, since I'm on the road. Campfires have been with me throughout my whole life, with some great times surrounding them whether we were camping, burning leaves in the Fall, or sitting around the fire pit at home, roasting hot dogs and marshmallows.\n\nA good shave. Tried WCS soap for the first time, and maybe the first time I've shaved with my Merkur 34C.\n\n## Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Merkur - 34C ::: Super-Max - Blue Diamond ‹5 uses›)*\n\nThis razor (and many others) leaves the bottom edge of the blade unsupported for about 5mm or so. Once you shave with a razor that clamps down near the edge from top and bottom (Wolfman, Karve CB, Timeless, Fatip Grande, Old Type, Game Changer), you can usually tell the ones that don't.\n\nSome blade feel, but still comfortable. I actually, at least with this blade, wouldn't consider this razor mild, but more near the middle of the road... maybe 4 out of 9. and that's probably why it is so popular. Works well for many folks.\n\nI think it's a bit overpriced, but still a good razor. Handled well, good balance. Looks small in my hands.\n\nComfy shave with no irritation or tugging.\n\n## Soap Notes\n*^(West Coast Shaving - Campfire)*\n\nA good soap. Slick and creamy if you mix it right.\n\n30 second load with lightly wet (but large) brush + 2.75 tsp water = gave me twice as much soap as I needed, but was excellent in consistency. It ended up just the way I prefer it: on the wet side of creamy, giving both a luxurious feel and the razor great glide.\n\nIt structured up very quickly with just the minimal water from the brush, and didn't change too much, visually, as I continued to add almost 3 tsp of water to it. funny how some soaps do that.\n\nScent was a pretty authentic burnt wood and I enjoyed it.\n\nScent Strength: 4-5/10. Just the way I'd like it for this scent. Nicely present during the shave, but not overpowering.\n\n\n## Brush Notes\n*^(That Darn Rob - Fanchurian 28mm 2-Band)*\n\nI think the knot's tips are softening gradually. soaked them for several mins before the shave. But it could be my imagination. Was fairly nice today.\n\n## Shave Quality\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Few hairs are showing some tip length (with most being cut flush)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm)\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

My oleo Shiloh soap/aftershave balm came in along with my chatillon lux lavender skin salve. I find lavender and citrus both very relaxing, so I had no choice but to use what I had in today's package.\n\nI absolutely had to pick the Edwin Jagger de89, with a brand new feather blade for a theme like this. That blade/razor together are perfection for me. I can get a bbs shave with no effort with no irritation with those together.\n\nThe scent of Shiloh is well done, very fresh and clean. This is my first time using the canard base, and I was thoroughly impressed. For my skin/face it is probably the best performance I've ever gotten from a soap. The preshave was perfect, no dryness, and the balm added just the right amount of moisture.\n\nAfter putting away/drying up everything, and giving the balm plenty of time to soak in, I wiped my face and put on a small amount of the chatillon lux pure lavender skin salve, partially because I'm a lavender addict, and partially because if I don't test out the stuff I got in the mail I know I'll obsess over it.\n\nSo yeah, fucking awesome shave.",

      "body": "**Dec. 28, 2018**\n\n**Prep:** Hot shower\n**Brush:** Proraso boar brush\n**Razor:** Edwin Jagger DE89\n**Blade:** Polsilver super iridium (4)\n**Lather:** [Declaration Grooming - Darkfall - Soap](https://trythatsoap.com/collection/408/?product_type=soap)\n**Post Shave:** [Chatillon Lux - Bon Vivant - Toner](https://trythatsoap.com/collection/510/?product_type=toner)\n\n\nYesterday I received a few things from Maggards : a Captain's choice lather bowl, DG Darkfall soap and CL Bon Vivant Toner. I decided to give a try to all of it, even if I'm not sure the soap & toner scent are a perfect combination x)\n\nAs usual, the soap base performs very well, it does make a wonderful lather. But this time, as opposed to DG Sellout, the scent was outstanding to me. I didn't love Sellout, I just liked it. But here, I ordered Darkfall by reminding a list someone posted in a \"newbie questions\" thread weeks ago. Someone asked what scents people could use everyday and a redditor had this soap in his list, so I decided to give it a try and I regret nothing. I could not remember smelling something similar ever, as I'm unfortunately a metropolitan, and I absolutely loved it !\n\nAbout the toner, the funny thing is that the bottle opened just a little in the package while being shipped, so maybe a 1/100th of the toner got out of the bottle and spread out in the package. But when I first opened the package, even though Maggards put the toner in a plastic bag, I could instantly smell the toner scent and I was like \"damn, packages can have a pleasant perfume in the US lol\". So I decided to smell like that after my next shave, even if I'm not sure of the compatibility between today's soap and toner :)\n\nAnyway, everything performed very well and I like my current smell, that is what matters. Have a great STOD y'all !",

See below for scent description. I've been so blown away by the support from you guys, and I feel privileged to be able to do this.\n\nFeel free to reach out and let me know if you snagged a soap or set! I'll be working my real job all day but will try and keep up with messages.\n\n\n------------\n\nANNOUNCEMENT: the second Mammoth scent, Mood Indigo, drops this Friday, December 28, at 10amEST, only at www.WestCoastShaving.com. Limit one per customer. $1 from every tub will be donated to RestoreNYC to further their work to end sex trafficking in New York and restore the well-being and independence of foreign-national survivors.\n\n\"Mood Indigo\" is a great Duke Ellington blues tune that's been covered by all the great jazz singers. A lot of people think the blues is a sad genre of music, but it's not. The blues is cathartic, a way for people to give voice to their troubles and find support. Keeping your struggles and sadness to yourself is what makes things worse, so in that sense the blues helps us realize we're not alone. So my thought with Mood Indigo is that it should smell like you're leaving that blues club late at night, tired but feeling good, a little less alone. You take a look up at the night sky and breathe a bit, and sort of unconsciously hum the tune to Mood Indigo.\n\nNotes are black pepper, oud, vetiver, blueberry, rum, and night sky. It's not dirty or smoky, but warm and smooth. It's Mood Indigo, and I hope you like it.",

Thanks to a very generous gift from /u/maddingersyo.\n\nThe generosity that the Stirling showed by donating 100% of the soap profits to first responders was amazing.\n\nThe scent on the soap is interesting. It's not bad, but difficult to describe. It strikes me as a \"fresh, clean\" soap scent. Like if you threw jn a couple of bars of Irish spring, and a bar of Lever soap, and a couple dashes of Old Spice aftershave, and mixed them all up. You'd get a scent like this. It's not generic, per se, but it's not B&M level of complexity either.\n\nThe soap yielded a perfectly passable shave. And I'll continue to use it.\n\nThe WCS badger(?) brush continues its slow spiral into disappointment. It was the first brush I bought. I leave it at work for a locker room brush. But the more I use other brushes and brooshes, the more I'm awakened at how terrible the WCS brush is. I'm certain that the tips are clipped. The ends of that brush are so rough it feels like a tiny brillow pad. But again, it works. It yields a passable, if not luxurious shave.\n\nThanks again to /u/maddingersyo.\n\nHappy Friday all. And nearly the end of 2018. Cheers.",

So, I shaved like a pleb. The biggest adjustment was getting used to how light the disposable is compared to my normal R41. Got a decent shave but my face was super dry afterwards, probably due to that crusty old ass Gillette goo, but the Reserve Waves took care of that.\n\nNow off to get fat and happy on BBQ.",

Great shave. Trying Conquest for the first time. A milder scent, but I love the accord.\n\nI think I'm within 3 days of killing this bottle of Nivea balm once and for all.\n\n## Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Gillette - Aristocrat 15 OC - UK ::: Perma-Sharp Super Stainless ‹3 uses›)*\n\nGreat combo between razor and blade, for me at least. What a great and comfy cutter. not super smooth, but consistent and predictable, while minimal, edge feel.\n\nThis blade hasn't been great in all my razors. The last couple have been a little scratchy... maybe that's the word.\n\nNo tugging or irritation.\n\n## Soap Notes\n*^(Dr Jon's - Conquest)*\n\nGreat lather from DJ's as usual. Slick. This time, I hoked out just the right amount, and had barely any in my bowl by the end. Usually I overshoot by a couple of passes.\n\na bit less than 1/4 tsp of soap + lightly wet boar + 1.5 tsp water made a good lather that was dialed in pretty well. Maybe a little less water next time, but really very nice.\n\nScent: didn't really notice it too much when shaving, but I forgot to. So I 'll have to hit it again and pay more attention. But that also means that it probably wasn't all that strong. Maybe a 2-3/10 if I had to guess.\n\nBut I did like the Sandalwood, Mandarin, blackberry, and spices that were the main notes, with SW not being as strong as the others.\n\nThis one is a part of his Cold War series, with Propaganda (love it) and Defiance (did not like the allspice) being the other two.\n\n\n## Brush Notes\n*^(Semogue - 1250)*\n\nGreat little guy did the brand proud, and at only it's 3rd use. This one came to me broken in basically!\n\n## Shave Quality\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Smooth\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Cut flush to where I just see the tips (above average for me)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm)\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

Unfortunately, the new Blackbird hasn't arrived yet (from US to Denmark), so I have to use my Rockwell until it arrives. Even with plate 6 I think the Rockwell lacks efficiency and blade feel.

The Piccolo and Permasharp are a great combo of smoothness and efficiency, so I'm happy that this razor has found a home in my rotation.\n\nSeems like 2 days is the sweet spot for me avoiding irritation, but I think I'm too stubborn to actually stick to that timeline.

BarrBarr really is my favorite take on a barbershop soap that I've come across given the amazing performance of the soap base and the scent. I'll probably save the lavender aftershave for spring/summer, but I wanted to give it a try before putting it away for a couple of months.\n\nI've also been slowly breaking in a new boar brush that I received for taking second in Sample September (thanks u/spazztik88!). I've soaked it overnight a couple of times performed about 20 mock lathers to finish splitting the hairs. The tips are getting awfully soft now, so I'm really looking forward to trying out the new brush next week.",

It is mild, but remains effective nonetheless. It did really well with the feather today for me.\n\nThen I revisited dark vetiver and I'm very glad I did because that is definitely a keeper.\n\n## Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Wolfman - Guerilla ::: Feather ‹6 uses›)*\n\nMan this thing is nice. And I think the thick handle didn't bother me this time like it did before, a year ago or so, when I was trying to use it. Lately, I have always replaced the handle with something else in my inventory. But it was nice to use the stock version tonight.\n\nNo tugging at all, just a nice smooth cutting action. A few points of irritation, but for the most part the balm at the end banished them .\n\n## Soap Notes\n*^(Wholly Kaw - Dark Vetiver)*\n\nI tried this one before, but it was when I didn't really have an appreciation for vetiver. I'm so glad it never sold because I really like it now. This is an excellent base that is super slippery and easy to bring up to lather.\n\nI didn't have my usual medicine dropper so I can't tell you how much water I added, but the 30 second load was perfect for getting me the right amount of dialed in latherers.\n\nScent strength was excellent: five or six out of 10.\n\n\n## Brush Notes\n*^(Semogue - 2-band Badger in Cherry)*\n\nThis brush has a lot of backbone. I don't know if I want to keep it around for the case where I may change my mind about how much backbone I like . Or if perhaps the backbone will get a little less firm with use.\n\n## Shave Quality\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Smooth\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Cut flush to where I just see the tips (above average for me)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm)\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

Henckels 11/16 QH\n**Post:** Nothing\n\nSo I tried an experiment today. A few days ago there was a couple of comments in the questions thread about the Excelsior base being drying for a few folks. I didn't remember it being particularly drying. To be fair, ALL soaps are drying to my very dry skin to one extent or another. I thought I would use the Excelsior base today to see if it is as drying for me as what others have experienced. I intentionally used no post shave products to get a true feel for the soap. It has been 45 minutes since my shave and I must have done something wrong. I'm not getting the dryness that a few other people have experienced. Go figure. As I stated before, all soaps dry my skin to some extent. This soap is among the least so. It's in the company of two or three other bases in that respect.\n\nThis brush is shaping up to be a beauty. It is certainly the gellyest of any badger I own. When it's dry the tips clump together and are crusty as hell. The tips must be starting to really hook. It really likes to hang onto lather though.",

So I chose my equipment a little carefully today. Was a great shave.\n\n## Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Karve - Christopher Bradley C Plate ::: Gillette - Silver Blue ‹18 uses›)*\n\nChose the razor because it was new to me this year and it has been amazing. It's taken off for the maker and I'm glad. It's an excellent piece and it did me well today.\n\nThe blade has been used twice as long as many people like to use them, but it gave me an excellent cut, and it my favorite blade of all. Treats me very well in almost all of my razors.\n\nNo tugging or irritation at all. very comfortable. and my normal 3.5 passes was plenty enough to quell this non-standard 2 day growth.\n\n## Soap Notes\n*^(Reef Point Soaps - Command Presence)*\n\nThis soap is an excellent base. I chose RPS because they closed down this year and I think their stuff is just excellent. I like Aviator, Submariner, and Earl Gray a a bit better than this powdery offering, but the slickness is top notch.\n\n30 sec load with a lightly-wet brush + 3 tsp water gave me about 2 passes of extra lather at the end, and it was dialed in to suit me perfectly. Excellent glide and protection.\n\n\n## Brush Notes\n*^(Declaration Grooming - B5 24mm Hammer & Chisel)*\n\nSo good today. An excellent combo of medium backbone and super soft tips. Shames most other brushes.\n\n## Shave Quality\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Cut flush to where I just see the tips (above average for me)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm)\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

It's my go to razor and serves as a perfect baseline for testing these blades.\n\nI'll likely be using this soap and post shave too, to keep things consistent.\n\nThese blades were nice, because they are slightly bigger than other blades it makes them truly more aggressive. They are decently sharp, and knowing my de89 it was easy to notice the increased blade feel. These aren't going to be my new daily blade.\n\nIt will be cool to use these to increase the aggressiveness of different razors.\n\nTomorrow's blade will be the bolzano supernox, I can't wait to try these ones out. After that I have treet classic, Gillette platinum, rapira sweedish supersteel, and then I bought Astra platinum, and super stainless to retry.\n\nI also really want to try Gillette Ruby, but I can't find them anywhere and rapira platinum lux (I think that's what they are called.",

Another go with LRSC *Hawkeye*. This soap is really, really good. The couple of negatives I have is (1) The soap container is just way too narrow. The Zenith pretty much filled up the space, so there wasn't a whole lot of room to load the brush. (2) I pick up the scent of the soap itself (tallow). I will try airing it out and see if that clears things up a bit. The scent is on the light side, so we'll see how that goes. The performance is excellent. As of this posting, I haven't decided on an aftershave, so yeah. One of the toughest decisions I will have today! ;-) Great New Year's Eve shaves to all. Except you bastards in Australia since it is already New Year's Day!",

My daughter got a bunch of stuff including a doll house. I got my wife a gift certificate for a massage and a consultation appointment for a tattoo. I didn't get any shave related stuff but my wife surprised me with some [coffee stuff](https://i.imgur.com/SLszFkM.jpg) and my roommates got me [coffee](https://i.imgur.com/07kQHn7.jpg). That Nanopresso is awesome! I've been making shots with it and it does a great job.\n\nNow time to leave this dumpster fire of a year and start the next one! Happy New year!",

Solid soap though. I wonder if it was from when they arguably stole an idea from MLS, but it is decent soap. I think this is scented with the same FO used in Stirling's barbershop, so I'll just grab that when I kill this tin, which is starting to get low, but no ring of death yet.\n\n​\n\nThis was not, obviously, my NYE shave. That will likely be with Lamplight Penance, which I think was the scent of the year for 2018.",

I really do like the almost sour citrus note from the yuzu. I only gave one spray of the EdT on the back of my hand in order not to overpower with the scent as well as to track its development over a few hours. Oddly, the toner was more citrus forward and the EdT more patchouli forward. I really like this one. It's fresh and easily wearable, and I could see it getting use in the spring and summer especially, though the patchouli note darkens it up enough to fit in year round. Nicely done!",
