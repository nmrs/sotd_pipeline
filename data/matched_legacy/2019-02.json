Years ago when I started this hobby Cella was one of my first ten soaps and took me AGES for figure out, simply because I wasn't loading enough. For me it's a load it like you hate it kinda soap. Aqua Velva Musk is my go-to with Cella, I feel like they greatly compliment one another. Got about 5 inches of snow last night, and thought some Grateful Dead would help make for a cozy morning before spending 10 minutes clearing off the car. This is my favorite version of Sugar Magnolia; love the long bridge leading to the outro. Happy Friday my friends!",

I've used it before but it's been A while. I think my initial observation that it's like a less fatty feeling version of WK stands. It's definitely a good soap though, and the goat milk feels very nourishing. Slickness is also very good. It will be interesting to see if this brand increases in popularity now that Maggard carries it. Happy Friday.",

That was my first real shaving brush, and it's still a great brush. It broke in really nicely, so now it's really soft with just a little scrub.\n\nI got the Grooming Dept. preshave in yesterday, so this was my first shave with that stuff, and it really made a difference. My razor was smoother going across my face, and the residual slickness of the soap was bumped up quite a bit. The biggest difference, though, was the post-shave feel. I didn't even feel like I needed a splash (of course I used one anyway), and my skin feels better than normal a few minutes after the shave. Thumbs up so far.",

Enjoyed Chaipre a lot more this time than the first time I used it. Glad we made it through this week, but I'll take the subzero temps before snow any day of the week. Looking like the next few days are going to be unseasonably warm. Happy Friday.",

I also lucked out and and found a Magnum Hammered Handle on the bazaar - it's my go-to handle. Level 1 is my go to daily and level 2 is a bit more aggressive to me and I don't quite use it unless I've got more growth. The level one on the magnum Handle is great.\n\nI have the option to pick up max 2 of each part (top cap, base plate, handle). The question is should I pick up an open comb or dual comp level 1? Has anyone tried their open combs?\n\nI know they're a small batch shop so not sure how many people here are familiar or have used them, but thought I'd put it out there to get some advice.",

Wanted to get in another cheap soap. I expected yesterday's theme to have a Williams user in it. So I bring it to you now. An amazing lather.\n\n#### Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Baili - BD191 Long Handle ::: Feather ‹11 uses›)*\n\nExcellent combo. This is the head from the Baili mentioned. It is the same head as the Vikings Blade Godfather, which you can pay $38 more for.. if you want.\n\nWeighty, stainless WCS handle. I bought it on sale, and I just can't get past the ugly onion-shaped top. So I never use it. But this head hides it a bit, so I think we've found a match.\n\nHighly recommend this head for beginners because of nice grip on blade near the edge. I think I like it better that the DE89s. Kinda like a Tech. Plus, perfect blade alignment. However, I can't rec this to beginners because of the slick chrome handle. So... I looked it up and the BD176 (available on AliExpress.com or Amazon) looks like it has the same head, but with a more grip-secure handle.\n\n#### Soap Notes\n*^(Williams Mug Soap)*\n\nseveral min presoak in cold on top of puck (2.5 tsp) + 45 sec load with a medium-light wet brush = 3.5 tsp water = 5-6 passes of slick, creamy lather! Pretty sure most people don't know that you can get a lather like this from Williams!\n\nI'll reduce it to 20-30 sec load next time.\n\nI put 2.5 tsp cold water on the soap to soak for several mins. Then that went into the lather bowl. So, no soap wasted!\n\n\n#### Brush Notes\n*^(Zenith - B10 Boar Red)*\n\nenjoyable. held plenty of lather and felt pretty good on the face. I like the good number of hairs on this brush. More than most Semogues.\n\n#### Shave Quality\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Smooth\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Cut flush to where I just see the tips (above average for me)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm)\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

Leaving straight from work to drive up to Whistler so the kids can spend tomorrow playing in the snow. Thus, I did my usual morning routine before bed. First shave with the LLC and it was pretty nice. Good Barrister and Mann performance, though I think I like the lavender/cedar scent of Flowers in the Dark more than I like LLC. I suppose further shaves will clear things up.\n\nDidn't bother packing a razor for the weekend, so no SOTD for me until Monday probably. Maybe Sunday night or Monday morning I'll get to use that ATT razor that showed up in the mail yesterday.",

He is a pleasure to deal with, and does great work to boot. Proud to have one of his brushes in my rotation, and will hopefully one day get a custom order in.\n\nStill amazed with how good this beef tallow formula is from Wholly Kaw. The fact that Sri keeps finding ways to improve on what was already an elite base in nothing short of remarkable. Can't wait to get my hands on some buffala. Evens sounds delicious!

Rather than admit to myself maybe I hit perfection the first time and grab another Astra, I dove into my bag of random blades and saw a 5-pack of Sharks i've never opened before, must have come in a sampler or something. I figured why not and threw one in. After 2 strokes, I took it out, complete draggy, razor skipping, horrible. I know some people power through thinking maybe it'll get better 2nd shave, but i'm not one for that. If it's not great out of the gate I don't care, it was under a quarter, it's going in the trash. Maybe i'll try one of the other 4 in another razor eventually, maybe not. Swapped it out for the GSB and while not as comfortable as the Astra, it was fine, and one i'm fine giving a go until day 2. Luckily I had a great soap to help bail me out today.",

The razor and blade combo is definitely a bit too rough for my taste so I'll switch it up next time.\n\n**The Soap** was amazing! Maybe it was the change in my technique but Stirling Barbershop soap gave me a much better lather than the Sharp Dressed Man. I did have a bit wetter brush to work with so it was messy. However, I got a creamy and enough lather to work with. Smooth and Slick.\n\n**The Razor and Blade** combination was a bit rough today. It feels fine on my cheeks but on the neck, it was rough. Not the worst but the open comb with a duller blade like Derby doesn't work out for me. I'll put in something more sharp like Voshkod or Astra and maybe pair the Derby with my regular razors (EJ89 or Merkur 34C).\n\n**The Brush** was very nice. It felt better today as I put together a more creamier lather. Soft, dense, and holds a ton of water. Only thing is that I don't like the density as much as other brushes. It's a little too dense for me but that's just my personal taste. I still enjoy it and will keep it in my brush rotation.\n\n**The aftershave portion** was great. I felt the stinging sensations with the Alum block, especially the weepers and my neck. But I still love that dry and tight feeling with the alum; I'm glad I got the alum block. Paired with the Stirling balm, my face is good to go. Plenty moisturized and smelling nice with the Executive Man scent.\n\nOverall, a decent shave. I'll change up the razor/blade combo next time and that should improve the shave a bit more.",

Using the Williams again, to reduce the load time and refine.\n\n#### Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Timeless .68 - Open Comb ::: Feather ‹12 uses›)*\n\nGood combo, but you have to respect it and watch your technique. Awesome at slicing through the first pass. No tugging and only a little irritation (on neck). Maybe try a less sharp blade in this razor next time.\n\n#### Soap Notes\n*^(Williams Mug Soap)*\n\nseveral min presoak in cold on top of puck (2.5 tsp) + 30 sec load with a medium-light wet brush = 3.5 tsp water = 5-6 passes of slick, creamy lather!\n\nI'll reduce it to 20 sec load next time, since I had that much extra.\n\nI put 2.5 tsp cold water on the soap to soak for several mins. Then that went into the lather bowl. So, no soap wasted!\n\n\n#### Brush Notes\n*^(Semogue - 1800 Boar)*\n\nThis little guy is pretty comfortable, I don't think I got brush burn. Young, but tips are getting nice already. Held soap well. My shortcut method of soaking for a few hours before use seems to be working.\n\n#### Shave Quality\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Smooth\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Few hairs are showing some tip length (with most being cut flush)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm)\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

I imagine that this scent would grow on me in time, scents seem to do that, but I really don't see me getting a full tub at this point.\n\nI'm looking forward to the weather warming up this weekend.

I was really iffy on the prospect of powder being listed so early on in the scent notes. I'm typically not a powdery guy and actually tend to gravitate toward darker earthy scents but Monarch really knocked my socks off! I get little hints of the lavender and powder and a citrus all neatly rolled onto a bed of cognac and it's wonderful. As for the frag, I borrowed the bottle of Rose Santal that belongs to my wife. Definitely a unisex fragrance and I think it compliments Monarch well. Happy Saturday everybody!!",

Then added 3 or 4 more drops of water and you couldn't tell there was any soap there. I'm not sure if it's my hard water or just me. This soap is getting passed on to a brother that also wet shaves.

Ah, the joys of life in a somewhat northern clime...\n\nProduct Notes:\n\n* Razor / Blade: ATT gave a much better shave than the recently used RR Hawk V2. Closer, less neck irritation. The Hawk is probably getting benched. I have the Colonial General SS for heavy AC and the ATT Calypso for a light handle. The Hawk shaves worse than either of those others.\n* Soap: One of my favorite WK scents! Base is also in my top tier, though this particular example lacks the hops extracts that were later added to the DM tallow line. Still a great shave!\n* Brush: Nice handle shape and the generic two band here did a nice job. An unexciting brush, but a really great bargain with an unusual and ergonomic handle shape.\n* Post: Tons of menthol, pleasant citrus scent. Probably not worth the typical high Baxter pricing, but still very effective in soothing face.\n* Frag: This one is growing on me. I get the wood and flowers more over time, and less of the oil. Still a landmark in design, but now also one I find pleasant to wear as well.",

Smells pretty much as advertised: peach blossoms and fresh fruit. Lovely, but not something I feel like smelling all day long because I don't want to develop an unfortunate craving for peaches at this time of year. I could see this soap being a really popular choice for young ladies shaving their legs: it's fun and fruity and a little bit floral without smelling like an old woman's perfume.\n\nA bottle of Stirling's unscented post-shave balm just arrived in the mail yesterday, so I tried it out with the shave today. You really don't need much of this stuff - even a pea-sized blob seemed almost too much. It does take a while to work into the skin but if leaves your face feeling pretty nice. Nivea goop is easier to apply, but I'm not sure yet which one works better. Next time I shave I'll try to remember to do one side with Nivea and one side with Stirling and see if there's a difference. Side note: it really is rather scent-free. It doesn't even smell like \"unscented lotion\" to me. It just smells like nothing.\n\n**The shave:** After so many days of super-close shaves with this blade in my Tech, I decided I needed to try it again in my super-speed to see how the two razors compare. I think the SS is a little more forgiving and has a bit less blade-feel: I can get away with a little more careless pressure without developing razor burn, whereas I have to be very mindful while I'm using my Tech. The SS also gives me more audible feedback when it's cutting, which makes it easy to find the right angle. That said, the Tech is much better at cleaning up the hard-to-reach whiskers under the nose, and it seems to shave a little closer a little quicker.\n\nCloser quicker is handy, but were the final results any less close after some touch-ups? Nah, they're about the same.",

First time using Project Leather, and it isn't what I expected. Not at all like Leviathan or some of the other leather forward scents I've tried. Which, honestly, is great for me. Definitely a complex scent, but I pick up notes of Tobacco (more like the flowery tobacco in Merchant of Tobacco than pipe tobacco or others). The vanilla, oud, cardamom, and bourbon blend together for me but together make up a nice backdrop.\n\nIt's been an hour or two since my shave and my face feels amazing. Sri's aftershave is next-level. I still haven't tried WK toner or balm, but I need to.\n\nMy Pasha's Pride set arrived today. It smells fantastic off the puck, and I'm excited to give the Bufala base a whirl tomorrow.",

It was right there, and I liked the scent profile for a rainy day like today. 3 passes done quickly with a little clean up. Boom!\n\nI went with Black Fern today to switch it up a bit. I forgot about the menthol lol, but it's all good! Not a perfect match or anything but I'm cool with it!\n\nHope everyone is staying warm and dry!!!\n\nEdit: [Song of the day](https://m.youtube.com/watch?feature=youtu.be&v=BERd61bDY7k)",

It was very quick to lather and be shave ready. I know the soap is a dupe of tom ford tobacco vanille but I could only pick up heavy scents of the tobacco leaf and cocoa. With background scents of vanilla and I think some citrusy notes. With that said, I do like the scent. I'm not sure what I want to pair with it as an Aftershave yet but it could go very well with either a tobacco heavy or cocoa heavy AS.\n\nThis is my 2nd Tom Ford tobacco vanille dupe I own. The other being stirling haverford. If anyone knows of other dupes of the same scent I would love to know them. This is probably my favorite scent combo.",

But like I care. WK seems harder than most of my other artisanal soaps and as such I tend to underload initially. Especially with this brush. This particular brush doesn't pick up soap as readily as any of my other brushes. That trait may also explain why it releases lather more completely than any other brush I own. As a result I had to reload after two passes. And before you ask, I made sure my doors were locked so the lather police don't come and drag me away for reloading.\n\nGonna spend the day watching the snow melt.

This is her favorite that I currently have, and I really like it too. Also, first time using a Personna blade. It's ok. It was a little rougher to my face than Astras, Feathers, GSBs and Voskhods. But it got the job done, and it might smooth out after a few shaves.\n\nAnyways, Go Rams! I don't hate that the Patriots keep winning, but it would be nice to have a little variety. And, the Rams practice basically in my backyard.\n\nHappy Shaves Y'all.",

First broke onto the scene in 2007 and have been active and touring since then, even through some personnel shakeups, with the only constant members being the lead singer and the drummer. The album I listened to for this SOTD is their latest offering, released 06.02.2017, under Napalm Records, titled *Apex.*\n\n*Apex* is a 10 track album, clocking in at 60 minutes. Featured genres according to Wikipedia are heavy metal, power metal, and melodic metal. It opens with a track called \"Awakening,\" which has an excellent [playthrough video]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqUPGa15Oto) on Youtube, that /u/shredsofmetal linked me to. One thing I really appreciate about this video is that it doesn't focus on the female lead singer, Brittney Slayes (birthname: Hayes). Yes, she's attractive and there is a certain novelty of a metal band with a female lead singer but that isn't the point of the video. The point of the video is that these guys are damn talented musicians and Brittney can fuckin' *sing.* And but check out the fretwork at 4:22. Is there a term for that style of playing, way up on the frets like that? I'm not a guitarist (I'm a drummer) but he certainly appears capable. And the drummer does his thing well, his double-bass skills make me jelly. This track did make me excited to hear the rest of the album. Following are some of the moments that caught my eye. I mean ear.\n\nBrittney has a great intro howl on [\"The Matriarch.\"]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fs8RUFS18g0)\n\n[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfSL-6YExzk) is the music video for \"Cleanse the Bloodlines,\" which is kinda cool, featuring a falcon and the Canadian wilderness and a huge bonfire and some very dramatic nighttime silhouette shots. The title sounds like not-subtle wink at genocide but it's actually about a supernatural being that is also a mother but her sons are not supernatural enough and must be culled from said bloodline. I think. This album strikes me as almost trying to be a concept album but not quite. There is lots of storytelling involved but not enough song-to-song connections to make it a True concept album, in my opinion. This song and \"Awakening\" were the only ones to get music videos.\n\nExcellent guitar solo at 3:32 in [\"The Coward's Way.\"]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApPp0-20yZc)\n\nOne of my favorite moments on the whole album is during [\"False Walls,\"]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVuPIWd9xIw) at about 5:20, when the breakdown in the middle morphs into a half-time feel with soaring guitars and a great vocal melody.\n\nI would have to say that \"Ten Thousand Against One\" is probably my favorite track on the album. The double-bass and bass lines through the middle lend a great half-time feel and what I came to refer to as the Horde Chorus makes this track just a lot of fun. I wish they did a music video for this one, with some yuge epic battle scene.\n\nAnd for a complete change of pace, [\"Earth and Ashes\"]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpjLYqeWNYw) leads off with a very tasteful acoustic intro. Awesome drums on this track as well.\n\nFinal Thoughts: This was a fun record to listen to and I'm glad I went front-to-back. But I don't think I would listen to all of it again. I did, however, save a few tracks to my playlist. The lyrics are pretty dramatic and not that great, on the whole, but I don't think you really listen to this stuff to learn anything, per se. I think it's more about the whole experience. I bet they are so much fun to see in a live setting. As a musician, the music is the best part and I *do* include Brittney's voice in that statement. While the lyrics leave a lot to be desired, the music does not and I legitimately did enjoy this album. I can definitely see myself listening to another album of theirs. But I probably wouldn't put it on during my drive to work. Or anywhere, really.\n\n*Regarding the Frag:* Got my sample of this a few days ago. First Chatty Lux frag. This is the third time I've worn it and I absolutely love it but like. I can't really even articulate why. It's too complex. I mean, there's the lamp oil note, obviously. And usually, when I describe scents, I describe them in a way that indicates there is a *base* scent, that everything else sort of has to get around. But this Lamplight stuff doesn't strike me as being like that. Because it doesn't seem like a *base* note, it's more like the *starting* note. The lamp oil lasted for a bit and then it was something else entirely. And then a few hours later, it changed again. My nose has never really experienced a product that does that and in a way, this goes against everything nose has learned over the last thirty years. It's a borderline paranormal experience. This stuff shouldn't exist. On my first impression of Chatty Lux, I have determined that /u/hawns is a fucking insane fucking stark-raving lunatic scientist goddamn madman who appears normal and put-together but wanders the plains of Missouri and the banks of the Mississippi with a spear, in a bearskin cloak that he harvested himself, tripping whole sheets of acid and communing with the ancient Sky Gods of the Oglala Sioux tribe and they give him recipes for otherworldly and slightly dangerous fragrances to sell to weirdos on the internet.\n\nIt's the only thing that makes sense.\n\nAlso, which one should I get next? Expanding my olfactory horizons as well, here.\n\n*(Note: for an actual, intelligent and informed review of this frag, please see [this post]( https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/9q0u06/review_chatillon_lux_lamplight_penance/)\nby /u/watershitdown. It's probably one of the most thorough and well-written reviews I've read for any type of product on this sub.)*\n\n*Regarding the Superb Owl:* 51 days till Opening Day. March 28. Earliest one ever.\n\nHappy Monday, everyone.\n\nP.S. [February Reminder.]( https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/ab8bix/new_years_resolutions/)",

Great lather, smooth razor, and close cut. I think I've finally landed on my optimal Williams lathering technique.\n\n#### Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Gillette - Fat Boy Setting 5 ::: Feather ‹13 uses›)*\n\nExcellent combination.\n\nI had 2 days of growth, so I started out at a 5, expecting to reduce it on a subsequent pass. But it was so smooth-feeling that I just kept it there the whole time.\n\nNo irritation and no tugging, even though most people pitch their Feather blades long before now. What the older blade gave me was great cutting AND smoothness.\n\nThe Fat Boy holds the blade solidly, contributing to the comfort and smoothness, IMO.\n\n#### Soap Notes\n*^(Williams Mug Soap)*\n\nI want a method for Williams that flows with my regular routine, so all it took, after a lot of permutations: I soak the soap *gasp!* for a few mins in cold, and only enough water so that before building the lather, I can dump that into my lather bowl and have it be lather water. From there, it's pretty much standard.\n\nseveral min pre-soak in cold water on top of puck (2.5 tsp) + 20 sec load with a medium-lightly wet brush + 1 tsp water = 5 passes of slick, creamy lather! I like an extra pass or two for margin's sake.\n\nI put 2.5 tsp cold water on the soap to soak for several mins. Then that went into the lather bowl. So, no soap wasted!\n\nThe lather was just perfect! Creamy, while also being super slick.\n\n\n#### Brush Notes\n*^(That Darn Rob - Fanchurian 28mm 2-Band)*\n\nThis brush has become very enjoyable and soft. I don't like the fan shape as much as the bulb, but I like this handle.\n\n#### Shave Quality\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Smooth\n*Neck*: Smooth\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Cut flush to where I just see the tips (above average for me)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm)\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

I didn't feel anything at the time. So, I went back to the Rockwell today, which is basically a mindless shaver. Probably back to the Wolfman tomorrow.\n\nI really like Yeehaw. It has citrusy/floral scent that is very easy to wear. And, it's not overbearing, which I like. Good stuff.",

Dang.\n\n**The soap:** I like executive man. It opens with pineapple and... other stuff. Then the pineapple fades and it just turns into a pleasantly sweet, smokey, fruit, subtly floral fragrance. It keeps moving through a few more stages as the lighter fragrances fade off but it's all so complex that I have a really hard time explaining it. Also, I find that working my post shave balms into my face tends to wipe most of the fragrance off my skin no matter what I shaved with, so I've sort of lost my opportunity to experience the rest of this lovely fragrance for today. It's great though.\n\n**The shave:** Repeated Saturday's equipment setup, but pre-soaked and shaved with room temperature water instead of hot water to see what it's like. Hot damn did it ever go well. BBS everywhere (including problem spots) in 2 passes with a bit of touch-up, essentially zero irritation or razor burn. Fantastic! I'll give cold water another couple weeks to make sure today's shave wasn't just a fluke. Hopefully it's just one of those things that works for me and I can stick with it.\n\n**The post-shave goops:** I got the Stirling balm in the mail last week and gave it a shot. Seemed okay, but how did it really compare to the Nivea? No way to know without a side-by-side comparison... so that's what I did today: Stirling on one side of the face, Nivea on the other. I didn't actually have much razor irritation to work with today, so the balms are mostly soothing brush burn at the moment.\n\nThe Nivea is thinner and easier to apply, but my brush burn stung a bit upon initial application. The Stirling was harder to work in, but the brush burn didn't sting at all on initial application. Half an hour later, the Nivea side of the face just feels smooth and clean and normal and I'm not noticing the brush burn any more. The Stirling side of the face still feels a bit like it has recently has lotion applied to it and the brush burn is starting to creep up on me. Considering that the Stirling costs ~~3 times~~ 1.5 times as much and doesn't seem to be offering much benefit so far, I think I would personally pick the Nivea... but I'll see how it goes through the day and tomorrow and see if there's any difference in how the skin looks/feels later in the day.\n\n**Edit:**\n\n10.5 hours post shave. Both sides of the face feel pretty much the same. Upon reviewing my math I grossly miscalculated the price difference between the two products. Stirling is only 50% more expensive than the Nivea. When I look at the difference in the ingredient lists, I think I'd rather be applying the Stirling to my face... it has a bit more face food and fewer additives to control consistency, which makes me suspect that it's going to be better for my skin in the long run.",

The slickness, and protection are there, but it left my face very dry post shave. Im not in love with the scent so I may just give it to a buddy.\n\nThe Edwin Jagger de89 is my litmus test. It seems to be the constant i can use to find out how much I really like something. The polsilver super iridium blades have a comparable reliability.\n\nFor the first time in a while I didn't shave for a day. It did make this shave a bit more satisfying. I'm going to replace my arko with either my tabac, or proraso white as a workhorse soap. I will think about it for a couple days I'll test both and see which has the best post shave feel (I'm thinking proraso white, but I'll still compare the two)",

      "body": "Posting last night's shave. [SOTN - 2/3/19](https://imgur.com/a/ZpQMDaa)\n\nBrush: (H) Stirling 24mm 2-band synthetic / (F) Wild West 24mm B5\n\nRazor: (H) Gillette Guard (7) / (F) Rex Ambassador (2, 1.5)\n\nBlade: Polsilver SI (24)\n\nLather: (H) SBSW Coffee Spoons sample / (F) B&M Reserve Seville\n\nAftershave: B&M Reserve Seville\n\nThe Super Bowl may have been boring but my evening shave certainly was not. I had been on the fence about the Rex and could not pass up Maggard's recent promotion. Up until this point the most expensive razor in my den had been the Karve CB (traded my 6S on the bazaar for it) with a C plate and later picked up a B plate for it.\n\nMy first impression is a positive one. The razor feels great in hand and is well balanced. It also has excellent knurling and similar to the Karve, I love how the blade remains flat without any room for it to move.\n\nI got a fantastic first pass on the 2 setting and used a 1.5 for the second pass. Which gave me a DFS and almost BBS with just 2 passes.\n\nI love that I don't need to disassemble the razor in between passes to change any plates. The adjustment is easy and doesn't feel like it would change mid-shave. While I can adjust my Gillette Slim Adjustable mis-shave the butterfly opening makes the blade feel less secure than the Rex.\n\nI need a few more shaves before I can truly say if this is the best razor in my den but I certainly recommend anyone looking for a premium adjustable to check it out. The price may be steep but the quality and finish of the razor along with the lifetime warranty ensures it's one that will last.",

I'm reevaluating once again how I want to approach wet shaving. I had a good talk with my wife about this hobby, and though she supports me, she mentioned that she misses having a few scents that she \"associates with me\" rather than the constant scent schizophrenia. She has a valid point. I've now accumulated the full complement of Reserve soaps and aftershave splashes as of this past week, and what I love about them is not just the quality shave itself, but that they're scented lightly enough to pair with most fragrances and not be obtrusive.\n\nI'm very seriously considering keeping those six soaps/splashes, selling the rest of my stuff off, and putting the funds I normally allocate to wet shaving toward sizable decants of Creed's Green Irish Tweed, Aventus, and Silver Mountain Water - the three fragrances my wife loves the most. I can still feed that scent curiosity by grabbing the occasional sample or 10ml decant of something a little different in the niche fragrance world, but I wouldn't mind the idea of simplifying things significantly from day to day. We'll see.\n\nHappy Monday shaves, all.",

Our story begins last weekend when we were trying to figure out what to do with ourselves on Sunday afternoon and my wife suggested going to Canada. Well, the kids latched onto it, but by Sunday afternoon it's already too late to head north. At some point last week, my wife made reservations for Friday and Saturday night at Whistler and Amazon Primed some new snow gear for the 7-year old since we last went up to Whistler when she was 4. Friday afternoon, the teenbeast threw the first grader into the car and drove over to meet the wife and I at work. We all piled in and proceeded north. Whistler is roughly 4-ish hours north of downtown Seattle and we arrived around 10 Friday night. Saturday was beautiful with clear skies and temps in the mid-30s. The shortest human spent hours sledding, we took the gondola up Whistler, then rode the peak-to-peak gondola over to Blackcomb, ate some poutine, then rode back over to Whistler and back down. We finished the day off with an incredible steak dinner. On Sunday morning, we got up and began the trek southward. And the snow came with us. On the drive up, we didn't see a hint of snow until we were well into the mountains north of Vancouver. On the drive back, it never stopped snowing and there was snow on the ground all the way back to the house. We now have 3-4 inches on the ground. School is cancelled for the kids and the wife and I will be working from home.\n\nOn to today's SOTD. It was my first time using an ATT razor and I went with the R1 base plate since I had 3 days of growth to take care of. The first thing I noticed was that this is an extremely light razor. If you thought you were going to \"just let the weight of the razor do the work\", you might be waiting all day for it to slice through the first whisker. Razor weight aside, I found the R1 to be very efficient with a fairly intuitive angle and some nice audible feedback. The bamboo handle also felt pretty nice in my hand. As per usual, the NO soap performed admirably. At $4/ounce, NO is absolutely killing it on the quality/price ratio. Noble Otter is the best bang-for-your-buck soap in wetshaving today. Change my mind.\n\nOh, and last night after we got home, I also had time to shave my head. The C plate on my Karve razor mowed right through the however-many-days-it-was days of growth and the tester of Summer Break's new soap base continued to shine.",

Been working through my new razor collection that grew... extremely quickly... once RAD set in. Finally working through everything and giving each razor a week or so to get an initial impression.\n\nPretty good shave for a first use. I played around with some settings (started on 3, ended on 7). I might try it on a mid-aggressive setting with a blade like GSB and see how that goes.\n\nLove this soap. It smells fantastic and SW performs great. It builds a great lather so damn easily. Wish I had the splash.\n\nGave this Macaque EdP sample a go today. Thought the apple notes would make it pair.",

It surprisingly felt aggressive, with lots of blade feel. Take that with a grain of salt since a tech is my daily driver, but still. It's 51 here today in CT, so I took out a spring scent of Petrichor. Hit the spot, and it surprisingly mixes well with sandalwood.

This is my first foray into artisan soaps and what a difference they make. I was using random Amazon soaps ranging from TOBS to American Soap Company and they don't hold a candle to the Wholly Kaw. When I watched videos of people using it and heard them say \"you don't even need an after shave\" I didn't really listen much because I was so used to HAVING to use an after shave. You really don't need one with the King of Oud, it's incredible. I've never smelled something like this before and it made me look into Oud colognes because I want to smell like this all the time. The slickness I get from this is definitely 2 steps above the other soaps I've used, my face didn't feel raw by the 3rd pass and I was confident enough to go against the grain in trouble spots on my neck and only get a single little nick (down from 3-4 in those spots).\n\nThe only thing I've noticed is it definitely dried my face out and made it much tighter than some of my other soaps. Oh well, no product is 100% perfect.\n\nThanks for reading guys, I'm a big fan of Wholly Kaw now, keep up the great work to everyone over there!\n",

I think it's safe to say Noble Otter will have another hit with this soap. It's extremely well done, and the rose and oud notes are smooth. I'm not an oud fan, and the oud is blended in a way that it just adds richness to the scent without being funky. The best way I can describe the scene is sensual. It's a great Valentine's Day scent, but would work year round. I definitely recommend this scent!",

That or perhaps it's because it is easier to see that it's working. 2 swirls with the brush and suds are already forming, 15 seconds and I can hardly contain all the suds onto my brush. Loading any longer proves wasteful as it starts overflowing out of the container. However, when I used Leviathan over the weekend, I expected to load for 30 seconds (as is tradition) but I didn't see much evidence of soap on my brush. I added 15 seconds and then worked that into a lather. I was expecting to see the initial loading results I get from SS, and I probably ended up overloading because of it.\n\nEither way, I've grown to enjoy this base.\n\nLife is short, shave with good gear.",

This soap flies under the radar for the most part. It is a really good performing soap. My only complaint about it is that it has almost no scent. Not even a soapy scent. Still, that may be a plus for people that don't like heavily scented soaps. It's a very soft soap and I mashed mine down into a vintage OS mug from the late 50s. It takes very little load time compared to a lot of other soaps, but I like to really load heavy with this brush. The end result is always a nice clean shave.\n\nThe week continues.",

Mostly sunny, with a high near 57. Southwest wind around 10 mph. High tide at 11:32 this morning.\n\nFirst go with Baume.Be. It's a very nice cream. Smell reminds me of laundry detergent, even more so than MLS The Kraken does. I think I loaded a bit too much as lather was flying off the brush. Performance is great a nice amount of cushion, and slickness is great. There is a ton of residual slickness, but it doesn't take forever to rinse off, which is very nice. There have been soaps that residual slickness is great, but I spend more time that it took me to shave trying to rinse that feeling off of my face. Over all a great performer. Will go back to Cade tomorrow to see how it compares.\n\nHave a nice Tuesday everyone!",

VP & Fresca I can already see the bottom of the tubs so should go by quickly. Famous last words.\n\n\nFirst go with the Paladin this morning. When I first pulled the brush out, I immediately knew this brush was going to be good. Extremely soft tips and a good amount of backbone. The 2CLND3 reminds me of Declaration Grooming B2 hair but with more backbone, which is a great match for me. I wasn't a huge fan of B2 due to the lack of backbone and thus I've sold my previous brushes. Graphite resin is pretty killer too and pictures don't do it justice. The only other Paladin I've purchased was a 26mm 2CSLH4 and that knot, I'll be it soft, was just not dense or big enough for my taste. I'll say I'm not a huge fan of Paladins prices for brushes this size. Thankfully, I purchased this brush on the BST for almost half of the retail cost. Hell of a steal if you ask me. This brush I forsee staying in my den for some time.",

What's even better is each piece here has some meaningful connection to a person in the community.\n\nCole's Pond is the latest from Talbot artisan Chad Irish, and it did not disappoint. Loved the scent, and the performance is fantastic. The story behind the scent is about childhood connections with family, and resonates with me strongly.\n\nThe Wolf Whiskers I remember seeing in an auction and loving the look of it. It was too rich for me, but later a friend of mine was selling it and we worked out an awesome deal!\n\nFitD was the first scent in wet shaving I fell in love with, but I encountered it too late for the edt. I used the splash recently in my SOTD and mentioned I'd been wanting the edt, and /u/odenihy messaged me and sent me his as a gift!\n\nAnd finally you guys know I've been hunting a 1981 black beauty, and made sporadic WTB posts about it. Well /u/Ugmug was super generous and sent me this one! It's not a 1981, but it was awesome to get to try one out, it gives a great shave.\n\nListen, February is a tough month for a lot of us. Today I'm keeping in mind all the great folks I've met across the community in the past year. I'll be running a PIF later encouraging folks to share their stories of who's been kind to them. Feel free to reach out if you'd like to join me somehow.",

I haven't done anything different other than rinsing it after each use and letting it dry in between shaves. I may push it to 50 but 25 was the initial goal. I'll continue using it until it begins to tug.\n\nI dialed the Rex down to 1.5 and had a great shave. The razor is very efficient and my first pass almost got it done.",

      "body": "Tuesday 2/5/19 SOTD\n\n* Razor: ATT Windsor Copper R1\n* Blade: Gillette Platinum (1)\n* Brush: 21 mm Muhle Rytmo in ash handle\n* Soap: Ariana & Evans Asian Plum\n* Post: Nivea Deep Comforting Post Shave Lotion\n* Frag: LAP Dzongkha EDT\n\nHappy Year of the Earth Pig!!\n\nProduct Notes:\n\n* **Razor**: The Windsor shaves wonderfully, but the copper has patinaed in an unpleasant manner, lots of flyspecks on handle and head, not much of a \"vintage metal\" look. I may just polish this up again to get rid of the aesthetically deficient patina. No reactive metal razor I have has really patinaed well - either very minor and / or ugly. Soft water not the best for this purpose? Dunno.\n* **Blade**: First time use for Platinum. Jury still out. Seems less sharp than GSB or Yellow 7:00, but also much smoother than either. Got a two pass BBS with some work. Pricing may be the real problem with this blade, as it costs more than either of the other Gillette variants mentioned above. Let's see how long the BBS lasts and how many days the Platinum can last for.\n* **Soap**: Asian theme. A&E base performs pretty well, somewhere below Reserve and Eufros, somewhere above Noble Otter and Glissant. Scent is nicely done, a fruity tobacco. The soap has a mysterious brown spot on its surface now that concerns me a bit,\n* **Post**: Saw this new stuff at Target, picked it up, Should not have bothered! Though having alcohol in it, this \"lotion\" had less burn than the usual Nivea after shave balm, but the \"lotion\" was basically liquid, so I'd call it a splash. Scent was interesting, mildly powdery citrus, but the real issue is that Nivea insists that if you have dry skin, you absolutely cannot get by with only their post shave, so this \"lotion\" had very minimal moisturizing effect. Dry faced me had to put some moisturizer on afterwards to avoid becoming The Mummy by noon.\n* Unfortunately for Nivea, many other brands, at big boxes and elsewhere, offer one stop solutions for both post shave soothing AND longer term moisturizing (e.g. Cremo, Duke Cannon, Aqua Velva, PSC) so it wastes my time and money to use Nivea products. (Other traditional cosmetic brands like Neutrogena have the same issue.) So would not recommend, unless you and your face favor cheap splashes with minimal skin care formulations. This experience makes me appreciate how great B&M Reserve after shave is!\n* **Frag**: Dzongkha is meant to be an olfactory simulation of Bhutan - incense, stone, peony, and wood. Done by Duchaufour, but the critical folks on Basenotes consider this a lesser example of his genius. I like it anyway, and it suits today's Lunar New Year occasion.\n\n​",

With the 7oclock green, which I don't think I've used before, shave is way closer than with the Astras and GSB's I've been leaning on. Feather like close. Also first time use was the Summer Break splash. I'm a fan of the soaps and have used this one before. Now.... The splash burned like heck, like I was the kid from Home Alone. Passed after a few minutes and now I smell good with a close shave, 4 or 5 hours later.\n\nWhat I don't know is, is there just more alcohol in this than some of the other splashes I've been using lately (Chatillon Lux, Chiseled Face, Catie's Bubbles), was the Gillette 7oclock harder on my face than I realized, or less likely, did some fragrance cause it (less likely, no smells in here really I don't have in other splashes). Further testing must ensue. First up will be same blade tomorrow with a different splash (although it will be duller....)",

Trying Gatlinburg for first time.\n\n#### Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Razorock - Game Changer .85 - Medium ::: Feather ‹14 uses›)*\n\nGreat combo. Comfortable shave, but an excellent, close cut. The edginess of the feather is gone now, and it's just delivering great shaves, without any of the sporadic bite.\n\nNo tugging or irritation.\n\n#### Soap Notes\n*^(Stirling - Gatlinburg)*\n\nAwesome performance, as usual, from Stirling.\n\n1/4 tsp soap + 5.25 tsp water = 5 passes of wet, slippery, ultra-slick, protective lather. I wouldn't want it any wetter.\n\nScent: Got some great burnt wood notes when dry, but that disappeared to a more generic forest scent when in lather form. It was pretty good, but since I have Darkfall already, I don't feel the need to bring this Stirling into my cabinet. I enjoyed it as a shave soap scent, but I don't think I'd like this all around me for longer periods, in post-shave form.\n\nScent Strength: 5/10, nicely present during shaving.\n\nBlended nicely with Sharp Dressed Man balm.\n\n\n#### Brush Notes\n*^(Stirling - Boar 24mm Factory Seconds)*\n\nStill very scrubby. Didn't give me any brush burn this time, though.\n\n#### Shave Quality\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Smooth\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Cut flush to where I just see the tips (above average for me)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm)\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

It wakes me up in the morning and I feel like I'm in the mountain cabins, waking up to a ice freezing water. I love the MR1 but the blade was getting a bit dull for me. Time to change it out soon.\n\n**The Soap** I really love Proraso soaps. They're not the slickest but boy do they feel nice and protective. I can't shave areas without lather but I can get a great shave with them. I love the menthol and the Eucalyptus scent. One of my favorites.\n\n**The Razor and Blade** combination was decent. I like the razor but the blade is getting towards the end of its life cycle. I remember Wilkinson Sword blade being a lot better in the first couple shaves but now it was a bit rough for my liking. Still a good shave but a bit irritated in couple areas of my neck.\n\n**The Brush** was great. I'm enjoying the horse hair brush a bit more now that it is breaking in. However, compared to broken in boars and badger brushes, it is still more prickly and scritchy. I try not to push in the brush towards my face but it's still a bit rough in certain areas. I hope that as I use it more that it becomes softer.\n\n**The aftershave portion** was great. The Alum Block stung a bit more than the usual and I blame it on the blade. Great blade but I used it too much. But the Balm definitely soothed the slight irritation and I'm feeling great after. One of my favorite combination!\n\nOverall, a decent shave. I'm changing the blade for next time and I'll continue to break in the horse hair brush to my liking.",

Just an effortless and truly enjoyable experience. This 26mm is a much more dense and soft knot than the 25mm I first tried. Milton was great to replace it, and I now have another outstanding performer.\n\nDon't know why I ever stray from the E plate on the Karve. Mows right through everything without issue.\n\nBeen a great week in terms of purchases. Snagged a Charcoal Goods Lvl 2 and a ThatDarnRob Brush from his most recent drop. Slowly but surely checking off my list of favorite artisan acquisitions. Shant dare look at my bank statement this month however... Happy Hump day y'all!",

I picked up a [Popular Gold #46](http://www.mr-razor.com/Rasierer/One-Piece%20open%20comb/1939%20No46%20Popular.JPG) complete with original shipper last week. Razor showed up today and [this is what I was presented with](https://imgur.com/a/fCrU8fD). The knuckle head seller wrapped the shipper in brown packaging tape! The package was then opened by customs and since the box was taped shut, they ripped it open to inspect the contents. The box is now ripped in 4 separate areas with a large portion of one corner missing. The box is essentially ruined. Such a damn shame that something from the 30's was ruined because a knuckle head thought it'd be a great idea to tape it. Please keep in mind that I emailed them after I bought the item to please package it securely for international shipment, I received it all taped and wrapped in bubble wrap, no box.",

She was teaching him to live in the desert, and told him of a man he thought might've been his father who passed through and marveled at how she managed to scrape a small life in the constant sandstorms by herself. They dug our a portion of her home together, and I recall how smooth the walls and floor were, almost as if carved from stone. It was cooler inside then outside, but I don't recall the place seeming particularly warm. A desert at room temperature. The sands were a light tan color, the sky a perpetual sunset hue. The boy came to the desert through a forest where he grew up. He realized he was following his fathers footfalls when I woke.",

Nah, it's pretty much the same. There's a bit of citrus on top, but then everything underneath that sort of blurs together into a mild perfume and I have a tough time picking out any individual component. It doesn't speak to me and whisper \"wear me all day brah,\" but it also doesn't offend me at all. I won't be ordering this one again simply because there are other scents that I like a lot better.\n\n**The shave:** After having good luck with a cold-water shave and my Super Speed on Monday, I decided to throw this blade into my DE89 and see if cold water changed my opinion of this razor/blade combo. (I am not a fan of the pointy corners on the EJ head in general. I understand that they look classy as heck, but they don't agree much with my face.) Much like Monday, I got a mostly really close shave with essentially zero irritation. The DE89 didn't get as close under the nose as my Tech can and its stupid pointy corners still make it uncomfortable on the neck, but overall it was much more comfortable with cold water than it usually is with hot. Good enough.",

It takes everything I love about a Gillette Old Type and takes it up a notch.\n\nSure it has finishing issues and it takes a while to align the blade, but it's like an air cooled 911 or old Alfa, the flaws are outweighed by the feeling you get when you use it. Plus, it was $19 USD for a solid, weighty brass razor; you can't expect Wolfman levels of fit and finish for that price.\n\nShaving nirvana. BBS in two passes and one touch up. My skin always feels cool and slightly tingling with no irritation after using this razor. In terms of cost and performance, one of the best deals in wet shaving.",

It's very rose forward, which is something I like, but if you aren't a fan of rose, this soap isn't for you. It's rose, it's got some oud, and it's fantastic!",

Summer Break Picture Day has been the soap of the month so far. I used this for a head shave last night and a face shave this morning. I really like Summer Break soaps and they produce a really nice lather with good post shave. I actually forgot to use any aftershave this morning and my skin has been super dry, but I don't really feel any worse off for it, which is a good sign for the soap.",

Tried another Wickham scent.\n\n#### Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Timeless .95 - Scalloped Bar ::: Feather ‹15 uses›)*\n\nPerformed really well today. Excellent combo. Confidence inspiring. Felt little risk of cutting myself.\n\nNo tugging or irritation.\n\n#### Soap Notes\n*^(Wickham 1912 - Magnum)*\n\nSuch a great lather can come from Wickham. Took a good bit of water and worked well.\n\n1/4 tsp soap + 4 tsp water = 5 passes of well-hydrated, super slick and luxurious lather.\n\nScent: In the end not for me. Maybe it's the Lemon and Rosewood.\n\nScent Strength: 5/10, nicely present during shaving.\n\n\n#### Brush Notes\n*^(Zenith - B10 Boar Red)*\n\ncomfortable, giving no brush burn. Tips splitting slowly.\n\n#### Shave Quality\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Smooth\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Cut flush to where I just see the tips (above average for me)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm)\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

I'm finding that my *best* version of the Reserve lather comes with a damp synthetic brush that has been ringed out of any dripping water prior to loading. The soap goes on really pasty this way, like Elmer's glue, but opens up relatively quickly as water is liberally added to the brush for a face lather.\n\nPutting together pricing for a decent sized Bazaar sale that will include some great B&M sets and CL toners + EdT samples. Proceeds will fund a few larger decants of Creed fragrances I really enjoy, and some smaller decants of some Creed and Tom Ford scents I'd like to try.\n\nAfter a 10\" snowstorm last Monday and the bitter cold through the middle of last week, we've come full circle with 3/4\" of ice last night.

That warm, woody smell to me is classic.\n\nNow, I don't shave with Proraso or TOBS any longer, but have been looking and looking for a classic Sandalwood scent in a high-performing base.\n\nMy search is over. Santal Auster hits it out of the park for me. The Icarus soap base with the warm Sandalwood just had me smiling. Chatillon Lux adds accords that compliment the Sanalwood so well.\n\nI normally don't do 'backup' tubs of soap. I have one in my collection of around 60 tubs. But this will be the second. Such a great shave.\n\nThis was also my 6th shave with my new Declaration knot in a Dogwood handle. Absolute game changer. Soft tips with just the right amount of backbone and so dense. Such a great brush and I don't see me going back to any of the other brushes I have for quite some time.\n\nOverall, a fantastic shave.",

I wanted my favorite spring scent considering it was in the low 60's yesterday. It was the perfect weather.\n\nSecond time using this Feather blade. I'm getting used to it, but I can see where the hype comes from. It's not as forgiving as my usual Gillette Platinum. Ended up with a couple weepers. Also, I think it's safe to say the 620 is finally broken in. It was super soft, and I was able to get a crazy good lather. I'm glad I stuck with it.",

Didn't feel much during the shave but I saw couple blood after the shave. Razorock really rocks my socks even though they get some bad reps sometimes. Amazing products for great values.\n\n**The Soap** was great! I think Razorock soaps really is the go-to soaps for me. Always whips up a great lather and comfortable shave every time. The post shave can use some work but I can't complain. And the Classic smells of a sweet almond marzipan which smells more like Cherry Coke for me. Still a great light scent that fills my nose, only during the shave. No lasting scent but that's fine for me.\n\n**The Razor and Blade** combination worked really well for me. Sharp blade and smooth shaves. Hard to complain but I did get some weepers on my chin and neck. The open comb felt mild but on my skin, it tends to be a bit more aggressive than the usual 89 or 34C. Felt great but looked a bit worse than usual.\n\n**The Brush** was great. That small but stubby handle paired with soft but firm Tuxedo knot. Always a delight to use. Not much to say other than it is one of my favorite synthetic to use. I don't like the bigger knots or the small knots. I think 24mm is the best for my taste.\n\n**The aftershave portion** was decent. The Witch hazel didn't stop the minor bleeding as fast as I thought but it did work. The Bulldog Aftershave balm is something that I don't use to often because it squirts out too much at a time. It has a good medicinal/eucalyptus scent and a cooling effect on my skin. Feels great after couple hours.\n\nOverall, a decent shave. Looked a bit worse than how it felt. I'm thinking of ways to improve the shave but it does require some more thought. Maybe the Razorock soaps are not slick enough or that the Razor/Blade combo is a bit too rough? I felt no irritation but just couple weepers. Maybe I'll try this set-up one more time to see the result.",

Cracked it open for a nice whiff, yes, but took a brush to it? Nope. In fact, it's my first reserve soap I've lathered that wasn't a sample. I knew going into it there was a slight learning curve. I was careful not to overload, but my first attempt failed maybe because I took that advice too strictly. Only loaded 10 seconds but it just felt too watery and wasn't coming together. My next try, I loaded for 20 seconds and knew right from the start that I loaded enough (but probably too much).

I remember there was a massive gymnasium and I lots of sports were played. I offered to drive a girl to the dentist after a football game resulted in a chipped tooth, but in the setting of the dream I hadn't driven in ages. I was terrified to drive. We found my car in the parking lot, and I told her bluntly that I hadn't driven in ages. She was young, and I recall her face, scared, but she told me that she's have to pay 90$ to take care of the tooth with her parents insurance and she was scared to pay. I said I'd pay. It struck me that if she's worried about 90$ then her parents shouldn't be wealthy enough to be attending this school. She hugged me and we started to drive. Then I woke up.",

Not for sale. Rarely use it.\n\n\nThe brush is my travel one. I pulled it out just for Theme Thursday. Not for sale.\n\n\nThe soap and aftershave is the /r/wetshaving SE. You know, I'm just as much into clean scents as the next person, but this one doesn't really do it for me. I mean, I [*like*](https://imgur.com/a/zWHUtDq) it, but not enough to pull it out of the nether regions of my night stand. And to think I got two sets of this stuff. One set not for sale.\n\n\n**Thoughts:** Went for speed today. Not bad. Wish I didn't give myself a big gash on my lip [yesterday](https://imgur.com/a/gafZuIn). I'm not really even sure that I learned a lesson, other than \"[Don't fuck up.](https://imgur.com/a/X4XxTEI)\"\n\n\n\nEdit: I have two brands of blades that I love. I used a blade I've never tried before, in the spirit of the theme. I put a picture of a blade sampler in there because I grabbed from there today. It's a Vidyut Super-Max Platinum. Blade sampler not for sale, even though it's pointless to keep. Apparently it's only good for Theme Thursdays. Hopefully we have like 30 Lord-themed SOTDs coming up.\n",

The blade is beginning to get a bit tuggy, but I'm gonna try to push it to 7 at least just to see what happens. It's definitely a frugal choice, but it's hard to be frugal when the blades are so ridiculously cheap! As for the fragrance, my wife got me a two month trial thing from Scentbird and this was the second scent. I enjoy the bright tones but just wish that the scent lasted longer than the 3 hours at best I've gotten out of it thus far.\n\nI've got a phone interview for another job on my lunch break today. If I end up getting the job, I'll definitely miss the daily patient care that I do right now but it sure is hard to pass up another $15k or so a year that this job in sales would get me. That's a whole lot of extra soap over a period of a year!",

You know how when you're a kid and maybe you stink cuz of what you got into, didn't shower, leaked a fart, pooped your pants, etc. and someone near you in class just has to blurt out \"OMG what is that horrible smell? It's sooo bad!\"? Well, this was like that. Except I felt no shame because I knew I smelled dope and her nose is sus af. While it's not fun to get accused of smelling like a hobo all day, I mostly just feel sorry for her that she can't appreciate these smells. Anyway, so that led to Shaken today, which come to think of it, I don't even think the offended coworker is working today. Whatevs yo I'll still enjoy smelling myself as always. And as it turns out, I nailed the theme, so, suck it world!\n\nHappy Friday Jr.!",

He expressed interest so I loaded him up with what I wish my starter kit looked like. Fatboy and all. So my shave was with stuff I didn't give away. (Sort of the theme?)\n\n\nWith working full time and Cosmo school at night, I don't have time to mindfully build my lather the way I enjoy. I'm learning the shower shave.\n\n\nI loaded a damp brush and set it on the shower edge. I washed up and and put my cleansing conditioner in my hair. No shampoo for me. My curls will fro out. Worked up a quick face lather and I just love how well Stirling performs. The steam from the shower combined with the Stirling and wet skin makes for a slick, comfortable shave.\n\nI'm new to the shower shave and face lathering. It's a good process and I'm left with a smith face and zero irritation. It's gonna be a great day.",

This is a scent that I love, but it is somehow also not really my thing. Regardless, I'll never sell it because it smells awesome. The Old Type is one of several razors I have that belonged to my grandpa. It's also probably my least favorite razor in my collection, but obviously it's not going anywhere. Finally, my trusty Perfecto. It's not going anywhere because it was my first brush, plus I'd have to pay one of you to take it. I will say it felt wrong using the Perfecto with Icarus, especially Santal Auster.",

I knew nothing about the company then but it sounded interesting so I bought some and fell in love. A hurricane ravaged the land where an ingredient comes from so other than what will be made and auctioned off for charity for the farmers there, no more can be made.\n\nThe Hucklaration was my first high end brush and opened my eyes to high quality badger hair and the talent of brush makers like Huck. One of ten in this hair/handle combo I think.\n\nMagazine Repeating Razor Type A first appeared almost 100 years ago. Very comfortable to hold and use, I wish I had one in better condition. IMO, little more blade feel than the B and C, it's still a great razor.",

I like my other razors a little more, but this one is still a great razor. Smooth and mild, with just enough blade feel to know that it's cutting.\n\nBrush - My first brush was a cheap piece of garbage from amazon. Once I did a little research, I got my Omega 10049. Some say it's too big for face lathering, but I disagree. It's got just the right amount of backbone with a little scrub to be a truly wonderful boar brush. I used this brush every day for months before I got my Stirling synthetic brush, which is what I use most days now.\n\nSoap and Splash - Flowers in the Dark is my favorite lavender scent, and lavender is my favorite \"scent family\" in wetshaving. So, this scent really is the best of the best for me. Unfortunately, it's seasonal, so I have to dole it out sparingly lest I run out.\n\nFrag - I got into fragrances through wetshaving. Especially through the (now defunct) fragrance Friday splits. This scent was pretty early on, and it was the first scent I was absolutely crazy about. A bottle is (I thought at the time, ha!) absurdly expensive, but I found a legit 50 mL bottle on eBay for a good price. I use this stuff sparingly, since I want the bottle to last my entire life. It's also pretty solidly a cold weather scent.\n\nSo that's my stuffs. I hope everyone had as much fun with this Theme Thursday as I did.",

[SOTN - 2/6/19](https://imgur.com/a/o42ekcp)\n\nPre-shave: CL Pre-Shave Butter\n\nBrush: (H) Maggard Razors 22mm synthetic / (F) Omega 4033\n\nRazor: (H) Gillette Guard (10) / (F) Klas Tornblom 5/8 FB\n\nLather: (H) SW Sandalwood sample / (F) B&M Diamond\n\nPost: CL Unconditional Surrender salve\n\nI kept to today's theme with last night's face shave. Notes on each item below.\n\nPre-Shave: I used to use CL's Pre-Shave Butter quite a bit but weaned myself off of it by dialing in my lathers (loading more soap/adding more water). It's still great but would probably reserve it for a few of the non-artisan soaps.\n\nBrush: The Omega 4033 is my boar travel brush. It may look small but it packs a punch with a 24mm knot on a very small handle. I like how the bristles are more densely packed than my other two boar brushes.\n\nRazor: I've only had a handful of straight razor shaves and I'm not ready to give up on it quite yet. I got a decent shave going slow and steady. I definitely need to get more straight razor shaves under my belt before I'm fully comfortable with my technique. I don't see myself using straights full time, I still prefer DE, but it's fun to change it up every once in awhile.\n\nLather: I give a lot of credit to Will for branching out with his scents. Diamond is not my favorite but I do enjoy using it from time to time. With football season now over there's only 49 days left until opening day.\n\nPost: CL's salves are fantastic and UC smells great to me. Unfortunately my wife does not share the same feelings, which is why I don't use it as much. A little goes a long way and I used a bit less than normal. It still made my skin feel great, especially after the straight razor shave, and I didn't hear any complaints.",

Such a clean scent. Unfortunately I always have a slight reaction to it which sways me from it. Still one of my all time favorites.\n\nNext blade on the chopping block is Personna, which in every way possible was a healing pile of garbage for me. I would probably have been better off shaving with a knife than this blade. A hard no from me. But ass they say, YMMV\n\nNot sure what to think of this brush. It can't hold lather so it falls down the handle. The third pass always seems too thin. But it's a nice painter brush, but isn't the best when splayed. I'm not sure if it's broken in or not. Maybe I just have to use it for a solid month straight with no breaks or something and see what I can do\n\nAlmost to Friday, happy shaves everyone!\n\n\n",

The lather was good. As good as DG or WK but no unicorns jumped out of it. It's a Barbershop scent in that the scent is very light to almost not there. I had listed the Kaboom earlier but the more I took the cap off the more I decided I wanted to try to bootleg a toner out of it. I haven't done that yet but with enough water on my face it was fine today. In fact the wife specifically asked what I had shaved with today. I'll definitely look into adding glycerin or something else to it. It's pretty strong too. Rod if you're listening and willing a toner would be awesome.",

Used a piece-meal razor configuration recommended by a friend.\n\n#### Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(FrankenRazor - Fatip Open Comb - Gillette Old Type Top Cap Open Comb ::: Feather ‹16 uses›)*\n\nTo be able to use any handle, a friend told me that you could put an Old Type top cap on a Fatip bottom plate and use any standard handle with it.\n\nVery aggressive when I tried it at the usual angle. I raised the handle outward a bit and it was a little better. Then on the 3rd pass I went the other way and brought the handle in closer. This was a bit noisy and scrapey, but I think a little better. However, while uncomfortable, this configuration gave me excellent results in just 2 passes.\n\n#### Soap Notes\n*^(Cella)*\n\nTub-load notes (small comfy Boar): 40 sec load with a lightly wet brush + 4 tsp water = gave me an extra pass or so. But the lather was too wet. Just 3 tsp of water probably would have been about right. It looks like with Cella, I don't need to get the lather super elastic for it to work right on my face.\n\nTub-load notes (soft silvertip badger): 45 sec load with a lightly wet brush + 3 tsp water = gave me an extra pass or so. Lather was protective and enjoyable. Funny how much of a difference changing brushes makes.\n\nTub-load notes (with dense 2-band badger): 40 second load (with this brush, at least) is about right. This lather might have been spot on. Seemed a bit too dry, but I think that is just the way Cella is. Any wetter, and I start losing creaminess and glide. A lightly wet brush used during load and less than .5 tsp of water for the lather. Might just be a model lather for Cella.\n\nPast scooping notes: Try 1/8 tsp or so next time. 1/4 tsp gave me 3x as much lather as I needed. But that day it looked hot!\n\nScent was great and about 4-5/10 for strength. Nice and present during shave.\n\n\n#### Brush Notes\n*^(Semogue - 1800 Boar)*\n\nI like this comfy little brush, and to be so at such a young age. Very nice.\n\n127mm Lather Bowl - 3D Printable\nhttps://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3392930\n\n#### Shave Quality\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: A little irritating\n*Neck*: A little irritating\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Cut flush to where I just see the tips (above average for me)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm)\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

The sample came very generously donated from the 2019 Paste & Cut Meet-Up Sample box. It didn't say if it is the tallow or vegan version, but judging from the [nice lather](https://i.imgur.com/wmiVKmI.jpg) and the ease of lathering, I would guess vegan. The scent reminded me very much of Mike's Hungarian Lavender - all in all a lovely shave.\n\n\n\n**I hope you all have a fantastic Friday**",

One thing I was struck with using it today is the fact that it very well may have the greatest storage vessel for soap ever created.\n\nHear me out. The porcelain Tabac bowl looks good, has heft in your hand, and has a naturally loose lid to let moisture out. But more importantly than all that it's quite deep, allowing for ease of loading like no other tub I've ever used. Truly a great bonus to this solid product.",

My 2 weeks notice feels forever long ago but today is the day I've worked so hard for and some. Today is the day I move from the lower ranks to the big boy league. Today is the day I no longer can IRC all day with my friends and will be serving customers with serious problems. Today is the day I will make a big change for my career.\n\nBut first, the weekend!\n\nHappy Friday All!",

Read on...\n\nLast night was truly one of the worst shaves I've had in years. No cuts, but a number of very healthy weepers that left me looking like I'd just fought a feral cat. It was an absolute WTF shave that made no sense, thus my extreme and excessive use of post shave products. This morning I seemed no worse for wear and tear, but damn last night was a mess. Terrible shave, but it happens on a rare occasion. Good day gents and TGIF.\n\n\n",

Strong juniper opening and then it fades into a sort of Spanish Cedar scent. Crazy how bergamot, jasmine, and patchouli can combine to do that. I like this one for its woodiness; hopefully my wife isn't allergic to it.\n\n**The shave:** Gave the cold water a try with my Tech. Nice BBS in 2 passes, only a little irritation where I used too much pressure on my chin. Pretty happy. Tugging from the blade is starting to get unpleasant now though - it doesn't just feel like scritching whiskers pleasantly with fingernails anymore. I think 10 shaves is about the comfortable limit for these German Wilkinson blades if I'm chasing the BBS dragon with them, based on the last couple I've used.",

A little rough on the first pass. My first try with Fine Platinum, and the soap did really well.\n\n#### Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Gillette - Aristocrat 15 OC - UK ::: Feather ‹17 uses›)*\n\nI experimented with angles in the first pass, since it was a little aggressive, not what I'm used to from a 15. But I think it was just a lather that wasn't wet enough for my skin to be protected well enough. Plus, it's still a Feather after all. But no irritation lasted beyond that first pass.\n\n#### Soap Notes\n*^(Fine Accoutrements - Platinum)*\n\nCrazy slick as usual.\n\n30 second load with lightly-wet brush + 4-ish tsp water = 6 passes of lather. I didn't add nearly enough water, so the first pass was a bit messy as I worked it out.\n\nScent: Wonderful Aventus type hit me during most of the rinses.\n\nScent Strength: 3/10, barely present during shaving.\n\n\n#### Brush Notes\n*^(Stirling - Boar 24mm Factory Seconds)*\n\nscrubby little sucker. waiting for it to grow up!\n\n127mm Lather Bowl - 3D Printable\nhttps://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3392930\n\n#### Shave Quality\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Cut flush to where I just see the tips (above average for me)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm)\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

Lather had the sheen and was slick while wet but after shaving an area it would dry and loose any residual slickness. If I slapped a little water on it that seemed to wake it back up. I still don't have this base dialed yet. I guess 125 swirls next time. I did get a small weeper this morning during the XTG pass but it's also day 8 on this blade. I'm trying to see how far I can push this blade in February. I think my rushing and the blade are more to blame than the lather. The kiddo smiled when I said good-bye this morning.",

This was the very first razor that got me into wetshaving. I have it in my travel kit for now because it is so easy to carry around. I think eventually I will move it back into the den because of how much it means to me. My grandma gave it to me for Christmas in 2017, saying that it was her grandfathers. She passed in June of 2018, so having it around and using it always reminds me of her.\n\nHappy Shaves Y'all!",

This razor is much more to my liking than the SB version, which is far too mild for my liking. I took a chance grabbing it in that it may still be too mild, but I'm glad I took the chance! The handle is too long for my liking, but that's an easy remedy.\n\nThis razor likes to sing! Loads of audible feedback, almost as much as a gem style SE haha. The angle is much flatter than any other razors I own, the handle is more perpendicular to my face.\n\nOverall a fantastic shave, BBS cheeks and jaw, a little more left over in my problem areas, but I can remedy that next go, I was a little over cautious there.\n\nHope everyone is having a nice Friday!",

For those that haven't tried it. Darkfall has this wonderful, spicy oriental overtones and when it mellows you get fallen leaves, wood, amber and cinnamon. It's not a daytime scent. This is something you wear when your going out for the night. It reminds me a little of Dolce and Gabban \"The One\". Its seriously good stuff.\n\nCheers!",

Got the new test base in from Oz Shaving today, so used it. Repeated same razor and blade as yesterday.\n\n#### Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Gillette - Aristocrat 15 OC - UK ::: Feather ‹18 uses›)*\n\nSo, yesterday's shave was a bit rough, and I found out part of the reason. On one side of my razor, the blade was not being clamped down consistently and in a straight line.\n\nIt worked better today, because I did some gentle tweaking. I may try more later, but with this precious of an item, I want to be conservative and cautious.\n\nNo tugging or irritation.\n\n#### Soap Notes\n*^(Oz Shaving - Tester Base 2-8-19)*\n\nNice slick lather, that was borderline too-wet. But if I dried my face off between passes, it was very nice.\n\n1/4 tsp soap + lightly-wet brush + 3 tsp water = 4 passes of slick, creamy lather.\n\nScent: maybe a vanilla or kitchen/food type smell when in dry form, but that disappears when wet. A center green/floral note comes out if I stick my nose in the lather bowl, but is almost imperceptible when lathering.\n\nScent Strength: 2/10, not really present during shaving.\n\n15 mins after the shave, my face felt fine. No drying or anything. And several hours later, when I woke up (since I\"m a night shaver), my face still had a nice silky feel. He's definitely got some post-shave goodies in there.\n\n\n#### Brush Notes\n*^(Zenith - B10 Boar Red)*\n\nLove this nice, dense boar that has gotten comfortable very quickly.\n\nLather Bowl 127mm - 3D Printable\nhttps://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3392930\n\n#### Shave Quality\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Cut flush to where I just see the tips (above average for me)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm)\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

My early experiences w/ creams were not that great (face lathering). Once I gave bowl lathering a try, it was a whole different ballgame. The synthetic builds mounds of lather and doesn't hog any of it--had enough for 5-6 passes if I wanted. The sandalwood scent is subdued but very pleasant--post shave still lags a bit behind my favorite soaps. 4th and Pine was my icing on the cake. I'm not really an EdT guy but if this one is available in that form I might pick it up. Wouldn't mind having this scent following me around all day. Pairs wonderfully with a brisk, wet morning (pre-dawn rain, but the sun is out in full force now). Happy Saturday.",

The USPS made their rounds around 12. By 1:00, the roads were starting to turn white, but still totally drivable. By 6:00pm, there was a good inch of snow on the roads. Now it's 9:00am on Saturday and there's at least 4 inches out there. I'm glad this beauty of a brush made it here before the snow did.\n\nGood shave this morning. I was honestly a little hesitant to try the Speedway razor, but I knew I had to do it *For Science*. It's a decent little shaver. More blade feel than I'm used to, but didn't produce any weepers. I tried to give Dr Jon's Anne Bonny splash another go, but it burned me up again so it went into the drawer of stuff that needs to find a new home. Finished up with some nice soothing CL salve.\n\nI really enjoyed my first shave with the B4. The ebonite has a different feel in the hand than DG's usual material. I can definitely see how this batch is getting lots of comparisons to B7. It's got a fair amount of backbone without being scrubby and while it's soft, it's not gelly like B6 or angel soft like B5. It is in no way an extreme knot.",

Started off very grapy but opens up a lot with a dry down the does indeed remind me of something of the Bach and Beethoven era.\n\nWife can surprisingly tolerate it but aftershave scent strength is too strong for her and the little man. May actually have to go mild for aftershave products.\n\nFirst 2 days of new job training down. Got a bunch to go. Just checked out w new preschool for the toddler. We both agreed this one is better than our current one and will likely switch this coming year. Anywho have a good weekend everyone.\n\nPS wife finally found a soap she loves. Shannon's soaps Amaretto lol in case you were wondering",

It's slightly thicker, and polished.\nI've managed to get a better shave on my problem areas today, I think partly to the handle being more manageable for me, longer handles seem to get in the way for me.\n\nOverall a DFS by any standards, BBS cheeks and jaw, and that's all I can hope for!\n\nHave a nice Saturday, folks!",

I don't know why but it just felt really great today. Not a BBS shave but a irritation-free and clean looking shave. A bit of stubble left isn't going to kill anyone.\n\n**The Soap** was great! The scent is definitely a polarizing and when I first smelled it, it disappointed me. I smelled Arko and got a headache after its industrial cleaner scent. Derby smells almost like Arko except that it smells a bit better, somehow. It has a bit more earthy and soapy scent rather than industrial cleaner. Some might not notice but it doesn't give me a headache and that's good enough for me. The lather is amazing. Creamy and protective but I do need to get a good amount of soap. I face lathered with the stick first and then loaded the brush with the stick. Doing both gave me a great pasty lather and adding more water produced the slick and creamy lather that I wanted.\n\n**The Razor and Blade** combination was great despite its last shave. Last time, I had couple weepers on my chin and neck but this time, I had nada, zero. I'm wondering if it's because of the soap; is Derby stick really better than Razorock Classic? Now that I think about it, it might give a more protective lather. I might have to try the Classic setup one more time.\n\n**The Brush** was wonderful. I thought that the two-band badger was going to be softer but it did start off a bit rougher than usual. As I added more water and created the lather, it became a lot softer and I really enjoyed the face lather. One of the best brushes that I have and I hope to use it for the years to come.\n\n**The aftershave portion** was good. Nothing to complain about. Nice and smooth skin.\n\nOverall, a great shave. The razor/blade didn't give me any trouble or irritation. Derby soap does not have the best scent but it does have some unique notes. Something about it still attracts me. Anyways, a fantastic shave and I hope to do an another one soon!",

This thing makes a DFS super low effort. Just as I expected it performed remarkably with a feather blade.\n\nI've always found feather to actually be very very smooth. I've never gotten why these blades are considered as aggressive or rough by some. It is very much a ymmv thing.\n\nThe fragrance is a great aventus clone. I highly recommend if you have a small budget but have a need for aventus this one is for you.",

Today I have the pleasure of using Philips Fougere. This is my all time favorite green scent. Grass, fir, oak moss, lavender and coumarin all come together in a really lovely, clean, fresh scent. This soap is pretty special to me for another reason though. It was a gift from /u/Ugmug who saw that I was running low on some during the furlough a few weeks back and gifted me a set. The offer came out of the blue and it reminded me of how grateful I am of this hobby and the people who share a love of wet shaving.\n\nCheers!",

One of my fav combos. Second run with the new tester base from Oz Shaving. It seems to be a good base.\n\n#### Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(RazoRock - Mamba ::: Feather ‹19 uses›)*\n\nMan, I love this combination! Like an obedient lion, you get crazy power, but you don't get bitten.\n\nSuch a smooth shave. No tugging or irritation. Though I did get one little weeper, but I never felt it sting afterwards, even when applying the alcohol-based splash.\n\n#### Soap Notes\n*^(Oz Shaving - Tester Base 2-8-19)*\n\nNice slick lather with good cushion, that was hydrated a little better today.\n\n1/4 tsp soap + lightly-wet brush + 2.5 tsp water = 5 passes of slick, creamy lather.\n\nScent: maybe a vanilla or kitchen/food type smell when in dry form, but that disappears when wet. First use: A center green/floral note comes out if I stick my nose in the lather bowl. Second use: some kind of refreshing note is coming through, maybe in the mint family, or some zesty conifer. It's like I can feel, but not smell it. If it's menthol, it's very light.\n\nScent Strength: 2/10, not really present during shaving.\n\nLather Bowl 127mm - 3D Printable\nhttps://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3392930\n\n\n#### Brush Notes\n*^(Semogue - 1800 Boar)*\n\nThis guy just has 5 shaves on it now and it's super comfortable and splays nicely. But still enough scrub to do the job.\n\n#### Shave Quality\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Smooth\n*Neck*: Smooth\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Cut flush to where I just see the tips (above average for me)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm)\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

I still get the big hit of leather and gasoline at the open, but as it begins to fade, I start to also pick up on plastic and vanilla in a way that compliments each other well.

Serves me right going to fast on auto pilot. Too many variables changed, new blade + aggressive head = nasty cut. I shaved down betweend my nose and mouth and in one motion started a stroke below my mouth. That was a mistakr. I now have a flap of skin under my lip because the blade went in about 2mm deep. So much blood the lather would've been quite pink if ai didn't contain in. I used an entire alum stick (thanks Rockwell swag) to form a kind of paste over the whole area. 10 minutes later the flap is sealed but the whole site is swollen.\n\nThe rest of my face is a DFS, it was a nice blade.

By the time I get it to splay on my face I only have about half an inch of room I can move it before it's getting uncomfortably close to my eye. I'm starting to regret this purchase. I might have to give this brush to my wife for her legs.\n\n**Soap thoughts:** This is the first shave soap I've tried that gave me a headache. It's a weird one to me: powdery, but not like baby powder. A little vanilla and rum, but not much. Just a hint of amber. Can't notice the musk. Definitely going to have to PIF this one to my shaving buddies and see what they think, because I just find this one gross. It's disappointing.\n\n**The shave:** Been a few months since I used a Derby Extra, thought I should give it another go since I switched up my routine a bit and see how it handles now. Even using every trick in the book, I was unable to smooth out my trouble spots. I could feel this blade tugging *with the grain*. The German Wilkinson Sword blades never felt that dull... not even after 15 shaves. I'm going to give this blade a chance in my Tech and my DE89 to see if it works better in a more aggressive razor before I write off Derby Extra forever.",

One thing about my first use yesterday was I don't think I worked the lather enough or added enough water so while the performance was great I think there's even more potential! The scent is a fairly complex like/citrus based scent that matched well with the post shave products I used.\n\nEnjoying the dual comb with my typical two pass shaves, open comb with the grain and closed comb against the grain. Been getting some of the best shaves ever! It's a good sweet spot between efficiency and smoothness.\n\nI rediscovered YRP this shave, and realized that historically I was probably using too much of the CL toner that could make the scent a bit overwhelming. For the toner, make sure to use a little less than a regular splash!\n\n\n",

I really like the feel of the handle on this one. It's heavier than my previous ball-end Tech and the fullers help with grip. Perhaps this will be the razor that goes out for Delta Echo treatment.\n\nI said last month that I'd be killing this tub of Ghost Town Barber this year and I haven't shaved with it since. That's not a good way to go about killing tubs. I'm going to have to start doing GTB weeks or something.\n\nAnyway, still trapped under 6+ inches of snow. Unlikely to get out of the house today unless it's to play in the snow with the smallest human. She *LOVES* snow.",

I went with a 2 pass shave today because, well just because =P\nA 2 pass is totally acceptable for a Sunday, and this razor provides an acceptable shave for any day with 2 passes, so I went for it =) I'm going to try another handle tomorrow, a Stainless WRH7 if I remember to bring it in the shower. One of the attributes of this razor is that it's heavy. The shape of the top cap has guards over the sides of the head, which enclose the blade. It's gorgeous to look at machining wise, but will add weight. I've been using a lot of Ti razors recently, and adjusting back to a heavier razor is a little weird, but I like a challenge =)\nAnother attribute I'm noticing is that while this razor shaves closely, it isn't very good for shaping facial hair such as mustache...the covered sides of the blade make it a little more difficult to navigate just how much or little you're taking off. This isn't anything that I or anyone else couldn't adapt to, just something I'm noticing with a little more use.\n\nAnyhow, DFS and there's no rain today!!\n\nHope everyone had a great Sunday!\n=)\n",

It really did not disappoint at all. I really really love it. The soap base is incredible, and the scent really impressed me. The aftershave really sealed the deal though. While the scent to me was floral and citrusy, which I absolutely adore, the aftershave really brought out the sandalwood, vanilla and musk to my nose. I am intoxicated by the smell, and the wife likes it too, so it's definitely a keeper!\n\nHUGE thanks again to u/Hyvasuomi79 for putting this incredible PIF together!!\n\nHappy Shaves Y'all!",

Ive got about 4-5 days of growth from the week but this setup had no problems slicing through everything. I got Monarch about two weeks ago but haven't used it yet and I was a little nervous, it wasn't a scent my girlfriend liked off the puck, to me it smelled like a grape jolly rancher. When I lathered it up the grape smell disappeared and I got a pleasant aroma of orange, hyacinth, and vanilla. This is my first dogwood handcrafts brush and it's fantastic, I had no difficulties getting a thick smooth layer that was the consistency of whipped cream. Post shave I opened up the aftershave which didn't have any of the grape smell from the puck but instead was floral and light sandalwood.\n\n\nOverall this was a fantastic shave and post-shave my girlfriend was pleasantly surprised by the scent, she didn't know I had used the one she said she didn't care for but she's a convert for sure now.",

Having used a tester base from Oz Shaving over the past two days, it was time to finally try his \"regular\" base in a soap I already had. Really enjoyed it.\n\n#### Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Gillette - Fat Boy Setting 3 ::: Feather ‹20 uses›)*\n\nWhat a great combo! At a mild setting, the Fat Boy controlled the wild Feather to deliver a superbly close shave, while being fantastically comfortable. All you have to do is find that sweet-spot handle angle that still keeps you cutting efficiently. Looks like I managed to.\n\nNo tugging or irritation. At. All.\n\n#### Soap Notes\n*^(Oz Shaving - Tornadic)*\n\nSlick, protective and fast lather! I like this base!\n\n1/4 tsp soap + lightly-wet brush + 3 tsp water = 5 passes of lather.\n\nScent: Kind of a generic aquatic. But nice and refreshing. Enjoyed it.\n\nScent Strength: 3/10, very lightly present during shaving. Wished for it to be a bit stronger. When lathering with the brush, though, it would spike to be more enjoyable.\n\n**If anyone wants to try out this Oz Tester Base, and report your findings back to the Wizard, then PM me and I'll send mine to you. This new base is along the lines of Icarus, and my sample has 3-5 more uses in it.**\n\n(Though I used the 140mm version, whcih I just received today, I don't have those files yet. So here's the one to base mine on...)\nLather Bowl 127mm - 3D Printable\nhttps://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3392930\n\n\n#### Brush Notes\n*^(Semogue - 1250 Boar)*\n\nA good brush. A little scrubby right now, and not as comfortable and smooth as the 1800. They are both at about 5 uses. I'll be interested to see if this comparison holds up once the tips really start to split later on.\n\n#### Shave Quality\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Smooth\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Cut flush to where I just see the tips (above average for me)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm)\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

Do you like trees? Do you like smoke and ash? Then I have a soap for you!\n\nIn all seriousness, I love samples because I can get a little crazy with them. Case in point is my puck of *Forest Fire* **^(TM)** that I made combining two 1oz samples of Stirling into an empty tub. I don't know if I would call it good, but as someone who just got done living through the California wildfires, the scent is unmistakable and I think it could be really popular to some folks here.\n\nIn other news I'm planning to sell my first razor, a Merkur 34c. I love my Maggards MR3, but I want to add something new to the collection to let me switch it up a little bit. I'm thinking about a Rockwell 6s or a Gamechanger. I'm not sure.\n\nCheers!",

Lately I have had them set out, but have changed my mind at the last minute. Today followed that trend. It's been a minute since I have used Dr Jon's. This was one of the very few blind buys I have made. It is a pleasant scent. My only complaint is that the scent strength is on the weak side for this particular scent. My tub of Black Label is stronger scented. The V2 base is well established and it has always performed well for me.\n\nOff to start another week.",

It's just such a smooth and rich scent. The scent is rose forward, but it's not just rose. It has enough richness from the other scents that it's something everybody (even non-rose fans) could enjoy, but at the same time I think if you're a rose fan this is a must buy.

After two shaves, Personas clearly aren't the winner. One more shave and I'll move on to my next contestant. From what I've read before, Don Donato is supposed to be an absinthe-esque scent. Never smelled absinthe before, but this is rather alcohol heavy, and the missus loves it, so no complaints there. I reckon this pairs very nicely with Laureato.

The top notes and off the puck scent make it moderately bright and open. More of the black current and citrus and lucky for me not noticing the Jasmine. And evolving into the darker side ,drying down into incense, carnation and some other scent I'm not sure of..maybe the oud.\n\nWell done scent that doesn't leave me feeling like I took a bath in fragrance oils and wanting to hurl\n\nNoble otter performance is as great as usual.\n\nOff to hospital orientation for the new job.

This splash does not do it for me. It lit me up even with a moderately wet face and the dry down reminds me of a pinaud clubman splash instead of TF's T&V. Pretty sure a colleague coughed and sneezed in the break room because of my potentially hobo vibe going on. This contrasts with my using Unconditional Surrender on Saturday which smelled like an oatmeal cookie to the wife and I didn't get any insecticide vibe from. I only used the soap though. I guess I'll try Stirling's Haverford balm next to see if that goes a little better.",

They have the more aggressive prewar head, along with a solid handle a lot like the ball end.\n\nu/fuckchalzone (check the link) I was able to get that much off with a scouring pad. I'll get it a little more thoroughly sometime this week\n\nAlthough this is my first shave with this razor it has moved to one of my favorite razors. It's pretty much the perfect tech for me.\n\nThis was also my first time using this post shave balm. It has a nice cooling sensation, and does a great job soothing. It's as good as any other aftershave I've tried it's the first that uses hemp extracts as an ingredient (that I've used). It is well worth over the price I paid for it ($2.99) at Marshall's. I definitely recommend buy it if you come across it somewhere.",

Second shave was pretty close, and better than the first, so it's looking up!\n\nCrazy to think how far I've come in this hobby since first beginning to wet shave a couple of years ago. Went from my humble EJ89 with a trusty puck of PDP 63, to now having probably a dozen soaps, multiple post shave products, custom brushes, and a razor that costed me more than 2 bills. This is truly a rabbit hole unlike any other I've encountred, but every time I practice this now sacred ritual, I'm reminded why I've invested my time and money.\n\nA once loathsome and tedious part of my daily routine has now become one of the few things I truly look forward to every day, irrespective of whatever shitstorm may be brewing in the \"real world.\" You can't really put a price on that. Sorry for getting all philisophical, just wanted to say I appreciate this hobby and all of you people in it who contribute to making it so enjoyable. Happy monday?",

Today will be day 4 trapped in the house with the kids. The wife had to cancel her business trip to California because we couldn't get her to the airport. And the airline actually paid her for cancelling. Current forecast says another 3-5 inches of snow today and then things will get interesting tomorrow with a possibility for a Slushpocalypse.\n\nGreat shave this morning with Seville in Reserve.\n\nIn other news, I decided to test out 3 Sheets yesterday and it got a solid *No* vote from the pretty little wife. I was informed that I would need to shower before I'd be allowed into bed. While I wasn't too thrilled with the scent myself, I think Chattilon Lux totally nailed the execution. For several hours, I smelled like a night's worth of iffy, alcohol-fueled, decisions. 10 points to Ravenclaw (I figure I've got a 1 in 3 shot of nailing u/hawns house on the first try since nobody cops to being Slytherin).",

I think that is the general quality that I get with Gillette Tech + Mild Blade combo. Not bad, not bad at all.\n\n**The Soap** was great. Hard soap but gives me a great lather all the time. It is not as slick as I would like but does the job. Also, the scent is very nice for a mass-produced(?) soap. Soapy, citrusy/floral scent.\n\n**The Razor and Blade** combination was good. One of the mildest combo that I have. Smooth but not as sharp as I would like it. Also, the Tech has a small sweetspot so I really have to pay attention to my angle. If I shave with it without paying attention, I would have masses of stubbles left. Challenging razor but it never gives me irritation.\n\n**The Brush** was the nicest part of the shave. Hearing from other Omega 10098 owners, it does take a while to break in the brush. However for me, it felt like it's already broken in. I only treated it with some shampoo/conditioner and soaked it/brushed it with towel for a day or two. When I was using it today, it felt so soft but had enough firmness to feel it. I do feel couple prickles because of the hard plastic-like bristles but overall, it is one of the best boar brushes that I have used.\n\n**The aftershave portion** was great. No sting. No irritation. A bit of stubble left on my neck but felt near perfect.\n\nOverall, a decent shave. I do want to change the blade and see how a Derby Extra feels with a Tech. I'll probably do that within this week. And what a surprise with the 10098! Soft from day two! I'll be using it religiously for weeks to come to break it in even more. Such a nice brush.",

WTG went very well, so I got over confident and tried an ATG/XTG pass. Won't be doing that again for awhile. Not the worst irritation I've had, but up there. I have to remember to crawl before I can hurdle. On the plus side, very close shave and Two Kings smells amazing.",

The old B&M Tre Citta vegan base performs really well. As far as scent goes, my nose picks it up as very mushroom forward. There are more scents in there, but I can't put my finger on any of them individually. It is blended well and no single scent overpowers the mix. I'm looking forward to using this soap again in a few days and seeing what else I can pick up in the scent. Happy Tuesday.\n\nedit: spelling and spacing (yeay mobile reddit)",

I have better soaps, but I have few soaps that are this good of a value. For ~$15 (sometimes much less) you get 5.25 ounces of hard milled soap that will last forever. It's lightly scented and lathers easily. Not a bad soap at all.\n\nToday should be...interesting.",

Starting to visibly dent noticeably.\n\nLast night I dreamed that I was being framed for multiple terrorist attacks. This was set in modern day, save for certain supernaturalities that we're considered the norm in society, mostly people with special gifts that became either heroes or villain typ people. I remember most distinctly I was in a suburban neighborhood when it first hit- explosions.\n\nI recall,a faraway noise as I approach a communal farmers market. It was not very crowded which was unusual. There was a tenseness. I saw ambulances. I saw bloodied bodies being carried on stretchers. My vision isn't that good without my glasses, and I go without my glasses often, so I didn't see much more than bloody blurred shapes. I found it distressing, but I didn't do much except approach to understand further. Then there were more explosions, people running out of the scene, some badly injured. I went home and told my housemates what I'd seen. I also told work I needed to not come to work for a while, since I had just been through a terrorist attack.\n\nThe second time happened when I visited an old forest in Ontario. I was with a companion, and we were talking about how I came to this forest to unwind when I was stressed. He and I were laying in some leaves and calm when I saw almost a donut looking thing, except a bit larger, and pale tan, be thrown from the corner of my eye in the distance. The resulting boom was loud, but we were more hit with the shockwave than injured by shrapnel. A second followed. I scrambled up, so did he, and we began to flee. Something hit my leg. Something hit his. We fled all the way to the car and then home.\n\nI moved after that, to an apartment deeper in town. For a few months it was calm and I was settled with my companion as a roommate. We were talking about my anxiety problems as a result of these events when a third occurred. It was summer then and we had the windows out. A donut looking thing flew into my room. Without hesitating I tossed it back out the window in a panic. More explosions from elsewhere in the building. I kept throwing back whatever went to my room. I knew I was possibly hitting pedestrians. I didn't give a fuck. I saw a black truck with someone inside, throwing rings. Panic. Panic. The truck drove off. It became quiet.\n\nI was arrested after that. I recall my upset about it. It happened a month after the last one in my apartment. Police came. My friends has been disturbed by my lack of visibly being torn up in my involvement with these incidents. I said to the police that I have a mental condition that caused me not to respond appropriately to situations. My friends claimed I was often violent in thought. I explained my mental condition caused me to think on morbid topics but I was harmless. Obviously the police didn't believe me. I was put in jail pending court.\n\nWhile I was in jail, it happened again. Not to me, but I'm a separate cave system near my jail. The villains were being pursued by a sort of hero person to their HQ. By the time the police found me, again, I had been broken out of jail and I was beating one of my accusers with a shovel I had found. Cutting into their legs like I was digging dirt. They had blown off a piece of my right hand. The hero found a baby, and decided he'd retire and spend the rest of his life raising this child.\n\nThe detectives apologized and I went back to living my life. The hero eventually had the child grow up and need to leave their peaceful isolation to another journey. I woke up shortly after that.\n\nEdit: I'm sorry it was long. The hero and child had more details but I decided to stop lol",

I really really like this scent. I won't go on to describe it in any real detail, but my nose mostly picks up a backbone of cherry and rum supporting a rather prominent white musk note. This just smells of class and sophistication and I dig it. My nose craves a stronger and longer lasting version of this so I'll probably end up with the EdP at some point as funds allow. Also took the Alumigoose for a rare spin and that thing is like easy mode. Not sure I could nick or irritate myself if I tried.\nHave a great Tuesday, gentlemen.",

Nice citrus opening, lovely geranium/vetiver drydown with faint hints of cedar and patchouli. Nice and earthy. Killer staying power too, for a soap... I can still smell it hours after my shave. It doesn't unseat my favorite Stirling scents from their thrones (it isn't my kind of fragrance) but it's nice stuff nevertheless.\n\n**The shave:** I was unimpressed by this blade in my Super Speed. Turns out I am also unimpressed with it in this razor. It definitely worked better with the DE89, but it was still painfully tuggy trying to clean up my chin and it took a lot of *work* to get a perfectly smooth shave, whereas the Wilkinson blades made it easy. You had your chance, Derby Extra... into the bin you go.",

I found a good deal on ebay, and got this one as well as its older brother: the Hayashi Diamond 8074 13/16 FH.\n\nThe 8074 honed up like a dream but for some reason I couldn't get a bevel set on this 40. So I threw it in my drawer and left it there.\n\nLast night I had some free time so I revisited the 40 and took it to the hones. But I stopped at 8k before I went to the strops. I haven't messed with this razor since it gave me so much trouble the last time, but for whatever reason - it honed right up. No issues.\n\nI used GTB, like I always do, as my test-shave soap. The Hayashi 40 is a solid shaver. I had a really nice, very smooth shave. This just reinforces 2 of the principles by which I live my life:\n\n1. Hiding your problems away and ignoring them for a year is an effective method. I mean: it didn't not work, right?!\n\n2. 8000 is fine. Depending on which religion of honing you subscribe to, and what temple (forum/Facebook group) you worship at: many would have you believe that a razor must be honed to somewhere between 20k and 30bajillion-K.\n\nNot true. I usually hone to 12k. But today's experiment showed that I can get a very good (not just passable) shave, from an 8k stone.\n\nHappy Tuesday all. And remember, why fix today what you can ignore until 2020? It'll be fine.",

Wostenholm & Sons Celebrated IXL 6/8 in koa and yellow G10\n\n\nReally fun shave today. I've been looking for the soap for months, and my friend was able to find it for me. Really nice warm and sweet scent, and great performance as usual. The splash was a nice complement, for me I get a very bright opening and a strong lingering cedar. Cedar fans need to have LLC in the den.\n\n\nThis brush belonged to a friend who had the knot fall out, and he asked me to help him with it. Per his request, I widened the hole to accommodate a larger knot, cleaned and polished it up, and set a silver fox synthetic I got from Logan at Lowborn Supply. As my first brush restoration, I asked him to keep me in mind if he ever decided to sell, and that time came. I'm glad to have it, not sure if I'll keep the synthetic knot but I love the color and shape.\n\n\nThe razor is a stunner, I had it out for an adventure with Ruds, where it had its moment to shine on YouTube. Really glad to have it back in the den.",

I had never heard of this artisan before until Rud's recent review of this soap. I was instantly sold on the Aventus scent and knew I wanted to try it out. The 0.5oz sample came in a small flat sealed pouch which is a departure from most artisan's small sample jars.\n\nThe soap is croap-like and has a mid scent strength once lathered. I'll need another shave or so to fully dial it in but it worked well with my hard water and still resulted in a slick and protective lather. Post shave feel was good and I paired it with A&E light Aventus scented post-shave serum.\n\nI really enjoyed the sample and will continue to use it until it's done.",

Excellent, top tier, all accolades deserved. The floral scent provided the aromatherapy I needed for an early morning today.\n\nThe Rob-claration B5 is the softest and my favorite knot right now.\n\nPulled out the Karve revisiting the C plate on a 3.5 in handle. Boy the C plate kicks the aggression up a notch coming from using the B for my daily shaves. Can't argue with the results. Quick to achieve BBS but but important to be carefully against the grain. Clean for me though, no issues.\n\nYRP Chatillon Lux - a perfect floral finish, the toner is great for the winter - very moisturizing, you only need a dab.\n",

I sleep on my ship (it isnt ideal, but as an officer, I have my own stateroom). So, I have a \"work den\" here and I rotate through a variety of soaps and AS.

For those who aren't aware, this is often regarded as the effective holy grail of Gem style razors. This was my first use with it, and I was impressed. First off, the weight is much more to my liking than most of my other vintage Gem style razors. Second, it was a wonderful balance of comfort and efficiency. And finally, it's a darn good looking razor. If I had the money to grab one, I would do it in a heartbeat. Looks like I'll probably be saving for one. They're not cheap. That being said, of course if anyone has one lying around that's not seeing any love, feel free to let me know ;)\n\n​\n\nOh, and Vintage is fricking incredible.",

I for one think they are among the best blades out there in quality. However, enough people seem to have problems with these to hinder me from recommending them to anyone. The only thing I can say is they have yet to let me down.\n\nThey are super sharp, and very smooth. They are carbon steel though so extra care must be taken to keep them dry as possible. I've speculated I'm the past that perhaps them being carbon steel affects how the edge feels, but that's just a theory. Whatever it is they are doing something right.",

Feather has been doing great for me in other razors lately. And this razor is one that usually treats me so well. But it was just a little off for me today. A little irritating. And I was disappointed with the low scent strength of the Barbershop soap.\n\nAnd I'm liking the Tuscany balm. A fun, sweet wild cherry (or seems like it) scent, with some bite and spices thrown in to keep it interesting.\n\n#### Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Fatip Testina Gentile ::: Feather ‹21 uses›)*\n\nI usually get such smooth service from this razor. But today was off. What ya gonna do? We'll try the feather in something else tomorrow. Or who knows... maybe repeat this one to see if I get the same results! Crazy science. But even with the comfort not being quite optimal, I got a nice, above-average shave in terms of closeness.\n\nNo tugging, but just a tiny bit of irritation.\n\n#### Soap Notes\n*^(Stirling - Barbershop)*\n\nWonderful performance, as usual from Stirling. I liked this lather, but next time I could back off of the water just a little and get more creaminess.\n\n30 second load with lightly-wet, scrubby boar brush + 2.5 tsp water = 4-5 passes of nicely slick lather.\n\nScent: I like the scent coming from the dry puck, and the lighter version coming from the lather bowl, when I stuck my nose down in it. A fairly traditional barbershop.\n\nScent Strength: 2-3/10, barely present during shaving, unfortunately.\n\nBowl - I used the XL version of this bowl:\nhttps://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3392930\n\n\n#### Brush Notes\n*^(Stirling - Boar 24mm Factory Seconds)*\n\nAs usual, a bit scrubby. Hopefully it softens up with more use. It's still young. Holds a ton of lather, though. Soaked it for a couple hours before use.\n\n#### Shave Quality\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Cut flush to where I just see the tips (above average for me)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm)\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

I was running low on time last night and my neck has been in pretty rough shape so I decided to use the cartridge razor instead of the DE. Although I saved a few minutes I probably should've just used the DE anyway. This razor didn't really seem to save me much irritation, but considering it's the middle of winter it could just be my skin being constantly irritated from the cold. I need to start using some moisturizer or something. Maybe some balms?",

(says so on the bottle) Gave it a shot. Honestly, no noticeable difference, other than the fact that I don't typically use menthol soaps, and it gave the History 101 a bit of a menthol hit, so there's that. YMMV, of course. Since I could't let Big Aftershave win, I didn't go back to the La Terre Verte, and used Gratiot League Square instead for aftershave. I showed them!\n\nI will say, the La Terre Verte/History 101/Gratiot League Square cocktail that was on my face was a nice combo.",

Pretty average in my experience. The soap on the other hand was great. Chilly menthol with ice cold water.\n\n**The Soap** was great. The menthol kicked in and with the ice cold water, it felt nice and chilly. The slickness was there. The creaminess was there. The protection was there. I did have to dial in a bit more water after the first lather but overall, a great soap for me.\n\n**The Razor and Blade** combination wasn't too bad but I still felt a tug on some areas and it wasn't the smoothest. I would say Derby Extra doesn't do a good job in general for me. I'm going to see if it works with extra shaves but highly doubt it.\n\n**The Brush** was solid. For a synthetic, it was a bit prickly but nothing to complain about. The best thing about this brush is the looks. It looks amazing and I love seeing it in my den. It works well enough and gave me a good lather.\n\n**The aftershave portion** was cool. Literally. The menthol soap + Balm combo feels really nice on my face. Although the Nivea cooling balm has minimal menthol, it gives that extra light touch that I enjoy.\n\nOverall, a decent shave. I'll try one more use with the Derby Extra. Also, I do enjoy menthol shaves very much so I'll be looking for more menthol products in the future (i.e. Stirling mostly)",

Excellent cutting , with good comfort. Experimented to see if, by scooping out my soap instead of lathering on the surface, I could dig down to part of the soap with more scent, and maybe have the scent be more available during the shave. Didn't work that I could tell.\n\n#### Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Gillette - Flat-bottom Tech - UK Thin Bar Handle ::: Feather ‹22 uses›)*\n\nThis is a nice little piece of history. It worked the Feather well, and while it wasn't as smooth as my pre-war tech, it gave an above average result in just 3 passes.\n\nNo tugging or irritation.\n\n#### Soap Notes\n*^(Stirling - Barbershop)*\n\nWonderful performance, as usual from Stirling.\n\n1/4+ tsp measured and whipped up with lightly-wet, boar brush + 3.5 tsp water = 5 passes of nicely slick lather. Just enough to give me some margin to screw up, just in case.\n\nScent: I like the scent coming from the dry puck, and the lighter version coming from the lather bowl, when I stuck my nose down in it. A fairly traditional barbershop.\n\nScent Strength: 3/10, barely present during shaving, unfortunately.\n\nBowl - I used the XL version of this bowl:\nhttps://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3392930\n\n\n#### Brush Notes\n*^(Semogue - 1305 Boar)*\n\nThis brush, after just 6 uses, just feels so good. No brush burn from this one. Great, soft tips. Yes, I'm soaking it before each shave, while young, No prickle at all.\n\n#### Shave Quality\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Cut flush to where I just see the tips (above average for me)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm)\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

Cloudy, then gradually becoming mostly sunny, with a high near 39. Northeast wind 10 to 15 mph becoming west in the afternoon. New precipitation amounts between a tenth and quarter of an inch possible. High tide at 5:15 this evening.\n\nBrush Lathers: 19\nStill had to go back to the cream after the first pass. This makes me think that I am not loading nearly enough so it's user error.\n\nUp at 2:30 this morning to snow blow so the wife could get to work. When I started it wasn't really doing anything, but after about 5 minutes it started raining. That was awesome because it usually takes me about 2 hours to get all the snow blowing done. By the time I got inside all my gear felt like it was 20 pounds heavier. My gloves were just puddles of water around my finger tips. After all of that I wanted an aftershave that reminded me of warmer weather.\n\nOver all it was another nice shave, but I have to start loading this cream a bit heavier that I would with the Cade Riche.\n\nHope everyone has a nice Wednesday!",

Reminds me a lot of Wyoming; they have high winds and have wind barriers along the highways. It's rather cool and scary to see the snow whip around the barriers as you're going down the highway. My wife grew up for a few years in a small town called Victor, Idaho, which in Idaho terms is just around the corner from Jackson Hole, Wyoming. Upon first receiving MF Roam I was hesitant that she would strongly disapprove, but instead she LOVED it. To her it literally reminded her of her childhood going to Jackson and smelled like the old farmhouses and cabins she would play in. Hence today's inspiration to use MF Roam. This soap is one of my all-time favorites, but doesn't get used all that often cos it's gotta be the right kinda day, and in today's case, a windy day off. Happy hump day folks!",

Like, some people get a meat smell while others get the \"correct\" smell of leather/coffee? Well, I never got the meat perspective until I used the EDT. Not just that, but only when I use it as the trifecta, I get a strong meat smell with musk. If I use only the EDT, it smells like good ol' Leviathan. It's strange, maybe I'll only use the EDT on shaving off-days.\n\nLife is short, shave with good gear.\n\nEdit: removed secret sotd",

It usually ends up really dry and pasty, and then boom it's almost instantly too light and airy. It's a tough soap for me to get right, but it does seem to have good residual slickness for me.\n\nMake em say uhhhhhhh....can I get uhhhhhh?\n\n​",

The scent was a bit weak, but I assume this was due to the small sample size.\n\n\n\nAll in all a very enjoyable shave - the B&R adjustable on 2.5 during the first pass removed five days worth of growth as if non existent.\n\n\n\n**I hope you all have a wonderful Wednesday**",

It is a very well done rose scent. The soap I get mostly rose (and I'm sure some supporting elements that I can't pick out). The splash is where the magic happens, I absolutely love it. I get the rose and all kinds of other stuff I don't recognize, and a burst of citrus. I don't get much of the oud which is good for me personally as I don't really care for it at all, but part of me wishes for more of it to fit the theme and see the rose and oud battle it out. Anyone who likes rose should be this.",

I like that it is mild and just is nice to my skin.\n\nI am not that impressed with Oleo shave soap. I have trouble dialing it in consistently and find the slickness to be \"meh\". It does not burn my skin at all so that is a plus. I have used other unscented soaps (henri et victoria, caties bubbles) and those gave my skin a slight burning feel but Oleo is ok. I just don't think the performance is there to buy again. In any case I will use the tub up and move on to other things. Also, while speick a/s has good skin feel I find the scent to overstay its welcome. I can smell it throughout the day. Its not a strong scent but maybe I have reached a point that I am bored with it.",

I wish there was a parfum strength version of this scent out there somewhere.\n\nWe've gotten fancy in this hobby, but the good old stuff that got us started shouldn't be forgotten, especially if the performance is solid!\nThe Rockwell was the first \"expensive\" razor I bought and I haven't looked back. For some reason this razor and blade combo felt quite tame/inefficient today. Not sure why, there's a lot of variables. Perhaps it's because I've been using more mid to aggressive razors/plates lately. Maybe it's because I honestly didn't have too much growth today.\n\nThe brush and splash were awesome.\n\nHump day! can't wait for this week to end.",

However, I did get some irritation/razor burn as a result. Mild blade is not meant for BBS, at least for me. Learned that lesson today.\n\n**The Soap** was great. The first lather was a bit tough as William's needs a lot of water and lathering in the soap. I got lazy and shaved with a half-dissipating lather. It worked well enough. The second lather was a lot better. I mixed in more water until it got to that creamy state. Really slick soap but hard to make a creamy lather, at least with a face lathering technique.\n\n**The Razor and Blade** combination was suprisingly nice. It didn't feel sharp but I felt comfortable during the shave. Now the post-shave was different. When I used the Alum block, I immediately felt the burn around my chin and neck. I did try to get a BBS and that was a mistake. Even after putting on my go-to balm, I still felt the burn.\n\n**The Brush** was solid. It's slowly getting softer but I love the big plushy feel of the brush. Definitely a lather hog/water hog but that's something that I just have to be mindful of. Loaded a ton and had to add water a ton.\n\n**The aftershave portion** was rough. The Alum stung a lot and the balm tried to do its job but still had some irritation from the shave. Nothing wrong with the aftershave set-up; just a irritated skin from the shave.\n\nOverall, an okay shave. My stubbles are mostly gone but irritation took place instead. From now, I won't be chasing a BBS with mild blades. Derby Extra is an average blade that I will probably use for a comfortable shave. Again, no BBS with Derby, note to myself.",

I pay ZERO attention and get a great, smooth shave. If I want BBS I need to pay a little closer attention on my angle, but not for the reason of avoiding nicks or weepers. I've blade buffed on my neck with their razor with no ill effects. I can barely go ATG on my neck (where my problem areas are).\n\nThis T&H cream is excellent. I'm not really a cream guy...they seem to have less water-taking capabilities, so I tend to underload. This one got me three passes with a little to spare, but not much. Top notch slickness, residual, and post shave face feel. Great straight up lime scent to boot, good shit!!!\n\nDFS shave today. It's overcast, and lime scent wouldn't be my normal go to for this weather, but I told /u/middleeasternviking I would get back to him regarding longevity of scent with this balm.\n\nSomething to note, check out 'Alexandria - Boschetti Della Costa', its a very nice lime forward fragrance from a California based perfumer.",

My second go at the straight went much better. I used the lightest touch I could while keeping the blade on the skin. Ended up doing a three pass WTG/XTG/XTG with DFS results. I know I will still have some rough shaves ahead, but it gives me a hint of things to come. Noble Otter remains in the top of my rotation with arguably my favorite scents. After picking up Two Kings with the matching splash, I may have to start grabbing the rest of their aftershaves as well.

Good cutting in just 3 passes. Comfy AND close.\n\nNo tugging or irritation.\n\n#### Soap Notes\n*^(Black Ship Grooming - Cap'n Dark Side)*\n\nThis soap impressed me. Wonderful lather that was slick, so slick. Razor was moving around really well. Nice and protective and cushiony too.\n\n30 second load with lightly-wet brush + 3.5 tsp water = 5-6 passes of lather.\n\nMaybe load for 20 next time.\n\nScent: Leather scent with blackberry and ozone, softened by amber. I like it.\n\nScent Strength: 4-5/10, nicely present during shaving.\n\nBowl - I used the XL version of this bowl:\nhttps://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3392930\n\n\n#### Brush Notes\n*^(Zenith - B10 Boar Red)*\n\nI continue to enjoy this brush, even this young.\n\n#### Shave Quality\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Few hairs are showing some tip length (with most being cut flush)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm)\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

It burns while I shave and then the aftershave burns for about 20 minutes after I put it on. Because of that I wanted a brush that wasn't very harsh on the face. Other than the normal burning that I get it was a nice shave. I tend to only use this soap 3, maybe 4 times a year.\n\nHave a nice Thursday everyone!",

Very \"holiday baking spice\"-y. I like it and I'll be keeping a puck of this stuff around for next winter because it smells appropriately seasonal without going all \"look at me hur dur it's xmas\" and beating the shit out of you with a pine bough. My wife isn't a fan of this soap, but our anniversary is Saturday and we don't celebrate on the 14th so I can get away with a soap she hates today.\n\n**The shave:** This is my first time shaving with an Astra blade of any kind. I give it a thumbs up. I had a conversation on Tuesday about shaving with gear that makes it easy to get good results with minimal irritation rather than gear that makes it difficult (because why would I do that?). Astra seems to fall into the \"easy\" category. If it were a tad sharper it might have handled my problem patch better, but other than that? Zero complaints. Extremely close BBS shave all over in two passes with a teensy bit of clean-up, and there wasn't even much stubble left for the second pass to catch.\n",

The soap, toner, and edt are all so different smelling. The soap I get a bunch of chocolate and floral pollen, the toner I got a blast of the damp earth which I didn't smell in either other version, and the edt I sprayed before fully appreciating the toner but I got welcomed by an opening blast of chocolate and less than an hour later it's something floral and, I don't have the word for it, maybe it's the ambergris? Anyway, glad I picked it up, hopefully the wife likes it as I mostly bought it for her since it's a VDay release. Y'all treat your SOs right today (and every other day) and make em feel special. To you single ladies and gentlemen, enjoy yourselves and don't feel any self pity as there's nothing wrong or inferior about being single.",

My wife really enjoys my face smelling like a new briefcase. Who am I to judge? I would never be able to shave with this AND put the toner on though. When I came downstairs she actually started dancing and singing, \"Cuero de cuero!\" A hilarious start to the day. Good thing I don't have a mistress 'cause I'm pretty sure my wife is the only lady who would want me smelling like this. Such a strong dark leather.",

I've always had trouble with the Declaration bison base, and I've mostly used synth brushes with it, not this time. The badger brush and dry loading method actually worked a champ on this go-round. The best I've ever dialed it in.\n\nAnd with that comes an excellent shave! Although I've realized that that Karve C is is a touch more aggressive than I'd like for daily shaving. This doesn't mean others, even beginners would think so YMMV. The B plate seems to be my sweet spot.\n\n\n\n",

This community is too generous and too awesome for people like myself.\n\nAt first I wasn't sure what I was doing wrong with the straight, it being my first, and tried different preshave techniques, but my shaves sucked and couldn't even do a pass. I tried stropping differently and even doing more laps on the canvas before moving to leather. Still didn't work. So I sent the razor to get honed and it came back perfect!\n\nSo today was the day and what better day than Beaudelaire release day! And I guess Valentines Day too. So wet this beautiful brush and began loading a nice dense lather and went to town. I've used shavettes before so I had the hang of holding the scales and razor and shaving with a really sharp blade. This was so much easier and smoother than any shavette I've used and finished the first pass much faster than I do with my DE. My dexterity with a straight/shavette still isn't that great, so I was only shaving my cheeks and neck and avoiding the jaw and mustache area. I finished those harder areas with my Black Beauty, but I could easily tell that straight shaved much closer as I wasn't getting my usual chatter from the DE.\n\nAwesome shave!\n\nThanks guys!",

It's cold and rainy here this morning and I was in a mood for something like this...kind of a warm, slightly musky scent. This is a rare vegan base that I think performs just as well as tallow soaps. The splash formula has grown on me as well: only a slight tingle from the witch hazel and leaves my skin very soft and moisturized. Those who shy away from alcohol-based splashes should give this one a try--it's a nice middle ground between that and a balm.",

I bought this ~~yuck~~ tuck time ago, and just never used it. A buddy of mine asked me to check fitment of this blade on this razor, so I opened up the tuck and threw it in. Fit fine, maybe a little snug. So rather than waste the blade, I just left it in and used it this morning. Not bad! It felt like a Wizamet after the hump at about 6 shaves, which is smooth. I doubt I'll be doing any switches from Wizamet, but I'm going to ride out this blade. At very worst, it could be a good travel blade, no wax to clean off!!!\n\nWhat better day than today to go with Beaudelaire. Not only does it match today's theme, it's also Re-Re-Release day at West Coast Shaving, which will also include a EDT of this fantastic scent. I feel like a commercial, but I absolutely LOVE this scent. I even have a stash of Black Label still. I've been using this Glissant, but I'll get back to Black Label as I prefer it much more than Glissant.\n\nLove it or hate it, I don't care. I'm gon' keep on keepin' on using this goodness.\n\nDFS shave for me today with some of my favorite gear, one of my if not favorite scents, and a new to me blade. Hell yeah!!!!!\n\nIt's raining more here again. It's been insane just how much we have had this year. I honestly cannot remember ever having this much rain in a year. Ever. Anyhow, I like the sound, and we need it, I just hope people drive safely and no ones homes fall off the hillsides or cliffs.\n\nHappy Valentines Day you freaks!\n=)",

      "body": "*In which MDY expands his musical horizons. (Part II)*\n\n**Bath Bar:** Stirling Soap Co. - Mountain Man\n\n**Prep:** Hot coffee. Hot shower. Gojira.\n\n**Brush:** Yaqi 26mm synthetic\n\n**Razor:** Merkur 37c\n\n**Blade:** Polsilver (3)\n\n**Lather:** Stirling Soap Co. - Mountain Man\n\n**Aftershave:** Old Spice\n\n**Frag:** Stirling Soap Co. - EMP\n\n**Song:** [Gojira - The Cell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J13GI4Xik1o)\n\nShort intro on the band without sounding too much like Wikipedia: They are a 4-piece group hailing from Bayonne, France. Formed in 1996 under the name Godzilla, later changed to Gojira in 2001. Built by brothers Joe (lead vocals) and Mario Duplantier (drums), the band has enjoyed recent success including Grammy nominations after laboring in relative obscurity regarding their first five albums. The album I listened to for this SOTD is their latest offering, released 06.17.16, under Roadrunner Records, titled *Magma.* 10 tracks. 43 minutes. 2 instrumentals. Featured genres according to Wikipedia are **progressive metal** and **groove metal.** Highlights to follow, for *moi.* (*Moi* is French for 'me.' Y'all in the back can write that down.)\n\n* [The Shooting Star](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnRv4azfris)\n\nGreat opening to the album and the music video isn't bad either. They definitely have my interest after this track. The drummer tossed in a couple half-bar double-time licks that made me grin. A Phil Rudd he is not.\n\n* [Silvera](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVvXB-Vwnco)\n\nWow. Alright. I had to listen to this one a few times, if not just to get past the music video. I'm realizing that part of the challenge with these \"reviews\" is going to be separating the music video from the music but holy hell, this music video is great. There is some upsetting imagery, although nothing I would call NSFW, per se. I'm pretty sure it's New York and the band is playing on this rooftop. At about 1:50, the bridge happens and the tone changes and some of the shots of them playing their instruments are borderline action sequences, with them jumping and running around with their guitars and looking generally pissed off. I got chillz. This song was nominated for Best Metal Performance at the 2017 Grammy's and I can see why. There is nothing boring here. I already know these guys are a blast to see live. Tons of energy.\n\n* [The Cell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J13GI4Xik1o)\n\nThis was my favorite track on the album. Epilepsy warning on the music video. I would argue that this track is somewhat of a drum feature and I don't think I'm being biased here. I think Mario is showcasing his speed and precision, especially in the intro with the breakneck sixteenth notes and the closing bars, where he finally gets some time to stretch out and do some fills. This track does not quit. The music video is interesting, most of the footage is from live shows and I do not have the vocabulary to express the technique but it's like negatives, where darks are light and vice versa. Some of you photography buffs probably know what it's called. At about 0:40, a single black tear falls from Joe's pupil-less left eye.\n\n* [Stranded](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNdC_3LR2AI)\n\nThis is a pretty upsetting music video and props to that actress. She's kind of got an Emily Rose thing going on, that scene in the movie where she wakes up on the floor, all double-joints and twisted up. That movie fucked me up for awhile. Possession gives me the heebie-jeebies. And but so this song is brutal and in your face. At risk of sounding like a broken record, the drums are great on this track and the squealing guitars work really well. This was the track that /u/shredsofmetal initially linked me to and I think he knew what he was doing. A line from Dom Lawson's review in *The Guardian:* \"Magma is the kind of album that metalheads would love non-believers to check out, if only because it confounds all the usual stereotypes about the genre being unimaginative and dumb.\" The best part of this track is the refrain at the end. The angry yelling stops and you get this kind of desolate, soft, sad plea, over and over, to *\"Leave the moment alone.\"* Great ending.\n\n* [Yellow Stone (Instrumental, no music video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ToHja9uVkDE)\n\nAfter the first four tracks, I was really jonesing for this instrumental. At only 80 seconds long, it sort of plods along and is the slowest track, tempo-wise, so far. Maybe they meant this as a transition to the rest of album? I don't know but it was underwhelming. It reminded me of Black Sabbath's [Iron Man.]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aQRq9hhekA)\n\n* [Magma (audio only)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLC9CHxNHHU)\n\nThere is an audio effect over the vocals that I don't really like. It's not autotune but it just sounds flat. At 6:43, this is the longest track on the album. It coulda been shorter, the bridge in the middle just kept going and going. This was one of the weaker tracks for me.\n\n* [Pray (audio only)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLwKCdxN9vk)\n\nOther than the instrumentals, nothing here stands out too much. There are 6 unique lyric lines in this song. Six. Just too repetitive for me. I loved the beat though.\n\n* [Only Pain (audio only)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqLI8smRob0)\n\nA little too similar to \"Stranded,\" from the cadence of the vocals down to the squealing guitar riff in the beginning. These could almost be mirror tracks. But \"Stranded\" is better.\n\n* [Low Lands]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j03lu6SBR8)\n\nThis track and video provide the context for this whole album and they explain a lot of the lyrics and imagery in the videos. While in the middle of recording this album in New York, Joe and Mario's mother died. This track is a tribute to her, in a sense, as is the music video, which was recorded by their cousin, Alain. See the look in Joe's eyes as he fades into the screen. It's clear, and the lyrics only reinforce it. (There are also a couple lines of French, which was cool.) Indeed, it was eventually revealed that the brothers were \"often fighting back tears during the sessions.\" The acoustic outro for the track is well-placed and appropriate and sad.\n\n* [Liberation (Instrumental, no music video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWhiTZz2aP0)\n\nAcoustic guitar and a set of bongos and that's it. A nice, soft outro for an intense record.\n\n**Final Thoughts:** What an interesting album. On the whole, I definitely liked it better than the Unleash The Archers review I did last week. These lyrics have a lot more substance and on a personal note, are relatively relatable. Sometimes. The first half was better than the last half, with the split coming after the first instrumental. I'm usually listening to the drummer, as that's my *forte,* and I was impressed throughout with what he can do. I was not surprised to learn that he won an award for Best Drummer at the 2017 Loudwire Music Awards. I'm not familiar with Loudwire but recognition is recognition. This is an album I would roll around and listen to if I were feeling in an aggressive mood. And I will definitely be going back and listening to some of their older stuff.\n_________\n\n*(I'm still figuring out how to format these reviews and, well, how to review and present said reviews in an engaging and informative manner. I'm finding that, similar to describing scents, I feel inadequate. As in, I know how a song makes me feel but that I don't know how to accurately describe it. I feel frustrated because I tend to use the same words and phrases several times. This is something I'm working on. Any words of advice or what I can do differently are absolutely welcome.)*\n_______\n\n**Regarding the shave:** Got me a Mountain Man sample and bath bar, solely because of the green tea note. I'm gonna try to use up this sample as I use up the bath bar. For the next 7-10 shaves or so, I'ma be a Mountain Man! Without the flannel, though. And I will not be shaving with a bowie knife. But I might go outside and look at some trees by the smelly, polluted highway.\n\nHappy Friday! We made it!\n\n\n\n\n",

A few weepers and a little irritation, but overall not bad. I've been watching some YouTube videos to get some ideas of angles and grip. I think I have enough shave stuff for now, going to try and lock down the buying until I actually need something, but we'll see how that goes. Need to come to grips with the FOMO(fear of missing out) when it comes to new products.",

Elliot 6/8 wedge\n**Post:** Thayers lavender - Oil of Olay Complete\n**Extra Post:** Chatillon Lux skin salve\n\nI set this soap out some time back and always decided to use a different soap. I finally used it today. I haven't used it since probably June. DRH is one of the few remaining old school English brands still worth using. And Arlington is my favorite DRH scent.\n\nI think this brush is thouroughly broken in. It has an excellent face feel. I hate the dye job on this brush though. And the 620 as well. I like boar knots to look like a boar knot. But I can look past that superficial trait as long as it is a good brush. This one is.\n\nYeah...Friday.",

The coffee scent is really great in the morning, and the sandalwood and leather really gives it a wonderful sweetness. One of the best.\n\nI'm really digging Apple Music. Can just listen to whatever I want. Decided in the shower I was in the mood for mellow singer-songwriter, and bam, I'm able to pull up CSN. Such a great album.

I did get some lily after first applying but after that fades, it turns into this soft, almost woody scent. Not as sharp as the dark chocolates I've smelled and definitely not like wet earth nor bitter like cocoa powder. More sniffing is required.\n\nI'm lost on Biblio's notes. I can say that it reminds me of old books, not musty ones that have been stored away, but reminiscent of one of those hardbacks that have the uneven pages and has changed color over time. There is a seeeter note that sits on top that I cannot identify yet.",

Still very adequate for a nice shave, but a stark contrast in lather structure and slickness from the new base. Like the other APRs I've tried, the soap is kind of just ok, giving you but a preview of what the scent's going to offer. Upon applying the splash, the Mousse de Saxe really reveals itself and I start really enjoying it. Unfortunately I didn't have the most time to appreciate it this morning or have the EdP to match, so I just sort of enjoyed the first few whiffs, spritzed some Grey Flannel and headed out the door. Been a minute since I smelled GF, and so long that I convinced myself that I didn't like it anymore. But I do like it, I like it quite a bit. So glad it's Friday!",

Big thanks again to /u/devilsmaycry1974 for hooking me up. It's probably my favorite coffee scent I can remember, creamy and nutty, rich but not overpowering. I don't have a coffee splash but my next Mammoth scent was a perfect complement.\n\n\nThe brush is a special one. Recently I made a number of brush blanks out of mahogany and ipe for a brushmaking competition. I sent one to TDR in a trade to make this brush. It's a barber style, the ipe stripe pops, and I love this knot!\n\n\nI've lost count of how many shaves I have in on this Wizamet blade. I'll keep using it til I feel any tugging, but it's pretty amazing to see a blade keep going and going.",

I'm not well versed in Oud as a note, but from what I know of it, I smell barely any (none?) in this fragrance thus far. And that's okay. The primary notes to my nose are cedar and pepper. It's a natural cedar and blends nicely with the other notes - some sandalwood, and other *green* notes that I'm not quite great at identifying. I could see this becoming the fall/winter work scent with Green Irish Tweed serving the spring and summer.\n\nHappy Friday, all.",

Still deliberating on whether I can make this razor work for me, and the with the Karve open combs on their way to market soon, things are gonna have to get more comfortable sooner rather than later before I abandon hope.\n\nHad a Valentine's Day I will remember fondly for a change, and although I think it's a commercial fraud of a holiday, spending the day with someone special is enough for me to put aside my grievances. After all, the holiday isn't really about me, so I guess that puts it into the proper perspective.\n\nHappy start of the weekend!",

Testing out this OC Timeless to see if the geometry will work with this old blade. (It did some, but Sheraton is better). Also trying Jeeves for the first time.\n\n#### Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Timeless .68 - Open Comb ::: Gillette - Nacet ‹121 uses›)*\n\nI'm trying my open comb Timeless on the old Nacet because it's been on the aggressive side for me with younger blades. It did turn out to be a decent match for the smoothed-out Nacet. However, the Sheraton is more comfortable.\n\nTiny bit of tugging, and a little irritation due to the OC razor.\n\n#### Soap Notes\n*^(Jeeves of Hudson St - Barbershop)*\n\nA very good base. Though I didn't like this scent, and it was too weak, I may seek out another scent from this maker.\n\n40 second load with lightly-wet brush + who-knows tsp water = 5 passes of slick lather that was on the wet end of the acceptable spectrum.\n\nScent: all I picked up when dry as well as on my face was Amber. When I stuck my nose in the lather bowl, I did pick up something more complex, but that's the only time I detected it. Probably too light to keep.\n\nScent Strength: 3/10, not really present during shaving.\n\nBowl - I used the XL version of this bowl:\nhttps://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3392930\n\n\n#### Brush Notes\n*^(Semogue - 1800 Boar)*\n\nA soft brush was nice today, since the aggression of this razor tenderized my skin a little. This has lots of splay and medium-light backbone. I like it. Very comfy.\n\n#### Shave Quality\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: A little irritating\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Few hairs are showing some tip length (with most being cut flush)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm)\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

Then I had to come home to ensure the 7-year old made it to school (which is on a 2-hour delay due to lingering snow and ice). Now I'm all alone in the house (and online doing work stuff) until the little one gets out at 3:50. Then it's an extended daddy-daughter weekend until the teenbeast returns on Tuesday. I predict we will be playing a lot of Minecraft since that's currently her favorite thing in the whole world.\n\nGreat shave this morning with the Shore and Karve razor. I decided to go with the CL balm as the air is still cold, dry, and not very skin friendly.\n\nIn other news, I've undertaken my first real coding project in Python. Still getting used to this language, but there are a metric fuckton of useful libraries, which I appreciate.",

Though not ultrasharp, the Bolzie is certainly sharper than Astra, plus with excellent QC and a longer lifespan. Plus, unlike Astra, a really smooth and pleasant shave for the life of the blade. And no globs of wax! Costs more, but bulk subscription orders from Amazon bring the cost down to about $0.17 per blade, which given the roughly 50% longer blade life (IME) makes them about the same cost per shave as Astra SPs.\n* Post: An amazingly effective product, awesome value, available in virtually every CVS in America...Smell is nice enough also, assuming you like AV.",

It builds a rich and protective lather. It's very confortable to grab and to use. The knot feels soft but also has great backbone. I tried to get that beautiful blue pop in the photo but still doesn't look as good as when you see it in person.\n\nRegarding the shave in general, it was phenomenal. GTB soap and splash combination is one of my favourites if not my favourite so far. It makes me feel like I can achieve anything in this world.",

Admittedly, I've had limited experience with boozy, tobacco soaps and aftershaves, so I don't know if there is better, but I sure love this. The Maggard is very pipe tobacco forward. If you have smelled Cavendish then you know what I'm referring to. Think vanilla, strawberries, cherry, rum, whisky, and liquorice. The leather comes after and it's more of a base note. This is not a terribly complex scent, but smells excellent and then lathers easily. Slickness is perhaps a 7/10 vs. Icarus as a 10/10.\n\nAftershave is solid, with heavy vanilla and whiskey influence. There's a bit of leather that pairs well with the soap and some Sandalwood too. All in all, very happy with this shave.\n\nCheers!",

They're leaving me home alone, trusting that I'll be a good boy. They/we've been listening to jazz and electronic house lately, as well as the Hamilton soundtrack (daughters are completely obsessed with it). Beggars Banquet was the first vinyl my dad ever owned. When he passed my mom got rid of all his music stuff.\n\nTL;DR: I'm starting off my Macauly Culkin week with Sympathy for the Devil sync'ed up in all the speakers of the house. It's loud, very loud. And Talbot River Rouge pairs nicely with all this.\n\nHappy Saturday to everyone.",

I enjoy them both very much especially once I found the right settings and it is very hard for me to decide for one or the other...\n\n\n\nMaybe at the more aggressive setting (3 on the Rex, 2.5 on the B&R - first pass) the Rex is slightly smoother, but on the milder settings (2 on the Rex, 1 on the B&R - subsequent passes) the B&R has the advantage - in any case the end result is pretty similar and my face feels equally happy.\n\n\n\nAlso very pleased to get a second shave out of the Declaration soap sample generously donated by the 2019 Paste & Cut Meet-Up Sample box. [The lather was again wonderful](https://i.imgur.com/L9wjjGy.jpg) and overall it was a perfect Saturday shave.\n\n\n\n**I hope you all have a fantastic weekend**",

I mean, all the stuff I used is good stuff, but the enjoyment and satisfaction were way up there.\n\nLet's start with the soap. With the recent talk about old times around here, I wanted to use a soap from an OG. And this tub is OG itself. It's one of the original big ass 8oz tubs that will last three lifetimes. No shit y'all. The CB tubs all used to be packed with 8oz of soap. This thing is heavy enough to be a murder weapon. And the soap is pretty good too.\n\nThere have been a number of peeps showing interest in boars lately and this is my favorite and as such I recommend it a lot. Some people would not like the size since the trend is to use brushes big enough to paint a barn with, but I like the size and I don't mind if I have to reload a little for the last pass.\n\nThe biggest surprise to me so far this year has been the CL skin salve. I sampled the old formula a few years ago and it was okay, but it didn't work for me as well as the new formula. I like it so much that I use it twice a day. It kinda reminds me of those Franks Hot Sauce spots...\"I put that $%@& on everything\".\n\nOff to do the weekend.",

I'm finding this Astra/Super Speed combo so smooth and effortless shaving with the grain that I can hardly even feel if the blade is engaging the whiskers as I shave... Across and against the grain I can feel it cutting, but it's still pretty comfortable (even in problem areas) as long as I keep my touch nice and light. I would guess that it isn't quite as sharp as a German Wilkinson Sword (which has torn my face up a few times when I got careless) but it's certainly a sharper & smoother shaver than Derby Extra. Big thumbs up for Astra: I'll definitely consider this razor/blade combination a mainstay in my collection in the future.",

This is what I need to do with Derby blades. I cannot go over an area multiple times but it will reduce the stubble to an acceptable level for me. And a shocker for the shave cream... I'll go more in detail.\n\n**The Soap** was a bit shocking for me. Not that it didn't work but the fact that it disappeared on me 100%. I put a bit more than usual on the bowl and lathered it. Then I face lathered and started off a bit thin. But 20 seconds later, there was no lather at all. Not even foamy lather but none. Then I realized, 'This is a brushless cream.' I tried putting more cream into the brush just in case but nope, it did not help. I lathered onto my face with my fingers and it felt wrong... but I shaved with it and didn't give me any irritation. The cream is really slick and a bit protective but it still has that thin layer that I do not like to see. The scent is a bit herbal and medicinal but still has a clean smell to it. Overall, a disappointing cream but it still worked.\n\n**The Razor and Blade** combination did its work. A little rough on some places but it is a Derby blade. As long as I did not put more pressure and go over an area multiple times, the shave was fine. I'm going to push this blade and see how many times I can shave with it before it really becomes dull. So far, it's been good.\n\n**The Brush** was used for 20 seconds. Then, I left it on its side and just felt it wanting me to use it. I was tempted to pull out another soap but I let it go and continued to use it with my hands. Betrayal at its finest.\n\n**The aftershave portion** was nice. No sting and no irritation. I can still feel some stubbles on my neck but it looks fine on the mirror. No BBS but no irritation. I'll take it.\n\nOverall, a decent shave. The cream was brushless so I used my fingers. I would much rather use a brush to create a voluptuous lather but sometimes it doesn't call for it. I might use this cream later on when I need to go in a quick second. And the blade will continue its test through the Derby plains. lol",

The Phoenix and Beau lathered easily after loading for 100 swirls. It was thick and slick and somewhere above Reserve and below WK and DG for me. It was my first go with this base. While present it was very slick but it dries after a pass and needed some water to \"wake-up\" if I wanted to buff something. I nicked myself once during an ATG pass on my upper neck/ jaw but frankly that's sport shaving for me and I just wanted to see what would happen. The Lamplight Penance Toner was the only post shave today because I wanted to get a full sense of it. I've read it's complex and evolves as well as being polarizing. It's quite strong and I continue to believe Shawn's stuff offers a tremendous value in terms of projection and lasting power. It reminds me of scented kerosene oil somewhat and after 30 minutes I got my first hint of blackberry and while I'm writing this a vanilla note popped outta nowhere. The wife rates this a 7/10 on me with Stirling's Kaboom a 10 for her. She likes it as much as GLS. The more I use and wear some of this artisan stuff the more I appreciate what this medium offers me. I only ever considered fragrance makers as corporations working to create and market money makers. I never imagined someone might try to sketch a portrait of someone, or a place or an experience from smells. Needless to say I'm getting a lot out of this rabbit hole I jumped into.",

More comfortable than the Timeless 68 OC yesterday.\n\n#### Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Karve - Christopher Bradley F Plate ::: Gillette - Nacet ‹122 uses›)*\n\nKarve's most aggressive plate for the Chris Bradley worked fairly well for this old blade. I'm pretty sure this head would be way too harsh for me with a young blade, but I'm going to try it.. for science... some day.\n\nTiny bit of tugging, but easily manageable for anyone with stones of any size. Left some red spots and my skin felt a little tender, but went away quickly.\n\nGood, close cut.\n\n#### Soap Notes\n*^(Reef Point Soaps - Sandalwood)*\n\nThis base is as awesome as usual.\n\n40 second load with lightly-wet brush + unknown amount water = 5-6 passes of lather. Maybe just 30 sec load next time.\n\nScent: a superb Sandalwood that is not adulterated with other stuff. Good woody scent.\n\nScent Strength: 5/10, wonderfully present during shaving.\n\nBowl - I used the XL version of this bowl:\nhttps://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3392930\n\n\n#### Brush Notes\n*^(Semogue - 1250 Boar)*\n\ngreat little guy with soft tips and medium backbone. Even at 6 uses a nice brush. I'm just soaking it for an hour or so before use, and then letting it dry completely before using it again.\n\n#### Shave Quality\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Few hairs are showing some tip length (with most being cut flush)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm)\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

And bck to the excellent combo of my Nacet and Sheraton.\n\nOh, and I have a sample of the recent tester base from Oz Shaving. If you want to try it and send him back some feedback, just let me know, and I'll send it to you.\n\n#### Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Gillette - Sheraton 1938 ::: Gillette - Nacet ‹123 uses›)*\n\nA little bit of tugging on first pass, but a superior cut all the way around. No irritation at all.\n\n#### Soap Notes\n*^(Lisa's Natural Herbal Creations - Haute Leather)*\n\nCrap this is slick stuff! The third pass was where I got the lather right (first time with it today), and wow, this stuff, IMO, can compete with the top-tier with no problem. Crazy creamy slickness. Not drying at all. I'm seriously going to be looking at her scent list to pick out a few more to put on my ToGet list. Wow.\n\n30 second load with lightly-wet brush + unknown amount of water = 3 passes of lather that worked well, and gave good glide for the razor, but wasn't creamy... and at second pass, I noticed that little bubbles were showing. I had mixed it too thin. But it's a mark of a quality soap if the too-thin lather still works great. So I loaded more from the tub and made a crazy good lather for that third pass. So next time, it looks like I need to load more. Maybe for 40 sec.\n\nThe lather doesn't air up with bubbles at first like so many. Stays creamy and low and builds slowly. Not gluey, though... very nice looking.\n\nScent: straight up leather is about all i picked up. Liked it.\n\nScent Strength: 4-5/10, nicely present during shaving.\n\nBowl - I used the XL version of this bowl:\nhttps://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3392930\n\n\n#### Brush Notes\n*^(Omega - 10098 Boar)*\n\nthe tips follow around my handle, instead of splaying, when swirling on my face. Makes for a lot more work. Don't like that. Tips seem to be slower to split when compared to similar age Semogue boars. But at least it's not prickly any more. But it's not yet comfy.\n\n#### Shave Quality\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Cut flush to where I just see the tips (above average for me)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm)\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

Soap base is what you would expect from Stirling, not amazing the way Reserve or Icarus is but good enough for the job. Like Executive Man, Sharp Dressed is based on a Creed fragrance, Green Irish Tweed (GiT). This is where Stirling knocks it out the park. Having smelled GiT before, SDM is perfect replica of the scent. Aftershave tops it off and lasts for several hours with a solid drydown. For those unfamiliar with GiT, the scent profile is lemon verbena, violet, iris, sandalwood and ambergris. It's a very clean, floral fougere.\n\nI also traded off a set of Roam this week. I found the scent is very similar to Nocturne and I wanted to mix it up. I was lucky enough to find someone who had some spare King of Oud and I'm looking forward to that next week. I hope everyone has a wonderful Sunday.\n\nCheers!\n\nP.S. Using my AoS Pure Badger brush from time to time reminds me how much I dislike that company. I'm grateful that it opened the door for wetshaving, but the products were overpriced and of low quality. It really is a bad brush. One day I'll upgrade to a nice badger brush. For now I have my Maggards synthetic and I'm grateful for that.",

There is definitely a wide variation in opinion/experience with this soap. It's generally accepted that the soap maker reverse engineered the Tabac base and attempted to replicate it. And indeed if you compare the ingredients list, they are nearly identical. They differ only way down near the end of the list. People seem to be in two camps...the Fine soap is good and the Fine soap is not good. I don't question that some people can discern a difference between Tabac's performance and Fine. I am not one of them. In a blind test I would not be able to tell them apart. But I am just a knuckle dragged that can make WMS work good for me, so wtf do I know. Come to think of it, The only soap that I couldn't get to work for me was a puck of TOBS which I suspect was a bad batch. Anyway, I got a really good shave today. And I suspect I'll likely get one tomorrow too with whatever soap I use. I'm just lucky that way.\n\nSunday chores and shit.",

The scent is VERY heavy which I honestly approve of because Beaudelaire is such a wonderful scent. The only problem I'm having is how to actually USE a wax pomade. I've got relatively greasy hair and this stuff is confusing as piss. Yesterday I used a bit less than a dime sized portion and it was WAY too much. Today, I used half of that and my hair already won't stay right. But I'll get the hang of it all eventually.\n\nThis is my first time using Maol Grooming's Heliopteris aftershave and if you like herbaceous scents with a heavy citrus punch at the forefront, you'll love this stuff. There's a lot goin on in the background that I haven't quite been able to put my finger on, but it's still pretty damn wonderful and the face feel is pretty spot on as well. I'll definitely be revisiting this aftershave in the future to see what it does and doesn't really need to play with.",

For $15 shipped, it's great value. The tips are soft, I wouldn't bother to compare to SilkSmoke or Synbad, they are all real soft from what my neophyte hands/face can tell. Where the brush veers from the SilkSmoke and Synbad is it is a bit stiffer/more backbone, while still very springy, push it and it will splay (mind you, nowhere near as much backbone as a badger, but duh). I had to play with it a bit since it doesn't appear to hold water like the SilkSmoke, however even with first use with my typical control soap GSB, I figured it out pretty quick. Not sure this will be an 'everyday' knot for me, but further tests shall ensue.\n\nI did a quick wash with some soap yesterday (even though it arrived with nearly no smell and I probably could have used it), as well as a palm later. Between those two and today, I think it lost 3 hairs, for those curious about that sort of thing.",

I have a nice variability in aggression from the Karve B (least aggressive) plate to the ATT R1 (most aggressive). I'll be using these for a bit before swapping out certain pieces.\n\nThese are my favorite brushes right now - I had a couple bore brushes that I tried but gave away after Sample September, they weren't for me.\n\n**//The Shave**\n\nThe R1 is definitely the most efficient razor I can use for a daily shave. It's really damn smooth but I have to be careful about pressure and angle, especially ATG and when going over areas with no visible lather.\n\nGrooming dept is a top base. The R1 still took nearly all the slickness off after a second swipe without visible lather.\n",

What's the difference between it and my late '47 Super Speed? This one has no notch on the center bar, but has creases on the baseplate like all later versions. There's also a third, earlier '47 like the '46 Ranger Tech, with no notches no crease.\n\nSuper Speeds, like Techs, are vastly underappreciated by the Internet conosciendi, but they're Gillette's longest running models, so they must be good. This one feels just like my other creased Super Speeds, with that eerie lack of blade feel. I went two passes, WTG and ATG, and there was nothing left.\n\nMostho on B&B says the Omega Pro-49 is the best face lathering brush on the planet. I'm not there yet, but I may end up there.",

But the blade is getting duller by each shave. I can probably use it couple more times before it becomes unusable. I'm going to stretch it out. Also, the soap actually lathered this time.\n\n**The Soap** was actually pretty great. First of all, my apologies to all the Nancy Boy Cream lovers out there. It works great with synthetic brush, not a huge boar brush. I believe boars hog all a lot of lather and water and I need to load heavy on the soap/cream. But since this was a sample, I didn't have the luxury of loading heavy. But with a synthetic, I took out couple scoops of the cream and put it on the brush. Lathered on and came out fantastic. Thick, creamy, and slick. All I wanted in a lather. The scent is pretty nice as well. A bit herbal and mediciney but in a good clean way.\n\n**The Razor and Blade** combination did its work. Getting a bit rougher and got a tiny nick but still working fine. Let's test out its next shave.\n\n**The Brush** is actually really nice. Although it is a cheap brush, it works wonderfully. It's got very little backbone but soft and makes for a good lather. It's a great traveling brush or a sample brush as it can take a little sample and make it into a great lather.\n\n**The aftershave portion** was nice. No sting and no irritation. I can still feel some stubbles on my neck but it looks fine on the mirror. No BBS but no irritation. I'll take it. Literally, the same as yesterday. lol\n\nOverall, a decent shave. The cream can be used as both brushless and with brush I believe. Just don't use a big - o - boar brush as you might need 4 X the amount as with a synthetic. Excellent cream, decent blade/razor, great aftershave portion. Good shave.",

First try with this scent, and it wasn't my thing. Good shave with the Nacet today.\n\n#### Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Gillette - Sheraton 1938 ::: Gillette - Nacet ‹124 uses›)*\n\nAs usual for this stage, a little tugging during first pass, but fine after. No irritation. Nice, close cut.\n\n#### Soap Notes\n*^(Ballenclaugh - Crypt)*\n\nThis is a good base with a nice creamy feel and excellent glide. Soap rinses away at a reasonable rate from one's face.\n\n30 second load with lightly-wet badger brush + unknown amt water = 5 passes of excellent lather. I would have zero problem if this soap base was my only one for life.\n\nScent: I *dug* the earth scent in this one. But the sage was there too, and it's just not my thing. Too herby for me, but I'm sure it's not too strong for someone who is either ambivalent to it or, of course, likes it.\n\nScent Strength: 4-5/10, nicely present during shaving.\n\nBowl - I used the XL version of this bowl:\nhttps://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3392930\n\n\n#### Brush Notes\n*^(Declaration Grooming - B5 24mm Hammer & Chisel)*\n\nMan, this guy is almost perfect. so soft are the tips. Splays well enough. Handle could use some improvement in ergonomics, but the poured blank's design is gorgeous.\n\n#### Shave Quality\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Few hairs are showing some tip length (with most being cut flush)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm)\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

Took 47 lathers and I now have a hole about 1cm in diameter. I'm almost done with this blade, I'm going to take it to a nice number but it just doesn't leave my face smooth. I liken it to the cart days where I've used it for consecutive months, the lube strip has run dry weeks ago, you can't see light between the blades, but I'd just push the cartridge just to see if it can take one more shave.\n\nIn other news, I was watching some videos about the beaudelaire re-release and it inspired me to use the limited release pomade I purchased a few weeks ago. The scent is on point, but the consistency is much harder than I expected. It almost feels like Stirling's heel and palm balm, for those familiar. It's solid until you warm it up with your fingertips and then it loosens. I had a hard time simply spreading it about my fingers before applying it, and that should have been a red flag, but still I went to run my fingers through my hair. It was pain from the first moment, and when it was all said and done, I was left with a dozen hairs on my hands. I feel like I probably missed something in the instructions department.\n\nLife is short, shave with good gear.\n",

Objectively one of the worst shaving soaps on the market. But...I still am of the opinion that if you can learn to lather this shit, you can lather anything. Yes, I got a good close shave with it. Yes, it is slick. No, it does not have a good post shave feel. In fact, it is so damn drying to my particularly dry skin that the extra moisturizer I applied had negligible effect. I am going to have to drink extra water today to counteract the drying effect of this soap. I will never recommend this soap to anyone, but in spite of all of it's drawbacks, I'll always have a puck on hand for the nostalgia of it. I imagine my grandfather used it.\n\nMondays suck.",

This scent is a great one for flower lovers, as it definitely transported me to the spring. Fun fact: lily of the valley looks beautiful and smells nice but is poisonous to ingest, as fans of Breaking Bad may recall.\n\nThis was my first use of the unicorn ivory Jefferson, a new brush to the den which I hope will be a permanent fixture. I was pleasantly surprised to discover that the handle has sparkles, hence the term \"unicorn ivory\". I'm probably the last person to find out, but I'm ok with that. It was fun.\n\nSolo parenting again today while my wife is out of town for work, wish me luck.",

Great shave with a great fragrance. Snow is falling gently outside my window, but we're only schedule to get an inch so I'm not filled with hate. Lovely album to listen to. While I generally love The Tallis Scholars due to their work in early choral works, this album highlights a musical style developed by the Estonian composer Arvo Pärt. It's essentially minamilist composition with some stuff going on about music theory that I don't understand, but it is beautiful. And that's what matters.",

I'll wait until next week to post some stuff up since I've got a phone with a better camera on the way.\n\nMy first go around with B&M. Adagio is an interesting scent and the more I smell it, the more I pick up. If I'm honest, I just love the visual of the packaging. The menthol was subtle at first but by the third pass the menthol had really kicked in and felt pretty good.\n\nI'm still sorting out this badger and trying to work out how much I should load. I gave away my maggard synthetic and I really miss it. I've got my eye on a different one and should pull the trigger soon.\n\nI like the Feathers but they don't last long. I was wishing I had put a new one in by half shave. I've got some other samples that need to be tried so I'll play with something new.\n\nHave a great week. Do good.\n\n\n\n",

It's funny what the brain goes in autopilot on, because looking for the orange, it's totally there.\n\nSecond day with the Black Synth suggested by /u/HammurabisTooth. Digging it.\n\nThe Perma-Sharp I had picked up with a bunch of blades I see here that i'd never tried before. I think it's going on about a week and a half, at least in the Tech it's definitely something i'll pick up more of.\n\nI work from home, and the wife and kid are both off school/work this week.

One of my all-time absolute favorite fragrances even though [the bottle](http://www.guylaroche.com/fragrances/drakkar-noir/) is [ugly as fuck.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrp0NqKvoYA)\n\nTried out the Astra in my Tech today. Easy 3-pass BBS shave, zero irritation. Mission accomplished. Even managed to use the alcohol based aftershave without much stinging! I've heard good things about Astra for a long time but never tried them when I was first starting out because I didn't want bad technique to color my impression of them in a negative way. I'm glad I waited until I knew what I'm doing. My only complaint about them is they're very quiet, making it a bit tough to know when they're cutting since they're so smooth. The Wilkinson blades I was using before provided much more audio feedback as I shaved.\n\nEdit: hours have passed. My perfumed wrist still smells amazing. I love it I love it I love it.",

I have, at times, thought this was too aggressive and at other times, not aggressive at all. So I think I have probably just had poor form when using it and got a bad angle. Because it definitely isn't too aggressive or wasn't today. That Oleo Shiloh smells like a million bucks and I always love Oleo's performance. This doesn't disappoint. And Cool aftershave never ever ever disappoints. I love this stuff.",

However, my shave is looking more like a 5'O clock shadow. I do have a darker beard with light skin but Derby blade is not doing the best. Also, soap was a bit disappointing despite my past experiences with it.\n\n**The Soap** worked but it wasn't the best. From my experience with it, I remember having great shaves with it. However this time, it was different. I was able get a great lather but once I started shaving with it, something was missing. The slickness wasn't quite there and the protectiveness wasn't quite there. It's definitely more of a commercial product than a artisan soap for me. I want to like this soap but it performs average in my experience.\n\n**The Razor and Blade** combination did work again. But it's not cutting the stubbles as well as I would like. I'm not sure how long I want to continue this blade. There is a stubborn side of me that wants to keep going but another side is that Derby just doesn't cut well enough. I've had no irritation but sub-par shaves. But for now, couple more shaves will have to do.\n\n**The Brush** was pretty good. The huge boar brush did scritch a bit towards the beginning but it felt fine later. And it still is a lather/water hog. But it is a great feeling brush that I want to continue to break in.\n\n**The aftershave portion** was nice. No sting and no irritation. I can still feel some stubbles on my neck but it looks fine on the mirror. No BBS but no irritation. I'll take it.\n\nOverall, a decent shave. I just can't use the blade if I want a clean look. Tomorrow I'll probably switch it up to a more efficient combo and come back to it later on. The soap is just average but it makes a good enough lather to work with.",

So I busted out a new one, gonna use it for my standard 3 uses, then go back to the 14 uses and compare how it feels and if I need to work on my technique more.\n\nMycroft is such a great scent, my only gripe is that I can't find the matching splash anywhere to go with it. There's a very noticeable difference between this base and the new V2 base in AP Reserve soaps, both are fantastic, just this one (V1) isn't as voluminous as it's younger brother. Might be going to Maggard's this weekend for a little getaway trip with the missus, and gonna be spending a lot of time in the Australian Private Reserve section. Happy Tuesday friends.",

It's kinda weird to rub the soap on my face rather than loading the brush from a puck/tub. But it works just fine. I had plenty of lather for a four pass shave and a little left over. The soap itself lathers easily and performs pretty good. Obviously sticks are ideal for traveling, but I can see how someone could prefer a stick for everyday use if space was limited.\n\nThis is the only Zenith brush I own and man, it's a good one. I have read other people's experience with Zenith brushes, and those experiences seem to be all over the map...too floppy...too stiff...sheds like crazy. I got lucky with this one. I hadn't used it in a while when I used it yesterday. I enjoyed it so much that I used it again today. And there is a reasonable chance I will use it tomorrow.\n\nTuesday's suck only a little less than Mondays. Actually, yesterday was a pretty good day for me. I'll take that shit.",

Well folks, both the complimentary scents and the idea of starting with wetter hair work wonders. The scents just play off of each other and really balance each other out and my hair actually looks like it should and not like I haven't bathed in about two weeks!

It's definitely a keeper and one my wife also enjoyed.\n\nI also killed off the Trinity sample last night. I have really enjoyed the Murphy and McNeil base and the Aventus scent on this one is really great. It's definitely on my to buy list.",

The MLS base used to be top of the heap back in 2016 or so. Now, it is definitely second tier, but still produces a huge amount of very slick lather with relatively minimal loading and water. The protection and post shave is where the base feels old, but even so, I would call this better than Noble Otter in those aspects and roughly comparable to Storybook, so I would say most shavers can still use and enjoy the brand even though the base is no longer cutting edge.\n* And the scent stands out - a great spicy lavender, still very rich and complex despite the three year age of the tub here. Scent has changed a bit over time though, so lacks some of its original vibrancy, but still a very nice smell.\n* **Brush**: Hm, noticed the hulking Tuxedo here did a good job of retaining warmth from the water over the course of the shave, something I ordinarily associate only with badgers. Between that and the still monolithic knot structure (not a single stray hair here after years of use) I would say the 30mm Tux has much to recommend it, even for non-head shavers like myself. The Aurora design is also handsome over time and the impeccable build quality speaks well of the brand.\n* **Frag**: Kouros and myself continue our whole love / hate type thing. Definitely smells more soapy than musky to me, which may be part of the problem for me as I dislike soapy notes in frags. Kouros has a lot going on over time though, interesting development to say the least, and soapy goes away quickly, so there is still hope for a shared future.",

I feel like some of my soaps get a bit neglected especially during winter because I tend toward the warm scent types and not cologne type scents that would usually get use in the summer/spring.\n\nTalbot Valley of Fire is based on Jimmy Choo man. To me it's a melon fruity/tart note on top with a decent dose of ambroxan. Don't have the cologne myself, but the Dunhil Icon paired quite well. The drydown of Dunhill Icon for me is subtle and elegant, while the opening is peppery and fruity - I don't sense as much Amber here.\n\n**//Gear**\n\nI was afraid I didn't get a heavy enough load on the brush but I kept on adding water to this stuff and it was quite enough to finish up my typical 2 passes and cleanup. Super duper slick.\n\nI haven't used the Paradigm in a while but today reminded me that this is one of the smoothest yet most efficient razors I own. Gonna reach for this a lot more now. I feel like sometimes the best stuff you've got may get neglected in pursuit of new stuff. I ought to do some sort of buying hiatus for the short term.\n\nBut Beaudelaire (which I think I'd love but have never gotten the chance to try), new bases, and new artisans (Tatara much?) keep me in the consumer cycle that is this hobby. But it's so so so fun!\n",

A little tugging. No big whoop. Zero irritation. Nice close shave.\n\n#### Soap Notes\n*^(Murphy and McNeil - Mandate of Heaven)*\n\nThis was a very nice lather, and I didn't have to use the full 1/4 tsp of soap to get all I needed. I was very glad that I got the chance to use it. Have heard about it and any hype is probably warranted. Very enjoyable. However, and this is just my own personal issue... it was pretty much a cream... very soft. I just don't do many cream-ish level soaps. So I don't think I'll be grabbing any of these.\n\nI didn't use a post shave product, and they must've put some pretty good stuff in the soap base, because there was no problem with that at all.\n\n1/4 tsp soap + lightly-wet brush + 2 tsp+ water = 5 passes of beautiful, slick, and creamy lather.\n\nScent: It wasn't for me, this one. I got the Mandarin right away, but there was something in this mix that was near-minty-ish.\n\nScent Strength: 4/10, not too weak for me / present during shaving.\n\nBowl - I used the XL version of this bowl:\nhttps://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3392930\n\n\n#### Brush Notes\n*^(Semogue - 1305 Boar)*\n\nThis guy does need to splay more, but the tips are in great shape, even with just 6 uses. Comfy and whipped up a great lather.\n\n#### Shave Quality\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Cut flush to where I just see the tips (above average for me)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm)\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

I guess it's better than nothing. Great shave to start the day but it wasn't too close for my liking. I did a 2 pass with clean up but still felt some stubbles at the end. It was comfortable though.\n\n**The Soap** worked out well. It is one of the soaps that I didn't like but it's slowly growing on me. The mint and basil smell is too strong for me and it is still a challenge. But the performance is great so it makes up for it. The post shave scent is actually nicer than the actual scent for me. Slick and creamy but it has bentonite clay which my skin reacts to (side note. I bought it from WCS and their description did not have bentonite clay -_- ) Anyhow, great soap but I gotta be careful not to leave it on my face too long.\n\n**The Razor and Blade** combination worked well for me. It's not the sharpest blade but it did it's work. Not the smoothest either but smooth enough for me. The razor just feels so right for some reason. It is one of my go-to razor for comfort and ease of shave. However, the closeless is just not there so I prefer a OC sometimes for the cleaner look/feel.\n\n**The Brush** was pretty good. Tuxedo knots are soft but Yaqi puts the knot deeper which makes it have some good backbone. Great brush but 26mm does put it little over the edge for me. I still enjoy it but I prefer 24mm over the 26mm.\n\n**The aftershave portion** was nice. No sting and no irritation. I can still feel some stubbles on my neck but it looks fine on the mirror. No BBS but no irritation. I'll take it. It has been the same for quite a while now.\n\nOverall, a decent shave. Great razor + blade combo and soap was nice to work with. Not my favorite scent but it works. Brush is nice to work with but it does lather a ton which makes the shave a bit messy. Great shave to start the day and great post to end the day.",

      "body": "**Brush:** 24mm Stirling Badger fan\n\n**Razor:** Merkur 39c\n\n**Blade:** Voskhod (2)\n\n**Lather:** Provence Sante - Green Tea\n\n**Aftershave:** Provence Sante - Green Tea + Summer Break Soaps - Shhh!\n\n**Song:** [Primus - Bob](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qjMF5zLbuCM)\n\n*Regarding the music:* I love Primus so much. They are so fucking weird and it's great. This is one of my favorite tracks by them and was the first Primus song I ever heard. A friend played this for me in high school and it about blew my brain out my ass. I had never heard anything like it. The album *Pork Soda* was released in 1993. I was 5 years old. Somehow, I completely missed them until the early 2000's. I love how the song lazily plods along through the verses and then flares up during the \"choruses.\" The lyrics are creepy, the narrator describing his friend Bob that hung himself with a belt in his apartment. Where he lived. And the ending, where Les Claypool devolves into unintelligible hootin' an' a-hollerin'. I never get tired of Primus. Would love to see them live someday.\n\n*Regarding the shave:* I was gonna stick with Mountain Man for another week or so but I got this set in the mail and decided the same shave was for Austere August anyways. Couldn't help meself. I will need to practice with this lather more. It's a hard puck and when I got the package, I immediately threw it in a Maggards jar and did a practice lather with a 26mm synth. I got an absurd amount of foamy suds that took me quite awhile to get under control. Note to self: load less. Okay fine. So this morning, I decided to palm the puck and load it that way and I used a badger and did about half the load time. Still got just a ridiculous amount of suds that took a good 10 mins to get to the consistency that I like, doing a palm lather. I still had so much goddamn lather that *I was storing all the extra on top of my head for the second and third pass.* As hilarious as it looked, it worked. The top of your head, if you're bald, is a great place to put excess lather if you don't use a bowl. I got a little burn from the lather but some of that may have been brush burn from all the stroking. I don't know. Great green tea scent though. The aftershave is non-alcoholic, which I'm usually not a big fan of. I combined it with some unscented alcohol splash and it all felt pretty good but there is no stopper on the green tea bottle and some of it went down the drain. Came out way faster than I expected.\n\nSometimes these things happen.\n\nHappy hump day!\n",

Lots to do, have a cake to pick up later today, house to clean and snacks to prepare. I took the day off work and I'm really looking forward to it.\n\nAs a child, I thought that birthdays were about me, as an adult, I rarely celebrate my own. Instead, a birthday takes on a whole different meaning as a parent. Seeing my daughter born was one of the most special moments in my life. Each year that she is on this earth is a blessing and a reminder that she's a little older and a little less of a little girl.\n\nIn other news, I just found out that I won /u/MadDingersYo PIF. I'll confess, I've never used SBS soap before, so if anyone has any suggestions, I welcome them.\n\nFinally, regarding today's shave photo. In full disclosure I took it yesterday as part of my scotch, watch and wetshaving Instagram page. However, being the layabout that I am, I used the same combination two days in a row.\n\nHave a wonderful Wednesday!\n\nP.S. Anyone else looking forward to the Lather games? It's only three months away.",

It has a bit of a \"barbershop\" opening (apparently), a spicy woody heart, and a base that reminds of Polo Green except without the tobacco notes that I can't stand. I think it would be the perfect '70s-era aromatic fougere for my taste except that it gave my wife a near instant headache... so if I buy it I'll be washing it off my wrist every night when I get home from work.\n\nAfter experiencing very pleasant shaves in my two vintage Gilletes, I moved the Astra to my Edwin Jagger today, which has the most blade-feel of the three safety razors I use. Same close easy shave (BBS in 3 passes, almost no cleanup), but the pointy corners on this razor head still annoy me. Comfortable shave overall any way - practically no irritation, just a little itching afterward. That's acceptable.",

For a classical music lover, it really is extraordinary.

One of my favorite scents from Talbot, a very fresh evergreen with some warmth and sweetness underneath.\n\nThis brush is a beauty that has seen better days, looks like the previous owner left it soaking in water regularly. It definitely will need a reknot as well. A bit sad to see someone's work poorly treated, but I'm glad to have picked it up. I spoke with Chris from brushcraft and he recommended some neatsfoot oil to recondition the horn.\n\nGreat first shave with the Fili, a beautiful vintage piece in perfect condition that just joined my collection thanks to /u/ashbeowolf who also put a very nice edge on it.",

The Windsor gave a confidence inspiring 6th shave today, two pass BBS.\n* Soap: The MLS dupe of ADP. Got the soap before the frag, and did not know that when I got it, as I normally avoid \"our version of...\" soaps. This is a pleasant scent, not as complex as the frag, but trouble free to use and smells a bit like Spring. Like Cape Verde yesterday. the scent has lost a bit of strength and complexity since 2016. But then haven't we all?\n* Brush: Muhle calls this teeny thing a \"medium\" size knot. And the Ford Focus is a \"midsize\"... Still, enough brush for the job, and very efficient.\n* Frag: Business meeting today, so the safe and charming ADP. Which complements the soap well.\n\n​",

Really like the size and heft, and the blue is a nice touch. Decided to take the V3A for a spin again, to see how it would feel after months od developing my technique. It was surprisingly efficient, but really made me appreciate how comfortable the Karve truly is. That seems to be the takeaway from all of my razor experimentation as of late.\n\nNew to me APR soap base should make for an enjoyable one, and I love the look of the tubs. Excited to see how the scent develops once lathererd. Happy hump day!\n\n",

Mostly because I'm on a buying hiatus... Trying to use up some samples I have leftover. The X3 is perfect for times when I'm being super lazy and only shaving a couple times a week.\n\nSherlock isn't my favorite scent ever, but it's far from bad. I think my biggest complaint with the scent is how little of it there is, but CF's soaps are great and pretty easy to work with. I didn't remember the menthol in the aftershave though, and it's rainy and cold in Nashville this morning. Stepping outside after my shave was a little jarring.\n\nGuys living up north where it's super cold and way worse than here, do you all skip out on menthol in the winter or just suck it up?",

I loaded up and jumped in the shower. Worked up a quick and easy face lather. It was nice and slick and I'm a big fan of the powdery Barbershop scents.\n\nI have some blade sample packs and thought I'd try out a Voskhod. Threw a new blade in the razor and went to work. While shaving I thought these blades are pretty similar to the Feathers, which I like. When I got out of the shower, I realized I had actually installed a feather so was at least happy with the consistency.\n\nMy post shave was a Frankenstein's monster of scents with the D503 splash and cooling Nivea. I sprayed on some Stirling Sharp Dressed Man EDT just to keep people guessing. I'm reasonably certain I'm the only person with this combo of scents on their neck ATM so I've got that going for me.\n\nI'm looking forward to a lot of new stuff in the rotation and going to try to figure out how to take decent photos. Because why not obsess about yet another thing.",

Just phenomenal. Don't set my words in stone, but this might have Lavanille beat on scent. I loaded heavy, and I dunked by brush in water 5-6 times between brush strokes to the face. I think I had it dialed in quite well, it tbh it feels like there's no amount of water that'll stifle this soap.\n\n**//Shaving**\n\nThis lather's residual slickness has residual slickness. I kept going over spots multiple times to see if I could break the seal to no avail. I had my ATT R1 close by so I tried a couple swipes (that razor eats slickness for breakfast) - not here folks. I don't know how to describe it.\n\nI was excited, I got careless I thought I swiped myself pretty bad in on the chin. A tiny tiny cut appeared and barely any red stuff. I know soaps where this type of user error would mean a dent in the chin, not so here. But don't get cocky folks, blades can still cut!\n\n**//Fragrance & EDT**\n\nWest Coast Shaving had some errors sending out the full sets of Beaudelaire - long story short the EDT is on the way but didn't show up with the soap and splash. Will follow up on this. In the mean time, Houbigant pairs excellently.\n\n\nOverall such an excellent shave with amazing gear - I feel honored and privileged to be able to have such luxurious mornings almost daily. I smell good!\n",

Ick. Performed well, though.\n\n#### Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Gillette - Sheraton 1938 ::: Gillette - Nacet ‹126 uses›)*\n\nUncomfortable tugging on the first cheek of the first pass. But it was just that my lather was too dry. I fixed it and the rest of the first pass went fine. No irritation. Good shave.\n\n#### Soap Notes\n*^(Wild West Shaving - Private Reserve No. 2)*\n\nMy first time trying a Wild West soap. Performance was good. slick and creamy.\n\n1/2 tsp soap + lightly-wet brush + 3 tsp water = 4 passes of lather.\n\nScent: There were 5 or so things listed in the scent profile, but all I got was Rose during the shave. and it was fairly strong. Sucked. I disliked the scent so much that I just did 2 passes, which I pretty much never do. I just had to get out of grandma's closet.\n\nScent Strength: 5-6/10, horribly present during shaving.\n\nPost shave: I thought a healthy dose of Hallows would bring me back to manliness, but for some reason the rose actually worked WITH it. So if you like dank, dark rose, try combining it with Hallows, eh?

Scrubby but not uncomfortable. It's still young, so that's to be expected.\n\n#### Shave Quality\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm)\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

I did a 2 pass shave with a clean-up pass. WTG, XTG, and the Clean up. The blade is almost done and the soap is as always, amazing.\n\n**The Soap** is one of my favorite and continues to stay that way. The scent + the menthol is so refreshing and no other soap really beats it in that way. Sure it's not the best performing soap but I still love it. It does dry out my skin in the end but the aftershave set-up takes care of that.\n\n**The Razor and Blade** combination did work again. But it is at the end of the road. Even going WTG, the blade was tuggy. This is a bad sign for me and I gotta decide whether to let it go or not. For now, it has one more shave left and it's gone. I didn't have any irritation but felt tuggy throughout.\n\n**The Brush** was pretty good. It lathered up fine but the second pass was a bit thin. It's eating up lather like no other and I expected that. I believe more fatty-based soap works better such as Stirling or DG. It was fine for 2 pass shave but I really need to load heavy next time.\n\n**The aftershave portion** was nice. The Lucky Tiger combo is wonderful. Scent of zesty orange peel + a bit of sunscreen smell from the moisturizer. I love the face tonic but the other one is average. Still, I had no irritation but a comfortable shave.\n\nOverall, a decent shave. A comfortable shave but that Derby Extra has got to go soon. I might change my mind and just try to push it til the 10th shave. Anyhow, no irritation still and I'm satisfied with that result.",

Well, I used it directly after shaving and before I used my normal aftershave, like I've seem plenty of people do on here before, but have never been bothered to try. I regret that laziness wholeheartedly! I LOVE menthol and this balm has just the right amount in it to liven up any shave routine! My face feels wonderfully nourished and the smell wasn't so strong as to interfere with anything else I had goin on this mornin. I'm typically the guy that sneaks a bit of Cryogen in the bottom of my shave bowl and just lathers whatever soap on top of that when I need a menthol fix but I'll definitelu be using this balm quite often as well!",

That's just about the longevity I want from any frag. If you were on the fence about picking this one up, do yourself a favor and do it.",

I got it on Tuesday and did some lathers with it and some of the suggestions left here by some people. It's definitely a bit softer than when I got it but it still needs more breaking in. It held onto Druantia well enough for a 2 pass face lather shave. Added benefit of it feeling like it exfoliated my skin.",

Did well. Very good shave overall.\n\n#### Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Gillette - Sheraton 1938 ::: Gillette - Nacet ‹127 uses›)*\n\nTo be honest, I don't really think this blade has changed much since use 90 or so. Crazy.\n\nAs usual, a little tuggy on the first pass, but all else was good. Just 3 passes and I got an above avg result. Excellent, close shave.\n\nNo irritation. Face feels great.\n\n#### Soap Notes\n*^(Strop Shoppe - Baker St)*\n\nThis was a popular soap a few years ago... for a reason. The lather was excellent. Creamy and slick. Was a bit waxy, but a little went a long way. You only need to use maybe 60% of what you might use of Barrister and Mann, WK, or even Stirling.\n\n1/4 tsp soap + lightly-wet brush + 3 tsp water = 7-8 passes of nice lather.\n\nScent: It was so light, that I couldn't really appreciate it very well during the shave. But it was pleasant. I'd enjoy this soap if I had to use it.\n\nScent Strength: 4/10, somewhat present during shaving.\n\nBowl - I used the XL version of this bowl:\nhttps://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3392930\n\n\n#### Brush Notes\n*^(Zenith - B10 Boar Red)*\n\nGreat brush. Not many uses, but soft tips still. Slowly splitting, like the Stirling boar, but more comfy by far.\n\n#### Shave Quality\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Cut flush to where I just see the tips (above average for me)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm)\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

My first two was over the weekend (using Stirling) while I was away on a trip and they worked out beautifully. This time was the first with B&M. Kept adding water to get a slicker lather but it was thick and dry. Just wasn't able to dial it in nicely. Maybe too much soap loaded on?\n\nAnother change was the use of Astra in the Rockwell. This was my second Rockewell shave. It wasn't as smooth as my first shave with it. The blade feel was a little more than before - both issues likely to do with the lather.\n\nSo all in all, an okay shave. Couple nicks but nothing too harsh. I will definitely continue to try to get a good balance of water/soap going. Seville has generally been pretty easy to work with for me so maybe it's a little different approach for face lather.\n\nPost shave balm is really one of my favs. It's mild, smells clean and goes on easy.\n\nHardware, pre/post shave here will likely be my travel kit going forward. I tend to shave away from home more often so I'm trying to use the nicer razor.\n\nWell that's Thurs (Wed night) report - have a good Thursday.",

I had some lather problems to start which wasn't a huge deal as I was able to add some water and smooth that out. I probably still had some irritation from my last shave, but wanted to see how my face would react to shaving sooner and using a sharper blade in the Feather.\n\nIt was only 2 days growth, but after spending some time not shaving regularly my facial hair seems to grow rather slowly. I've never been a 5 o'clock shadow kind of dude, and I can easily get away with shaving twice a week and not looking too shabby. I don't work in the military or any place that requires daily shaving.\n\nLike many guys though, the hairs on my neck are a constant source of pain. I was hoping the shorter hairs would be caught by the razor more easily and leave less irritation with the combination of a sharper blade. That was not the case. I was cognizant of pressure and technique, but it didn't seem to help. I also did attempt a South to North (XTG) pass on my neck instead of the clean up pass I normally do. This did not seem to be a good idea in the end. I still had several hairs I had to tweeze out of my neck and I have a feeling my next shave is going to be with the cartridge razor so I can let this irritation die down. Which is really a shame as I have a post-war tech on the way that I'm already itching to use.",

It's the only badger brush I still own, and aesthetically pleasing to me so I guess I don't mind keeping it even if it gets infrequent use. Still undecided on whether I will replace RR MF once it's gone. The scent is just OK to me--where it really shines is the post-shave feel. Tons of residual slickness---would be nice if the same base (w/ Fuller's Earth) were available in more scents.",

Also, the soap is growing on me but it is a bit harder to lather in for some reason. 2 pass shave. WTG , XTG/ATG , and Clean up pass.\n\n**The Soap** is one of the most popular Stirling scents and I can see why. It has a great clean scent with a good performance. I think my tub has been dried out a bit longer so it takes a while to lather it. However, it was still slick and protective which is what I wanted.\n\n**The Razor and Blade** combination was pretty good. The razor was aggressive but not too aggressive. The blade was sharp and smooth enough for me. It did tug on my chin a little bit but overall, it was very nice. I love this combination and is one of my favorite set-up.\n\n**The Brush** was surprisingly nice. I remember last time I shaved with this brush and it felt like a plushy ball. But today, it felt more like a quality brush. I am beginning appreciate the silvertip a lot more but I still will not give up on my boars.\n\n**The aftershave portion** was good as usual. No irritation despite the aggressive razor and the WH and Balm moisturized the skin very well. My go-to set-up and it does the job for me.\n\nOverall, a great shave. I still had some stubbles at the end but nowhere as much as the superspeed + Derby setup. I rushed out in the morning so that was unfortunate but I enjoyed the shave throughout the day. Can't wait for the next shave!",

Brought back Stirling Baker St to compare it with yesterday's Strop Shoppe.\n\nI also experimented with putting a bowl in the sink for the water to fill up during my rinses. Then I just rinsed my razor in that water instead of going back to the tap. Really liked it. Faster and easier.\n\nI also switched to distilled for soaking my boars before the shave. I saw some hard water build-up on my soak cup and decided it was time to stop that.\n\n#### Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Gillette - Sheraton 1938 ::: Gillette - Nacet ‹128 uses›)*\n\nchugging along with a minimal tug, comfy shave. Great results. No irritation.\n\n#### Soap Notes\n*^(Stirling - Baker Street)*\n\nThe Strop Shoppe Baker St from yesterday and the Stirling both perform really well, so not much of a difference there. I'd have to give it to Stirling, though, since its strength gave me more to enjoy.?\n\nSlightly rounded 1/4 tsp soap + lightly-wet brush + 3 tsp water = 5-6 passes of sweet, slick, creamy lather. AND, this time, I saw my notes from a previous Stirling mix, and I added 2 tsp of water right away all at once, and just mixed till it was ready.\n\nScent: I mainly picked up a green type scent, and some tart citrus, which I guess is the bergamot.\n\nScent Strength: 4-5/10, nicely present during shaving.\n\nBowl - I used the XL version of this bowl:\nhttps://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3392930\n\n\n#### Brush Notes\n*^(Semogue - 1800 Boar)*\n\nsoft already, after just 7 uses or so. Love it. Holds enough lather when bowl lathering with no problem. The mini-break-in that I'm doing is just to soak it for a few hours prior to its use, and then not using it again for 2-3 days to make sure that it dries.\n\n#### Shave Quality\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Cut flush to where I just see the tips (above average for me)\n\n#### Personal Note\n\nI had to haul up our new-to-us dryer today. Up 1.5 flights of stairs! Muscles will be sore tomorrow! The great news is that we have a dryer now, after ours broke a couple months ago! Finally nice. Craigslist to the rescue! hopefully we found one that will last a few years. So nice not to have to drive to the laundromat!\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm)\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

I'll enjoy em while it's cold and shitty outside though! I went with this scent today because I've got an interview at lunch today. I originally had one scheduled last Friday but the guy that will hopefully be my new boss had a sick kid and was stuck at home last week so here we go again!

The first time I used it I thought the splash was too suede/leather heavy. The soap was (and still kinda is) where it's at for me - it had more of the sweet tobacco accord that I dig. This morning when I applied the splash I got that leather blast again. Two completely different scents, more complementary than similar. Definitely still a soap fan I thought. Well in the 20-30 minutes I've had the splash on, the leather has calmed to a perfect amount where it just sort of exists but is not prominent. Ashbeowulf had said this smells like walking into a humidor and he's absolutely correct. You know how there's a crazy amount of tobacco and \"manly\" scents in wetshaving, always selling that classy rich image of a man with rich tastes (and bank account) smoking pricey cigars and rare whiskey in his den full of rich mahogany and leather bound books? Well, this is that scent. It doesn't smell \"thin\" like so many of those other preblend based offerings. This is the real deal, built from the ground up from quality ingredients and it really shows.",

I like this one a lot.\n\nAstra is still going strong... good. I would be disappointed if it couldn't handle 5 shaves on my pathetically sparse beard. Wasn't paying attention and used too much pressure and realized it half way through the shave... I figured, \"shit, this one's going to be sore when that aftershave hits,\" but nope. Astra + Super Speed is proving to be so gentle on my face that it doesn't even hurt when I screw up. That pleases me.\n\nI still find this giant badger/boar brush harder to use than my semi-petite horse brush. It feels a little softer on my face now, but not much. The Horse brush definitely builds lather faster and better.\n\n**Edit:** Tried on the YSL lNdl'H at lunch. Liked it for about 30 minutes until my nose was more or less on fire. Sandpiper seems fine, but the real YSL is *most definitely a problem scent for me.* Too strong, too spicy. If I were going to wear one of the two as a cologne, it would have to be Sandpiper probably. Just wearing the soap post-shave might be good enough... I can usually still pick up whiffs of this one for several hours after the shave.",

      "body": "[SOTD - PIF Hardware 2/22/19](https://imgur.com/a/xMQNgQZ)\n\nPre - Hot Rinse in the shower\n\nRazor - PIF Black Beauty (O2)\n\nBlade - Feather\n\nBrush - PIF SOC Boar\n\nLather - Chiseled Face - Ghost Town Barber\n\nLoading Bowl - [Jay's Clay](http://www.jaysclay.com/project/natural-shaving-bowl/)\n\nI'd like to thank u/mammothben again for the PIF. Both brush and razor are in great shape and I was able to cross two things off my \"needs\" list.\n\nThis little bowl I bought through Amazon from Jay's Clay is perfect for pushing a small sample down into. It has some spiral ridges on the bottom to hold onto the soap. Be nice if it had a lid though. I just put some Saran Wrap on it if it's going to sit for too long. I use tubs if it's a Stirling size sample.\n\nI've had this Ghost Town Barber sample for too long and now I'm sorry I waited. I bought this as part of the [Barbershop Sample Pack](https://www.westcoastshaving.com/products/barbershop-shaving-soap-sample-pack) from WCS. I promised u/USS-Spongebob I'd ping when I finally got around to this soap so here you go. It was my first time with the boar brush so I underloaded at first. I wasn't pleased so I loaded what should have been the right amount but with the initial amount already there, it was thick. I beat it into submission and ended up with a really nice thick lather. The scent off the puck is powdery clean in a very good way. The powder scent reminds me of Stirling Barbershop but the Ghost Town Barber has much more of the clean soap scent to it. It smells brighter, for lack of a better term. Once it is lathered up the scent really releases. It's not subtle at all. Mrs Cosmo gave me a kiss a couple hours after my shave and said, Wow! Smells nice. The scent sticks around for a long time and I'm happy to be reminded of my shave. A full tub will definitely go onto my \"needs\" list.\n\nThis PIF black beauty is one of my holy trinity of Gillette adjustables along with the Fat Boy and Slim. (Bottom dials, toggles, etc excluded those are their own special breed). It seems much more mild than the Fat Boy. I cranked it up to nine and the mildness combined with the slickness of GTB made we wonder if it was even shaving. Ended up with a nice shave that was super easy. I think the handle could get slick if I'm not careful. There's something I like about the old razors.\n\nI really like this PIF SOC boar brush. It was already broken in so didn't have to go though that. The backbone is perfect for me. Not too floppy but not trying to dig my facial hair out. It lathers well and will be part of my usual rotation. The hairs are golden and consistent. It looks good.\n\nNext on my list is learning the shavette. I'll leave that for Mail Call Monday\n\nTL;DR - Shaved\n\nHave a great Friday. Be good. Do good.\n",

I actually like how it feels, although it definitely isn't an everyday brush. It does do a great job of working up a lather exceptionally fast.\n\n\n",

I'm sure they'll both feel and smell good tho as I've always got good shaves from Glissant.",

You should all be super jealous. :)\n\nGreat shave this morning. It's my first time using anything from West of Olympia and the hype (whatever hype there is) around Garrett's premium base for the Seven Deadly Sins line is absolutely deserved. Maybe I'll post a full review when I get a bit more time, but I have no problem calling this a top tier base that easily rivals the Reserve line from Barrister and Mann. For someone who isn't huge on barbershop scents, I sure seem to have a growing collection of modified barbershop scents. Pride paired quite well with Ghost Town Barber.\n\nGood shaves, all!",

Do you need to spend a lot of cash to have a great shave? Absolutely not. But this is not a bad way to go if you want to blow out the bank account.\n\n\nI was blown away when a friend offered to loan me his WR2, and with much trepidation I accepted. I can understand why this razor is getting rave reviews. It's absolutely beautiful, and the way the cap nestled into the baseplate is satisfying. The shave is excellent, rivaling my favorite razor (CG Lvl2), but requires more attention. I think it's finally time for me to sell/trade my WR1 and hunt for one of these.\n\n\nI love the Rhino scent, but some find it to be a bit much for casual wear. Almond Leather was a nice way to smooth it out.\n\n\nLooking forward to a great weekend!",

I expected more of beer smell to the Soap but it didn't come out. I did two pass, WTG, XTG/ATG, and Clean up pass.\n\n**The Soap** was an interesting choice. I bought it off the Bazaar and was excited to try it out. One reason being that it had Guinness in the ingredient and I wondered how that smelled. But when I smelled it, it smelled nothing like beer but more like chocolate fudge barbershop. It is similar to Stirling Barbershop but a bit more chocolatey. It does have a bit of a dirty smell to it and that might be the Guinness. It performed amazing and I had great shaves with it. The post shave was great as well. I don't know how I feel about the scent but the soap works well. I did have couple tingling on my face but hopefully that's because I shaved daily for the week, not something in the soap.\n\n**The Razor and Blade** combination did work again. I don't have to overbuff some areas but within the two passes, I reduced most of the stubble. I'm impressed with this setup and I'll continue to use it in the future.\n\n**The Brush** was great. I am still having some trouble with later passes though. The boar brush still eats up a ton of lather so I gotta experiment with how much water to use. I started with a damp brush and the first lather was great. But the second lather was a bit thin. I thought I loaded enough but it turned out that I didn't. A challenge but I still love the brush.\n\n**The aftershave portion** was nice. The usual setup that works the best for my skin. I want to try other Stirling Balms too but I got plenty of others to use right now. Later...\n\nOverall, a great shave. I was a bit confused with the Soap scent but I have to use it more and get used to it. I wanted to try the MLS Kraken as well but I didn't have the chance to try it out. Next shave, I'll change up razor + blade and maybe try the cremo shave cream.",

      "body": "SOTD: 23 February, 2019 [\"Gratiot Town Barber\"](https://i.imgur.com/9wSExVe.jpg)\n\n* **Razor:** Maggard MR6 w/ V3\n* **Blade:** Astra Superior Platinum\n* **Soap:** Chiseled Face Ghost Town Barber\n* **Brush:** Maggard 24mm synthetic\n* **Aftershave:** Chatillon Lux Gratiot League Square AS\n\n**Thoughts:** Getting samples is a funny thing. On a recent trade with /u/BadlanderOneThree he offered me a sample of Chatillon Lux GLS. I've not tried it before but the notes indicated tobacco, leather, bergamot and amber. I've been searching for a good leather and tobacco scent for a while and it's really fantastic. Anyhow, I paired the GLS with some Ghost Town Barber. I really enjoyed the combo. I think the pair had enough similarities to compliment each other while being better than the stand alone. Barber balances out some of the musk and amber from the GLS, while GLS enhances smoke and tobacco of Barber.\n\nI had a tough day at work yesterday. Some days you get a bad case and when you get home you just want to go to bed, but you have a family and responsibilities waiting for you as soon as you walk in the door so you don't get to decompress until the kids are asleep. I'll go on a long run later today and clear my head. Speaking of running, I used to swim a lot but recently I switched over to running and I'm actually gearing up for my first half marathon. I just broke 200 miles ran since I started tracking it via a run app and I'm very happy with my transition from swimming to running.\n\nFinally, on the photography front. If anyone has some cryogen that they want to trade, let me know. I have a killer photo planned but it's dependent on something with a ton of menthol. B&M Arctique might work too. Cryogen would be ideal. I'll post up on the trade bazaar later today if no one PM's me.\n\nThanks for hearing me ramble on. Have a great Saturday!\n\nRobot",

Calm wind becoming southwest around 5 mph in the afternoon. High tide at 2:04 this afternoon.\n\nBrush Lathers: 25\n\nGot the EdT in the mail last night so that decided my shave for this morning. First impression on the initial blast is \"earthy licorice\". It's sort of off-putting, but will have to see how it ages during the day. Shave was okay, need to get the ratio down more.\n\nHave a nice Saturday everyone!",

It is not for everyone. It's straight Haitian Vetiver with a hit of menthol. That's it. Simple and straight forward. And I love it. As far as I know, this was a limited release and has never been repeated. That's a damn shame for vetiver lovers.\n\nNow it has been established that I prefer boar brushes over all others in a general sense. However, *this* particular badger brush stands out from all of my other badgers by a wide margin. I have several badgers, but none of them have the characteristics this one does. I guess that gives evidence of the variation in natural fiber. This one gels like crazy and has an ideal amount of backbone for my preference. To me, this is the perfect badger brush. I don't see me ever buying another badger. I don't see how this one can be topped. As I said before, I prefer boars over all others. I always will, but I like *this* particular badger better than all but two or three of my boars. And who knows, maybe with more use this particular badger may become my favorite brush over all brushes...period.\n\nSaturday stuff awaits.",

I didn't have to referee once. The little dog goes apeshit when the neighbor walks their poodle by our house (how dare they). My daughter's visiting giant dog hears barking, goes into full-on attack mode and makes a beeline for the little dog to see what's going on and to help. He either steps on or lands in the little guy, who gets pissed and snaps. The big guy never retaliates, but dogs are dogs, and anything can happen.\n\nThe shave was perfect. You can never go wrong with anything Italian when it comes to shaving. This all-stainless X-Razor shavette is my biggest surprise. It has monster exposure, but just sits right in the hand. This one demands solid technique. Unfortunately, the all-aluminum version seems to have been discontinued. They now make the same razor with a plastic handle and stainless everywhere else. The original Floid Blue, my last bottle, capped off a wonderful shave.\n\n/u/MadDingersYo - you could have been shaving with this badass looking razor if shavettes worked for you.",

Love SV soaps! Tried Manna Di Sicilia for first time.\n\n#### Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Gillette - Sheraton 1938 ::: Gillette - Nacet ‹129 uses›)*\n\nfirst pass felt a little smoother than usual. Maybe putting a little lather on as a pre-shave, something I usually don't do, helped.\n\nAlmost no tugging this time, how about that? No irritation. Just a very nice shave.\n\n#### Soap Notes\n*^(Saponificio Varesino - Manna di Sicilia)*\n\nWhat I liked about this soap, which I'll definitely be keeping around, is that it took some elements I dislike ... sage, clove, rose, and amber ... and worked them into a wonderful blend with orange, cedar, tobacco flower, and patchouli to make something truly greater than the sum of it's parts.\n\n20 second load with lightly-wet brush + 2 tsp water + some bloom water (from blooming several mins) = 6-8 passes of magical, amazing, slick, cushiony lather. The lather was a thing of beauty after first pass adjustments.\n\nScent: the tart orange/bergamot and rose are easy to pick up, but if you smell carefully, you should get many of the other notes. The femininity of the rose is tempered by the clove, sage, and sweet amber and patchouli, into something really enjoyable.\n\nScent Strength: 4-5/10, lightly, but enjoyably present during shaving.\n\nBowl - I used the XL version of this bowl:\nhttps://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3392930\n\n\n#### Brush Notes\n*^(Semogue - 1250 Boar)*\n\ncomfy brush. doesn't really need more break in. Will be amazing when more tips split! Does it's job really well.\n\n#### Shave Quality\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Cut flush to where I just see the tips (above average for me)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm)\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

The wife and I were trying to remember all 7 over dinner last night. WoO has already released Envy, Lust, and Pride. We pretty quickly came up with Sloth, Greed, and Wrath but it took us a long time to remember Gluttony (ironic since we were sitting in a restaurant full of people stuffing themselves). While I have no idea what WoO has in store for the final 4 scents, I am currently speculating that Gluttony will be a gourmand while Sloth will be unscented (because he's too lazy to come up with a scent for it). I maintain that this base is very comparable to Barrister and Mann's Reserve base and I'll definitely be looking out for the next 4 drops.\n\nIn non-shave-related news, I've officially made my first contribution to an open source project. The good folks behind PRAW (Python Reddit API Wrapper) accepted my [pull request](https://github.com/praw-dev/praw/pull/1031). I'll probably never make a tub of soap or turn a brush handle, but it's very satisfying when you make a thing and people like it.\n\nGood shaves, everyone!",

The blade jumped and I applied just enough pressure to slide right under the skin on my XTG pass. I have a 1/2 cut on my cheek and boy did it hurt. Rinsed it out and kept going over it with the styptic pencil, but needless to say the shave was over. Other than the incident, I really enjoyed the blade and I felt like some of the other shaving angles are getting easier. I just have to keep respecting the blade.\n\nI haven't used Dapper Dragon in awhile, and forgot how well it lathers. Didn't take long to get enough lather for 3+ passes. The scent is okay, but it gets dominated by the anise note. Scale polish is easily one of the best post shave products I have used and is a good change of pace.\n\nToday I received (https://imgur.com/Uksul2b) an amazing lather bowl from Doug Smith Pottery on Etsy. The photo is a stock from the listing, I will take some photos of my own when I get chance on my days off. This bowl exceeds expectations and works perfectly. Plenty of room for the lather, fits great in my large hands, and looks terrific.",

Tried Unconditional Surrender for first time today. Liked it.\n\n#### Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Gillette - Sheraton 1938 ::: Gillette - Nacet ‹130 uses›)*\n\ntugging was very minimal today, even by a non-marathoner's criteria. NIce comfy shave with great results. No irritation or weepers.\n\n#### Soap Notes\n*^(L&L Grooming/Chatillon Lux - Unconditional Surrender)*\n\n30 second load with lightly-wet brush + 3 tsp water = 6 passes of creamy slick excellent lather.\n\nScent: Just got a pine tar or fresh rubber type of scent, which I really liked.\n\nScent Strength: 4-5/10, nicely present during shaving.\n\nBowl - I used the XL version of this bowl:\nhttps://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3392930\n\n\n#### Brush Notes\n*^(Omega - 10098 Boar)*\n\nNot prickly, but I woulnd't use this brush, at this young age, when using an aggressive razor, since you might get some brush burn. Otherwise, it was okay. Just waiting for this guy to have those tips split more.\n\n#### Shave Quality\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Cut flush to where I just see the tips (above average for me)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm)\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

      "body": "[SOTD: 24th of February, 2019 \"King of Oud\"](https://i.imgur.com/BgXfqRv.jpg)\n\n* **Razor**: Rockwell 6s\n* **Blade**: Astra Superior Platinum\n* **Soap**: Wholly Kaw \"King of Oud\"\n* **Brush**: AoS 22mm Pure Badger\n* **Aftershave**: Wholly Kaw \"King of Oud\" AS Toner\n\n**Thoughts**: Today was my first chance shaving with KOO thanks to a trade with /u/reut0. The trade went very smooth, excellent communication all around. In exchange for his KOO, I gave him my Leviathan. I wish I had cared more for the scent. Performance was great, but I never fell in love with the coffee and leather notes. King of Oud however is awesome. The scent is really complex. Spice, Oud, Rose, Amber. It was very strong off the puck but once it lathered, the smell softened and became very nice. Interestingly enough, I think the KOO aftershave notes are slightly different. This doesn't bother me at all because I think it enhanced the soap. Rose notes became stronger, the spice was scaled back somehow. It's very nice. Quality of the shave is top notch and exactly what you would expect from Wholly Kaw.\n\nIn other news, I decided to finally start an Instagram account dedicated to my wetshaving photos. I've been posting some crossovers on my watch page for a few months, but I'm coming to find I take a lot more shaving photos than watch photos now and I wanted to showcase it. I'm not looking to self promote, so I won't post my IG link, I simply wanted to share my thoughts.\n\nIn closing, I wanted to tell you guys how much I enjoy these daily shave posts. Sometimes I talk about life events, shaving or just general musings. I only found this subreddit four months ago, but I really feel part of the community. People like /u/MadDingersYo and /u/Ugmug have been so welcoming and it has made me want to jump in feet first.\n\nCheers!",

There may be five shaves left, but no more. I think I'm going to run through my MLS soaps starting today and maybe kill this sample in the process.\n\nI don't know how many lathers this knot has on it, but it is noticeably better than when I first dropped it into this handle.

Cute little red tub of soap and cute little horse brush... Such a good combo. Lathers like a beast and performs quite well. Also, I think this Vie Long is still softer than my badger/boar... I sure hope that thing \"breaks in\" soon or else I'll be selling it because it's too big and heavy for my taste and the lather release seems awful to me. Maybe I'm not approaching that brush the right way, because I don't know how all the folks around here use such giant brushes.\n\nWas trying to go fast with this shave. Didn't end up saving much time and I can definitely feel more whiskers afterward than usual. Hmmmmmmmm. It looks perfectly presentable, but I can already tell my whiskers will catch in my scarf if I leave the house today. I know spring is on its way for some of you, but up here in Saskatchewan it's still a frigid -45° with the wind.",

It's proving harder than I thought to try to tame it. Will likely go back to it at some point, as I'm too stubborn to know when I'm beat.\n\nThe Charcoal was much more pleasant with this Personna than the Perma Sharp. Maybe it was the more mild blade, maybe it was b/c it has been dulled by a number of uses. Either way, not complaining, so I guess more blade experimentation will be in my future.\n\nSmooth Sunday shaves everyone!",

We we're up and down all night with our 6th month old that's cutting a tooth. So at 5:30 this morning I decided I wanted to shave. Usually I use my B&M Lavender to shave with at night.\n\nThis is the second time I have used the Noble Otter and I love it. Such a rich smell. I'm still deciding if the Voshkod are for me as it's only my 5th shave with them.\n\nAnyway, that morning shave is making this day with students much better. Please, excuse formatting and such as I am on a yellow hotdog with 21 High School students on our way to a play clinic. Wish me luck, I get to watch them butcher Trojan Women.",

WTG, XTG, Clean up. I changed most of the products and I enjoyed it. The blade turned out fine and the soap performed well. Not my favorite scent though.\n\n**The Soap** was an interesting choice. I bought it from the Bazaar along with the MLS Drunken Goat. It shares a similar characteristics of a sweet aroma from the coffee and green scent from the tobacco. On paper, it sounded like I would like the scent but it turns out that I don't. The tobacco reminds me of smelling pot off the street and it's just not my cup of tea. It performs amazing though; creamy and slick lather that gave me a great shave. It'll potentially be a part of my soap cycle but let's wait and see.\n\n**The Razor and Blade** combination was actually good. I had a bad impression of the Parker 26C because it was paired with a Derby Extra blade. But with the Rapira Platinum Lux, it did not drag across the skin and I barely felt the blades. It felt similar to the Astra Green and gave me a good shave without irritation.\n\n**The Brush** is breaking in even more. Today, it felt similar to a 2-band badger and there was barely any scritch. It felt like a natural hair brushed against my face and it was very enjoyable. I could not go in big circles since it's a big brush but within reason, it was a fast lathering experience. Great brush that I want to continue to use.\n\n**The aftershave portion** was nice. I haven't used the Alum because of the daily shaves but it did its work very well. It tightened the skin without irritating or drying it more. With the Stirling Balm, my skin was well moisturized and I was ready to head out.\n\nOverall, a decent shave. A comfortable shave despite the OC razor and I used a great performing soap. The scent isn't my favorite but I'm gonna give it some time. Great combination for the razor and blade. I think I'll enjoy using Rapira Platinum Lux in the future. In conclusion, good shave.",

These blades are about as useful to me as Rapira Platinum Lux, one and done. The only beneficial part for me is the lack of wax.\n\nAnyway, nice chilled out shave today, basically 2 passes, I can't stand this blade any longer to follow through with a third pass or cleanup. Good riddance!\n\nHope everyone is having a nice weekend.",

Went with the Game Changer and the rest of the shave was on cruise control. Such a comfortable, effortless shave. If I had to pick one DE to keep, it would be this one. It just works with all blades I've tried and gives me great results.\n\nThe Gillette Silver Blue has worked for me in every DE I've tried and is still going strong at 7 uses. Most blades last around 5 for me before I get some tugging.\n\nMy love for Noble Otter and their scents has not diminished in the least. Every time I use Two Kings and can smell it on my skin hours later. It's just a terrific fragrance. Hope everyone has a great week!",

However, that could be due to the fact that I over-hydrated the lather... or maybe the 23-use Feather that was in the chamber. However, the feather was still so sharp that it gave me a great cut, and one stealth weeper that I didn't even see coming. Other than the weeper, there was no irritation.\n\n#### Soap Notes\n*^(Eufros - Ylang Ylang)*\n\nI pushed it to a pretty good-looking point of elasticity, but it kinda stayed dry nonetheless. A few soaps have done that with me. It looks like I need to stop hydrating this one before I usually do.\n\n30 second load with lightly-wet brush + 3.25 tsp water = 3-ish passes of dry-ish lather that had to be rescued with another run to the tub, and a bit more water.\n\nScent: Very nice, but not sophisticated enough to fetch the premium price tag that this soap usually commands. From the label, it looks like this was old packaging, so take that for what it's worth. The Patchouli served well to ground the orange and ylang ylang.\n\nScent Strength: 4-5/10, lightly present during shaving.\n\nBowl - I used the XL version of this bowl:\nhttps://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3392930\n\n\n#### Brush Notes\n*^(Semogue - 1305 Boar)*\n\nsoft tips that were welcome today as I had to rebuild the lather and do more brushing than usual. No brush burn. Comfortable and enjoyable.\n\n#### Shave Quality\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Cut flush to where I just see the tips (above average for me)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm)\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

I know they're not all made equally, but I'm not a fan of this particular brush. Lather flies everywhere. It was hard to keep it from flopping, and I learned if I kept my left hand out in front of me, odds are it would catch the flying lather. The shave was good, but I could feel the blade a little more today than my last two shaves with NO, so I wonder if it's the lather.\n\nLife is short, shave with good gear.\n",

Through a comedic series of events, the roll up door to their rented storage unit fell directly on the top of my head HARD, causing my teeth to obviously smash together real hard and broke about four different teeth (or fillings out of teeth, I truly am not sure which was which). Thankfully, I already had a dentist appointment scheduled today and should be getting this fixed this morning. With that in mind, I decided not to go crazy with any scents and just stuck with the full on FitD set. Speaking of which, I've got a massive hole in the middle of the soap that's slowly growing larger as time goes by. It's crazy to see the bottom of a tub!!!",

High tide at 3:58 this afternoon.\n\nBrush Lathers: 27\nToday felt a little bit softer with the brush than yesterday. Enough so that it was noticeable.\n\nThis is a nice soap and haven't used it in a bit. I think that the scent is starting to deteriorate from the tin, either that or I am coming down with a head cold. The splash burned a bit, but I think that's because this blade has been rough the last couple of shaves. Gonna give it a few more to see if it smoothes out, if not will be time to bin it.\n\nHave a nice Monday everyone!",

It's possible. It was shipped between Ozark Mountain and Sandpiper and it might have picked up some fragrance from them at the surface. I'm going to shave with it all week (maybe) and see if it improves / gets less incense-y to me as I burrow down into the puck. Already today it's noticeably more floral and less incense-y. Still reminds me a bit of walking into Spencer's Gifts post-shave though. I'll give it a few more tries and then update my big Stirling scent review I posted over the weekend.\n\nNice smooth 3-pass BBS today with the Tech. I think this Astra is fading a bit for sharpness a few shaves before the Wilkinsons did, but that makes sense because I felt like the Wilkinsons started out a little sharper anyway. Considering the price difference in the blades, though, the Astra works out to about half the price per shave.",

Felt like I needed to add more water than usual to get a nice slick lather. However, performance is fantastic. Scent is mild and I actually enjoy it quite a bit - doesn't last long after the shave. The post-shave feel of the soap is very nice - not dry at all.\n\nRockwell 6S is really a joy to use. I'm getting used to the balance and can find the sweet spot for blade angle quickly. I am considering giving plate 4 a try quite soon. 3 Passes on last night's shave.\n\nNow the Stirling Spice AS balm: Thick consistency which takes a little longer to work into the skin. The smell - reminds me of talcum powder, which is okay I guess. However, the GF was not impressed - it reminded her of *baby diaper that needed changing*... Needless to say, I had to wash this out and mask with something else before being allowed into bed. Lol. Lesson learned - this is going in the \"don't use at GF's place\" pile.\n\nHave a good Monday folks!\n\n",

I'll be following the advice given by u/NeedsMoreMenthol and just stick to the cheeks for the time being.\n\nThis is my first go with BarrBarr and Noble Otter. As usual, I loaded too much and had enough lather for my up and down cheeks. I really like this scent. The oak moss and rosemary combined with some slight citrus has hitting me with an apple cider smell for some reason. Could just be a flashback from my childhood and the old dank buildings out at Tanners Orchard in the fall. Once I got enough water in there to compensate for me eager loading, I had a really thick, great smelling, slick lather. Probably should have stuck with something more familiar since it was the first time with the new razor but I was too excited to try it.\n\nThe shavette went ok. I stayed on the cheeks with only a quick deviation to the sides of the mouth. Again, impatient. It was awkward as might be expected. I had trouble seeing what I was doing and my hands need to learn to follow direction. I need to find some more videos and will now be able to pay attention to the things I found challenging. All my DE practice really prevented me from the more common mistakes. Looking forward to more razor time.\n\nHave a great week. Do something nice for someone and don't tell anyone you've done it.",

I no longer use anything else from a razor and blade perspective and I will be do a giveaway for the final razor in my den this week.\n\nFinished using the samples of B&M Vespers last week and moved on to a sample of DG Cuir et Epices. I loved the performance of the Excelsior base and thought it was amazing in terms of scent, slickness and post-shave feel. But HOLY BISON, DG's bison tallow base took the slickness and post-shave feel to another level (several levels in fact). This thing was so slick and had amazing residual slickness. The post-shave was excellent and I didn't need anything other than cold water. Mind. Blown.\n\nI purchased a DG Sellout soap and aftershave set on the Bazaar yesterday and am really looking forward to using DG's Icarus base. If the bison base is this amazing, I can't imagine what the Icarus base will be like...\n\nDG bison: Best.Soap.Base.Ever.",

It gives a great efficient shave and feels smooth during all passes, but in 3 of 5 uses so far, it give me a \"mystery weeper\", a wound not explicable from technique failure. Happens sometimes with some blades where the QC is a tad off. It's not a bad blade, certainly lasts a while, and is a good value, but I find too many other brands are as cheap, as efficient, and less likely to cause me to dig out the first aid kit post-shave.\n* Soap: Love the performance, but the scent goes from mild in the tub to non-existent once lathered. A shame for me personally as I like mid to strong scents, but I guess Tunisia at night is a pretty mellow olfactory experience! Will try the brand again, as the vegan performance is excellent - better than CB, better than even Glissant (tallow), and is matched only by WK's vegan base among cow friendly soaps. Needs more oomph in the scent mix in my book, but if you like mild, pleasant scents, here you go.",

WTG, XTG, Clean up. Comfortable shave but the brush is still a bit scritchy. Soap is always a pleasure to use and great aftershave setup.\n\n**The Soap** is really great. Even though it is quad-milled soap, it lathers with no problem. I had to work in it with drips of water but at the end, I had a great lather to work with. Gave me good protection and good slickness. It is not the best but it is better than the average. It also smells really nice. Soapy and floral/citrus scent that I enjoy.\n\n**The Razor and Blade** combination worked out again. The blade is working fine on its second use and the razor worked well. The longer handle didn't phase me and I enjoyed the combo.\n\n**The Brush** is an interesting choice. This horse hair is tough to work with because it is scritchy. I tried to soften the bristles but it seems like that it'll take a long time. It's shedding more hair than the average and the handle has couple thin cracks. I did drop it in the sink a couple times but I didn't expect to see crack because of that. Overall, I would not recommend this brush but it was a good experiment for me. I don't regret buying it because it can be a lot better in the future. Let's hope so.\n\n**The aftershave portion** was nice. The usual Witch Hazel + Stirling Balm works out well for me. Smells nice and my face feels amazing. Can't expect more than that.\n\nOverall, a good shave. The razor and blade feels comfortable and efficient at the same time. The soap performed well and smelled really nice. The brush was still scritchy but I'm hoping to tone it down and soften it through continued use. And as always, good aftershave combo. I'll use some mass produced soap next shave and pair it with some new soaps that I got.",

I would also be remiss if I did not thank Kyle ( /u/rocketk455 ) for a thoughtful handwritten note and a huge lot of additional samples including some of his personal supply of Cannonball AS.\n\nNow onto the shave itself. Once upon a time I vaped. I don't think it's the best of habits, but that's a discussion for another day. My point is that my favorite vape liquid was Reds Apple eJuice. The smell was clean, crisp macintosh apples with a bit that tangy, sharp bite you would expect from a fresh picked apple.\n\nThat's Teachers Pet. Kyle, forgive me for comparing this to a vape juice, but that was the memory that came to mind. The scent is absolutely fantastic and you nailed apple essence. The croap is medium soft and [lathered easily](https://i.imgur.com/Xv7oic2.jpg). I did not find it really thirsty. Slickness was also very nice.\n\nAftershave scent seemed to mirror soap scent. Some companies seem to make their aftershaves complimentary as opposed to identical to the soap scent. The aftershave was moisturizing and the scent has lingered the last two hours since I shaved.\n\nI have to say, this is an excellent soap base. I don't want to compare it to others as this is only my first shave with it, but I would ascribe this as a \"safe recommendation\". It won't be the most exciting scent (Night Music, Texas on Fire, Leviathan, ect) but I don't think it will be offensive to anyone either. I think this is firmly a unisex scent and is not limited to a single season. A bit of Bay Rum AS would change the entire feel of the soap and make it a apple pie take on a winter scent.\n\nThanks for reading my mini review of Summer Break Soap \"Teachers Pet\"!\n\nHave a great Tuesday!\n\nAll items were either personally owned or given to me for a PIF.",

Huh, why is it overflowing? Water started coming out shower drain, and it sure wasn't clear, smelled terrible. Now, I'm not a generally handy guy, but I can Google with the best of them. Sounds like a clogged main sewer line. Call up RotoRooter and they won't be able to make it out until tomorrow morning. Lovely. So, with water all over the bathroom floor, I grab some towels and start wringing them out in the shower. At least that water was not coming back up for now. Luckily, my parents only live a few minutes away, so by the time the coffee kicked in, I was able to go over their for the morning constitutional and a shower.\n\nI decided to have a shave later back at home using cold to lukewarm water in a big mixing bowl. Actually worked out pretty well. Just had to make a stop outside to throw water out a few times to use my tools. I hate days where I don't get to shave unless I'm trying to get some more stubble for a specific reason. Let's hope tomorrow is a better day.",

I am familiar with the quality of WK soaps, so today's run was all about scent.\n\nRight off the sample I got a tounge tingling whiff of ozone and water. Not as light scented as I have read, but pulling a deep sniff straight from a sample that was stuck in a ziploc bag and mailed usps might have stacked the deck a bit. Not unpleasant in any way. I didn't pick up any earthiness, which is exactly how I was hoping it would be.\n\nAs I lathered, I picked up more of the earth tones. It never overpowered the other scents, like in my experience with Summer Storm. The scent did fade to something lighter. Still completely noticable, but not as intense as my first incounter. Scent strength was 4/10 through the entire shave. Always there in a pleasant way, but never overpowering.\n\nThe splash was, for my nose, all ozone and menthol with very little water or earth scent. I normally don't do well with menthol, but this worked. I have little exposure to mentholated splashes so I cannot really compare it to much else. It was cold, but not fridged.\n\nPerformance was top notch as usual with WK soaps. I didn't need to rush into my post shave routine, but enjoyed the wonderful softness which is typical for WK. Glad I got to give this scent a run, but will need another shave or two with it before I can make up my mind about it.\n\nTL:DR - Great performance. Scent was mostly ozone, then some water, then some light earth. Splash was really mentholated but pleasant and boosted the ozone scent from the soap.",

I love the Icarus base, but I look forward to getting a tub in a more loveable scent. (Side note: I have a couple sets of Harmony, but I bought them on scent alone, and it turns out it irritates my face quite a bit.)\n\nSpeaking of \"too much out there\": Fenchurch is balls-deep amazing. Why I've only used this a few times is a complete mystery to me. Hopefully I learned something today and will continue using it.\n\n\nThe handle on my brush makes my hand hurt. That's probably why I rarely use it. It's too damn big. I like the knot though.\n\n\nAnd for those with a keen eye: Yes, I noted that my Karve plate is straight bar, because not only is the open comb plate now available, but I have a few on the way. I'm waaaaaaay too excited about it.\n\n\nAnywhoo, keep it real, fellas. Great shaves to all.\n\n\n\n",

High tide at 5:00 this evening.\n\nBrush Lathers: 28\nStill getting better but my other brushes are starting to call my name.\n\nFirst pass was lack luster. But that was mostly due to user error. I don't use this base very much because this is the only Noble Otter soap that I own. The second pass was much better, got it properly hydrated. I think the scent is really one of the reasons that I don't use it that often, it's a great scent, but just one that doesn't really tick the boxes.\n\nHave a nice Tuesday everyone!",

The whole flap reminded me of this soap, which has a creamy tea scent that's just perfect for me. Despite his erratic mad scientist approach, Mo knows how to make a fantastically slick soap that ticks all the marks. Don't get me wrong, there are GD soaps I've absolutely despised (looking at you, Flight), but this one is a winner.\n\nThe real star of the show was the Noble Otter Monarch splash. Not only is the formula excellent, DAT SCENT. Oof, it's wonderful. I'm not sure if Cody plans to put out any edt, but this would be a great candidate.\n\nLately I'm getting better shaves with my straights, which is surprising to me. I think it may be because once I settled on my favorite DE, the CG Lvl2, I may have gotten a bit careless using it. I pay more attention when using a straight, which naturally means a better shave.\n\nThe Declaration B2 knot on this beautiful handle is a stunning top notch performer.",

      "body": "Tuesday 2/26 SOTD\n\n* Razor: ATT Windsor Copper R1\n* Blade: PermaSharp (6)\n* Soap: B&M Fougere Aromatique WL tallow\n* Brush: Paladin 26mm Sumo\n* Post: PSC Caffeinated After Shave balm\n* Frag: B&M Fougere Aromatique EDT\n\nProduct Notes:\n\n* **Razor / Blade**: No weepers today, making PermaSharps 1 for 2 in the odds of inflicting unjustified injuries. Very efficient shave though!\n* This is the 22nd consecutive shave on the Windsor, and the 14th month of ownership, and the patina, such as it is, still is little more than ugly looking flyspeck dots. So the razor no longer looks as nice as when it was new, and does not have Ye Olde Vintage Appeale that a nice full surface patina would grant. I guess this is the downside of owning reactive metal razors - there's a lengthy \"horse latitude\" period where the razor just looks fugly, at least unless you play around with egg yolks to boost the patina or just keep it polished as if new.\n* **Soap**: Like the cartoons where incoming Baby New Year meets the decrepit ancient Old Year on his way to oblivion, the brand new EDT met the elderly WL soap that is just beginning to show the ring of death. The soap still has maintained its scent really well for a six year old product, and the WL shave is still highly competitive in today's market, at least for we soft water users. Shame this will apparently (?) not be made again, as it works well as a soap scent.\n* **Brush:** Paladin continues to amaze me - the beautiful jade finish looks brand new, the brush has not a single stray hair, nor has lost even a strand, and the knot loads and delivers soap with synth like efficiency. I would say I prefer this even to my Declaration B1, which a) cost more, b) has a much duller handle, c) has lost a few hairs here and there, and d) has developed a few close to horizontal outlier hairs. (Simpsons do the same thing, so hardly a black mark on the Declaration, but the absence of such a trend in the Paladin impresses me.)\n* **Frag**: Wow! So much amazing stuff here. Takes the excellent scent of the soap and adds rich complexity - the cardamom is very more perceptible here and really makes the scent. Plus for a natural perfume, the FA has excellent strength, projection, and (so far) duration, all of those challenging things to achieve with only natural elements. Another boringly perfect work of genius from B & M! : D",

I always found I had to do more cleanup than I wanted with the .68 gap. The .84 solves for this for sure. There's a tad more blade feel but the thing is still so smooth. It was especially better at taking down my neck stubble where there's a little bit of growth randomness. awesome shave overall. This thing is going to see some time in the rotation, not just during travel.\n\nI also picked up the super knurl handle which feels extremely secure in the hand. It does make the experience somewhat handle heavy though.\n\n**//The Setup**\n\nI can't get enough of my B5...it's top dog in the rotation. Beaudelaire is an excellent soap I really enjoyed the scent and the performance again today. It's also extremely easy to use and dial in, which is much appreciated in a bass with so many ingredients and fats.\n\nIt's been a rough week so far. 10 month old has been stuffY nosed and miserable. She woke up with a smile today though! Great start to the day. Happy Tuesday folks!",

      "body": "Last night's shave:\n\n**Prep:** Washed face with knock-off CerVe\n\n**Brush:** Yaqi Mysterious Space Timberwolf\n\n**Razor:** Post-War Gillette Tech\n\n**Blade:** Feather (2)\n\n**Lather:** Stirling Barbershop\n\n**Post Shave:** Witch Hazel, Lucky Tiger, and Cetaphil cream post shower\n\n\nTL:DR - Bought a post-war Gillette Tech last week that gave me the best shave of my life on the same Feather blade that tore up my neck in my EJ DE89.\n\nI didn't make mail call Monday yesterday, but I bought this Tech (NDC, oval holes in the base plate) on the bay last week and cleaned it up over the weekend. I got kind of enamored with the idea of trying a tech after reading up on them and the fact that they're supposed to be even less aggressive than the DE89 and I kind of liked the idea of finding one as old as my parents. Unfortunately, I missed out on anything specific from ShaveHQ's last drop so I started watching the bay.\n\nThe razor cleaned up nicely with only a few spots of tarnish and one spot where it looks like the plating was chipped or scratched. The chip/scratch is on the baseplate, but it's tiny and in a spot that doesn't actually go over my face. I haven't even used polish on it yet so everything besides the chip/scratch may buff out eventually. Either way, there was no reason not to test drive this bad boy out so I dunked it in alcohol while I picked my wife up from the airport.\n\nMy last shave was about 5 days ago and terrible so I was thankful to be able to work from home yesterday and give my face another day to heal up. Once I fished the razor out of the alcohol bath and dried it off I loaded it up with the Feather blade that I hated in my DE89. I figured what better way to test out this razor than using the same blade that I despised in my DE89.\n\nLathered up and went to work - Best. Shave. Ever. I'm still giddy over how close this razor got without the normal irritation I end up with on my neck. I did manage to go a little too far in a couple spots, but that was me getting greedy and in different spots than I normally have issues with. Additionally, even after 2-3 passes on my neck plus clean up I usually find a few hairs later on that need to be tweezed out, but this razor seemed to get everything.\n\nBesides the razor being new there are a few things I'll need to pay attention to going forward:\n\n* I did wash my face with soap pre-shave which I normally just do with water so that may have helped soften my beard up a bit more than normal.\n\n* I usually have better luck with blades on their 2nd shave so this could've been a fluke combined with the slightly less aggressive razor.\n\n* I've been using my synthetic brush more lately to get a better feel for it and this was probably the best lather I've gotten from it. I don't think this is much of a factor since I have another brush I've used as well, but just trying to keep track of all possibilities.\n\nAnyway, I'm just excited to finally have a CCS without much, if any, post shave irritation. Already looking forward to using the tech again.",

I planned on removing the wax of a new Wizamet this morning but I couldn't be bothered, so I used one of these Nacet that doesn't have wax. Good use for them for me lol =P\n\nThe Excelsior base to me is a nod back to White Label base, and a little of the Black Label vibe too. A harder base, takes a lot of water, and works well with hard water. Hell to the muthafuckin' yeah!!!\n\nI wanted to get back to the Rex because, well, I haven't used it a while. I was quickly reminded why it's a keeper, it's damn smooth!!! And if I want to turn it up or down, NO PROBLEM, just turn the dial. It's as easy as that.\n\nDFS for me, and Beaudelaire for me!!!\n\nHope everyone has a great day!\n",

I guess it's just not for me. And trying out the Special from Dr Jon's that arrived today.\n\n#### Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Charcoal Goods - Level 1 Brass ::: Astra - Platinum ‹11 uses›)*\n\nThis is a good razor, don't get me wrong. But it doesn't grip the blade, from the bottom, very close to the edge like some models. And that translates to some audio, as well as a shave that's not quite as smooth as some. So while this is nice, and certainly a piece of art, I think I just have others that will almost always be chosen ahead of it.\n\nBut had a good, close shave. No tugging or irritation.\n\n#### Soap Notes\n*^(Dr Jon's - Sunday Funday Extravaganza - Melange)*\n\nAnother of the Sunday Funday soaps from DJ. I think this one scores with me. Dry, I picked up more of the sweetness of apple and pineapple, with a touch of the smoky-woody. But in lather form, I get mostly the smoky-woody-and-something-else, that is also very lightly seasoned by the aforementioned fruit notes.\n\nA very intriguing and interesting scent that had me put on an unscented balm after, just so I could keep smelling it on me for a bit longer. And it's complex enough for me to think that I need a few shaves with it to really understand it. That I like.\n\n30 second load with lightly-wet brush + 3 tsp water = 4-5 passes of slick, creamy lather, delivering luxurious feel during the rinses.\n\nScent Strength: 6/10, wonderfully present during shaving. Some of DJ's recent SF soaps were too lightly scented for me. I'm glad this one ups the ante.\n\nBowl - I used the XL version of this bowl:\nhttps://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3392930\n\n\n#### Brush Notes\n*^(Stirling - Boar 24mm Factory Seconds ‹8 uses›)*\n\nWell, this little guy is slow to change, which may mean that when he gets to where I like him, he'll stay there for a very long time. Backbone still strong. For now, he's scrubby, but not yet comfortable.\n\nStill soaking for an hour or two before each use.\n\nJust on his 8th use, I think, so we just need to wait and be patient.\n\n#### Shave Quality\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Cut flush to where I just see the tips (above average for me)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm)\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

Way too thin. But tried the RFB and it was amazing!\n\n#### Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Gillette - NEW Raised Flat Bottom UK No. 77? ::: Gillette - Silver Blue ‹21 uses›)*\n\nWow, this razor gave me such a good shave! And maybe it was fortuitous that I would mess up the lather, because it made the razor shine even more. My first time with it today, and I can see why it is beloved.\n\nWith a 20-use blade, it sliced through my whiskers almost like butter, with barely any blade feel most of the time. This is a very smooth open comb.\n\nNot very much audio from the blade, just consistency.\nNo tugging or irritation.\n\n#### Soap Notes\n*^(Stirling - Stirling for Him)*\n\nMy lather sucked... but still did the job really well. It gave great glide to the razor and I was nicely protected. While it was thin, washed out, and never creamy, it still -- like a very good soap does -- worked.\n\n30 second load (plus another 10) with lightly-wet brush + 2.5 tsp water = 3 passes of thin, drippy lather.\n\nScent: a nice light cologne scent. I like it.\n\nScent Strength: 4/10, lightly present during shaving. This is a guess, because I was so focused on rescuing the lather that I didn't notice the scent.\n\nBowl - I used the XL version of this bowl:\nhttps://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3392930\n\n\n#### Brush Notes\n*^(Zenith - B10 Boar Red ‹8 uses›)*\n\nLove this guy. smooth on the face.

Three pass shave, as close to BBS as I get. I was going to use Fenchurch after much conversation on IRC earlier, but eyed up the Stirling that I haven't used in a while. Also, the lady is away and she does not like Vetiver, so Vetiver it will be.\n\nAfter having gotten my plumbing disaster taken care of, today seems easy in comparison. It's funny how easy it is to take for granted the ability to dump toilet, shower and faucets from inside your house. Have a great day everyone!",

Very nice soap that smells really good and performs very well. I'm glad I made the plunge to buy 3 tubs without sampling :)\n\nHaven't used my boar brush in a while and I regret leaving it in the cupboard for so long. This thing feels great on the skin. Only thing is that it takes a little more soap and time to get a good lather going. Got some great tips from /u/ET_Torment for lathering up better with the boar.\n\nPlate 4 on the Rockwell 6S worked out very well. Still did the 3 pass but no irritation and the neck and chin areas are smoother than I get with Plate 3.\n\nI'm very much enjoying changing up things on a daily basis. There's so much to learn.\n\nHave a great Wednesday!",

What I mean by this is to avoid those multiple strokes that I think many people do over the same area inside a single pass. Really tried, to the best of my ability, to never let the blade touch a spot that had already been touched before on that pass.\n\nIt was harder than I thought it would be! First of all it's so natural for me to do the multiple passes in one pass thing that this took a lot of concentration. Second, I found that doing this threw my technique off a bit because I was so focused on making it a true pass that other things were a bit off (this was particularly evident on my ATG pass).\n\nThat said, I was surprised that I got just as good and close a shave using this method as the multiple passes in one pass method. The small problems I did get seemed to be mostly linked to the fact that my technique was a little off.\n\nIt was a good experiment. I think this is something I will try to focus on going forward, although I need to be sure to remain focused on the other aspects of my technique as well.",

I couldn't handle another Piacenza shave. The floral/incense aroma followed me around all the way to lunch time and it didn't make me go \"mmm that's nice\" at any point. Even my shave brush annoyed me this morning because it still smelled like floral perfume. I guess I'm just not a \"floral fragrance\" person, based on my experiences with this soap and some colognes over the psat week... So I changed it up for today: Cella, because I have a doctor's appointment this morning and they don't take kindly to scented products in their office.\n\nAnother smooth 3-pass today with the Astra & Tech. Was very careful to only shave each patch once per stroke, as recently reminded in [the video Mantic59 posted this week](https://old.reddit.com/r/wicked_edge/comments/auo2bn/how_to_wet_shave_more_efficiently_but_still_enjoy/). The Astra felt plenty sharp enough to do its job today, with no more tugging on my chin whiskers than I would experience scritching them with my fingernails. Pretty pleased with these Astra blades so far.\n\nUsed Nivea balm today instead of Stirling. They both perform about the same for post-shave soothing properties, I think... the Stirling seems to have more face food listed in its ingrediments, but the Nivea feels lighter on my face. Leaves it feeling more bare and clean, and that's what I felt like today.",

What a difference. I had tried the last base a while back, and was very meh about it, and the scents quite honestly didn't thrill me, i'm a pretty simple guy early in the morning. I was placing an order recently and figured i'd give them another shot, now that they have a new base and some basic scents. Really glad I did. The scent is fine, basic sandalwood, but people sometimes try and get a little crazy trying to fancy it up. The soap itself is outstanding, no tallow/lanolin but just like Catie's Bubbles, you'd never know it.\n\nI have some more samples to get through but it looks like i'll be placing an order shortly. Plus, the proprietors are good people who hustle and that'll always get my dollar.",

It had been a couple of days since I had shaved because of some early mornings working at the gold tournament that Pepperdine was hosting. But back at it and it was great today. the Karve continues to be possibly the last razor I buy. I think that I would love to complete the set of all baseplates, but I will probably not get to that point. Definitely want to get one of the more aggressive SB plates, and a couple of the OC plates eventually though.\n\nHappy Shaves Y'all!",

Today was my first time shaving with it and I was expecting something else. The scent was described as a \"*inspired by a whiskey drink with chartreuse and orange bitters.\"* I get the angostura bitters, soured orange and herbaceous overtones of the chartreuse. What I am missing is the whiskey. I drink a fair amount of whisky and do occasional reviews on /r/Scotch, I know the various flavor and scent profiles of whiskey. I'm not finding those in \"Bon Vivant\". I don't think its a bad scent, its complex, spicy, bitter, earthy, herbaceous and a little fruity. It does *feel* boozy, but using the whiskey descriptor, I was hoping for some oak, vanilla, char, and corn or barley mash malt sweetness. I wont even talk about quality of the Deceleration soap. Lather was awesome as usual. Can anyone recommend some good whiskey or boozy soaps?\n\n​\n\nIn other news, spring is around the corner here in California and with that, my wife is getting ready to do a new season of plants and flowers. I took her to Home Depot yesterday and she picked out some annuals and perennials. I'll be doing the labor this weekend, planting and moving dirt. Its become almost a seasonal ritual. Between us, I actually hate gardening, but its a small sacrifice and I know she loves it so I pretend to be interested. I suspect she feels the same way about my shaving. I think that's important in a relationship, honoring each others interests even if you don't share them. Marriage is a marathon after all, not a sprint.\n\n​\n\nSpeaking of marathons, I am still training for my upcoming half-marathon in May. I had a spot of rain the last few days as well as some family visiting from out of town so I took some rest days, but I'm intending to get another run in today and tomorrow. Does anyone here run? I feel like I should train in the rain because I have no control of how the weather would be the day of the race, but I also don't feel like getting soaking wet for 4+ miles in 50 degree weather.\n\n​\n\nHave a great Wednesday.\n\nRobot\n\n\n\n​",

When I opened this Taiga, I noticed I hadn't rinsed off the old lather from the last use. So, I decided rather than waste a bunch just rinsing it off, I used it, then rinsed it after that. Sure a little still gets lost, but not as much. I'm sure the person I'm sending it to will appreciate not getting old lather as a sample rather than a soap lol =P (Believe, it seemed gross even to me, and it's my soap lol)\n\nToday I decided to compare what I thought was equivalent for me, the Nacet to Rapira Platinum Lux. I've made the comment that they shave the same for me, so I put them side by side.\n\nComing directly from a Nacet yesterday, I used a new Rapira Platinum Lux today. The first couple of strokes, it did feel a little rougher, but that quickly subsided to just about what the Nacet provided yesterday. Just a touch less smooth, but at the price difference, negligible for me (I won't be using either as a go to). They both produced an acceptable shave for me, and if I need more than that I have other blades I can use. The advantage here is, there aren't wax dots.\n\nAnyhow, after a full three pass shave, and some touch ups, I'm happy with my decision to use this full setup!\n\nDamn fine shave for me, I got to use a product I haven't used in a while, and someone gets a clean sample rather than scraped up old soap =P\n\nHappy hump day all!!!\n\nEdits: typo city",

WTG, XTG, XTG. I usually do a two pass with a clean up but I wanted to lather one more time with the new soap. Not a BBS but it'll do.\n\n**The Soap** was very nice. Despite being a mass-produced soap, it performed like an artisan soap. It was similar to the artisan soap shoppe soaps which I really enjoy. The scent is almond/nutty/roasty smell but it's almost unscented like. I realize that I like lighter scents so this is perfect for me. It performs amazing and has great slickness/protection. This is definitely a part of my soap rotation from now on.\n\n**The Razor and Blade** combination was decent. It worked but I did feel some tugginess throughout. Not the sharpest but it was somewhat smooth. Even after a three pass, I felt no irritation so that is success in my part. I'm going to give it one more go before stopping the Derby Extra experiment.\n\n**The Brush** is slowly becoming my lower tier synthetics. It's been couple months since I had it and it is a bit stiffer than the tuxedo knots. It's embedded a bit deeper so I understand but it is also pokey sometimes. I never used the Omega synthetics but I would say this brush would resemble those. It's also shedding everytime I use it so that is not good. It performs well but in terms of feel and shedding, it's not doing so hot. It also has some small holes in the middle of the knot, probably from the shedding hairs. I'll continue to use it anyway.\n\n**The aftershave portion** was nice. The TASS Humidor splash is strongly scented and I do not like that. It has a sweet tobacco/Barbershop smell with Cedar in the background. I Really did not like the strong scent in the beginning but after couple days, I'm getting used to it. Paired with the Nivea Balm, it's a pretty good combination of scent. Not bad.\n\nOverall, a decent shave. One more go with the razor/blade combo and I'm done. The soap performed very well. The brush is not doing so hot but I'm not giving it up. The aftershave scent was a bit too strong but I think I'll get used to it. Not bad at all.",

Still a good BBS and no lasting damage. The 100mm Torpedo is by far the most livable long handle I own, well balanced and many grip points.\n* Brush: The 26mm Elite bulb is really optimized for bowl lathering and even after a minute load shorted me on second pass lather. The knot is attractive and the handle even more so, which is why this stays in the rotation, but the load and lather efficiency is not there, at least not for face lathering.\n* Soap: Ring O Death showing up here, matching its FA brother. Scent still holds up well, 5 years in.\n* Frag: FI is sweeter, darker, and more resinous / vegetative than its FA colleague, used yesterday. Seems to be more subtle and lacks the top and midnote impact of its somewhat more exotic sibling. I prefer FA, but FI is certainly complex and well executed, and has a solid, understated grace that may appeal to those who are not fond of cardamom and / or thyme.",

Then I snapped out of it. That, and I just ran out time.\n\nInstead I'm shaving with my set of \"Philips Fougere\" that was gifted to me by /u/Ugmug during the shutdown. It is my favorite fougere scent and it feels clean, green and fresh, though today I wouldn't have minded if there was a little menthol in the AS, since I'm running on four hours of sleep and menthol gives me a nice little jolt in the morning.\n\nI'm going to wrap up this SOTD comment and get cup of coffee (or five).\n\nHave a great Thursday!\n",

I think it was bad water, because today's was excellent.\n\n#### Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Gillette - NEW Raised Flat Bottom UK No. 77? ::: PolSilver ‹13 uses›)*\n\nLove this razor, can mow down multiple days, but still be comfortable for a daily driver.\n\nNo tugging or irritation.\n\n#### Soap Notes\n*^(Stirling - Stirling for Him)*\n\nLather so good.\n\n1/4 tsp soap + with lightly-wet brush + 3.5 tsp water = 4 passes of scrumptious lather.\n\nScent: a nice light cologne scent. I like it.\n\nScent Strength: 3-4/10, lightly present during shaving.\n\nBowl - I used the XL version of this bowl:\nhttps://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3392930\n\n\n#### Brush Notes\n*^(Semogue - 1250 Boar ‹8 uses›)*\n\nWonderful feel on this one. Very comfortable. Backbone maybe 3-4/10.\n\n#### Shave Quality\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Smooth\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Cut flush to where I just see the tips (above average for me)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm)\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

I had the choice between a fresh 5-blade cart or this used 3-blade, but this was my tried and true, the one I'd settled on for many years as it was one of the more affordable cartridges. I remember waiting to pull the wetshaving trigger because this cart was relatively new, usually I used the same one for several months, but this one seemed in good shape. No solidified lather-stubble between the blades and the gel bank on the top had run dry (to my old and current preference). I gave it a quick dunk in the isopropyl just to be safe.\n\nThen came the barbasol, perhaps 3, 4 years old? At this point I wish I videoed myself the last time I did this routine, just so I'd remember how to apply it. With... with my hands? I sprayed some into my hand (after much vigorous shaking), it looked shiny, but didn't look how I remembered. It wasn't voluminous, and when I'd apply it on my face, it deflated into not much better than a puddle of lather. After I'd smeared it onto my face, it looked like a lather than would normally make me very nervous to shave, it was thin, didn't look protective, all signs pointing to irritation-city.\n\nThen the shave. It wasn't so hard, really, I pretty much did my old routine, or at least what I could remember. A single pass XTG on the face and jawline, and a single pass down my neck. I did 3 strokes on my right side of my face, and I thought it was not as terrible as I remembered. But then after that was complete, I'd have to go over the same area twice more. I'd forgotten about that. I didn't try any fancy ATG work because I still remember from middle school doing ATG above my lip and getting a dozen blood spots for the next few days. All in all it was a socially-acceptable shave. Not great, a little patchy, but acceptable.",

Between the two APR winter seasonals I have, I feel a stronger attachment to Fenchurch - it just fits the season and me better I guess. This one though, this one I appreciate more for the scent it is and wouldn't mind scoring some EdP if possible at some point. It's a unique mixture of smells that blend in the right way and at the right strength for me. Happy Friday Jr. and last day of February.",

HA HA - Lies. I got my tax return back and I decided to treat myself to Sakura Musk from Dr. Jon's SO GLAD I DID. It's a harder soap that you need to load heavy and then add water to get it to lather well. Longer to lather, but the results are fantastic. 4/5 shave smells great just a little lacking the post shave.\n\nCheers,",

It moves around really well and I feels like I've been using it my whole life.\n\nI've only recently allowed patchouli into my life and I'm glad I did. The Seville is very nice. It's bold and makes me feel rugged or something like that.\n\nMy life is so busy right now and the time spent working up a new soap and being mindful of what it offers is my only quiet time outside of trying to participate and learn from this sub and you guys. It makes me happy and I'm glad I have it.\n\nIt's Thursday already. Be good. Do good.",

I grabbed my wifes Target Smells Like Summertime and went hunting for my old Trac 2...I found 10 or 15 blades, but I couldn't for the life of me find the handle. I certainly wasn't using one of my wife's disposables. However, I did dig out a Merkur 37c slant that I had picked up but never used before, so I figured i'd give that a go, but without the Smells like Summertime.\n\nAnyway, slant was alright. Other than some mild irritation that is almost certainly my fault that went away in about 5 minutes, didn't really notice much of a difference either way other than I went much slower. I'll give it another whirl tomorrow, why not.",

This was easily the fastest shave I've had in years. Also, I went from 3 days growth to Socially Acceptable Shave in just one pass. And... nope, there's nothing else... that's all the good things I can say about this shave.\n\nOn the flip side, the goo did not smell good. It was difficult to get an even layer of shaving cream across my entire face because the goo was so \"thick and rich\" (clumpy and sticky). And oh dear Glob in heaven that razor dragged across my poor face. I was legit afraid to do a second pass in any direction for fear of creating an entire army of weepers. The goo had very little primary slickness and basically no residual slickness. And if post-shave feel weren't an imaginary metric, I'd say that the Barbasol left my face feeling dried out and uncomfortable.\n\nThank the Flying Spaghetti Monster that I had my bottle of Chatty Lux DdT toner close at hand to repair some of the damage. I don't imagine I'll be going back to cart and goo again (unless it's to try and pull off a spectacular win in the Lather Games).",

My wife immediately knew something was going on since I wasn't using my usual wet shaving gear and I quickly assured her it was only for last night.\n\nRazor Notes: I used to use a Gillette Sensor 2 as my primary travel razor which was good for a shave if needed in a pinch. I had 2 left over and knew I wanted to use one for last night's shave. The 2 blade cart was much worse than I remembered and I quickly switched to the Gillette Guard after a few mediocre passes at trying to shave my head. The Guard mowed through the remaining stubble without any issues and I also used it on my face. I'll continue to use the Guard on my head but it's back to DE for my face.\n\nLather Notes: I already had a can of Barbasol's 100th anniversary edition for decoration and collection purposes. It will remain that way for the foreseeable future after last night's shave. I had a small brain fart when I picked up the can because I couldn't remember if it needed to be shaken or not. The lather itself was very thick and dry too. I added a bit of water which made it better but I'd rather use something dirt cheap like Arko than use the canned foam stuff again.\n\nPost Shave Notes: Nivea Cooling post shave balm rounded out the cart and goo themed shave.\n\nEdit: Wow! Thank you very much u/BourbonInExile for the gold, very cool and unexpected.",

Honestly sort of forgot about it. Ordered in March 28 2016. So Almost three years lol. Not sure where to start with it. I set the razor to 4. I usually love aggressive razors. On 4 I felt a small amount of chatter. Not too terrible. I didn't try going higher, maybe tomorrow. I got the gunmetal coating which looks pretty good. Yeah it's heavy and the head is huge. Will give it a good couple of weeks use to see if I start enjoying it more.",

I keep this stuff around for getting the back of my neck, etc. I've had this razor handle since at least 2004... Pretty sure this is the first one I ever bought and I still have it.\n\nHere's my issue with carts and goo. The first shave with a fresh cart is great. But I know for a fact that if I use this cart again, it'll be tugging and irritation on my neck. One of the main reasons I keep it for body trimming and moved to the Norelco One Blade electric, and eventually wetshaving.\n\nEdit: The gold makes using edge gel worth it. Thanks!",

Unfortunately, things didn't go as smoothly as I would've liked. It was a fairly good shave all around except for a few areas where I got greedy. That was until I got to my neck. The blade seemed to have trouble cutting through my stubble WTG so I did 2 WTG passes as opposed to my normal 1. Then did my XTG north-south pass and was still left with quite a few long whiskers that I needed to clean up. The clean up chewed up the left side of my neck pretty bad; although surprisingly the right side was pretty good.\n\nI meant to moisturize post shower as well, but fell asleep first so my neck is more irritated than I would like today.\n\nI'm not sure how much the nicks/weepers were due to the blade or my lack of prep, but I'll need to start experimenting more. I'm glad I'm keeping notes on this stuff. It seems like a fresher blade definitely helps keep the irritation down on my neck. Anytime I've 3 shaves on a blade they are not great. Prep could also play a part though. I washed my face pre-shave with a high glycerin soap last time and failed to do that this time.\n\nEdit - Whisky was good as always. Laphroaig QC is one of my favorite scotches and I generally have a bottle on hand. Finally killed this ~2 year old bottle. The replacement is a bottle of Laphroaig Select which I don't like nearly as much. If I'm drinking peaty scotch, I tend to gravitate toward the harsher, younger varieties.",

Yesterday AM was a chilly one, so I got a heavier coat out, went outside, put the hood up... and POW! Got hit in the back of the head with today's tub of soap. It fell down somehow, got caught in the hood of my coat, and literally hit me in the head to request some attention.

That way if this turned into a total shit show, no real harm. As it happens I got a nice shave. I did about 2.5 passes and used a brush/bowl so I would have reserve lather to work with. The Nivea gel has a nice subtle cooling sensation and worked into a thicker lather than I expected (rather too thick, given the design of the razor and its tendency to clog easily). The balm is great--I've shifted to splashes so Nivea is the only balm I still own, but I really should use it more often.\n\nPros: Quick and efficient, easy on the face, no nicks.\nCons: 5 blades makes for awkward detail work vs. a single edge, and clogs easily\n\nVerdict: I'd be fine with using Harrys as a travel razor (when I don't want to check luggage), and I'll continue to use it on my...uhh....\"coin purse.\" Otherwise it's the DE life for me.",

NO WAY!!! HAH!!!\n\nIt's about time I got back to this razor. Such a smooth shaver for me. I'm not really into DC heads, but this is what I was able to get when I could, so this is what I have. I like both sides, they're definitely different. I'm not sure if I'd want OC or SB or both if I didn't have this one lol. The issue I have with DC is possibly that I can't use each side evenly, but why would I have to anyway, who knows. Either way, today I did the first 2 passes with the OC head (this one is good for evening the bottom edge of chops), and the third pass with the SB. The SB is milder for me than the OC...just a not for anyone considering a purchase.\n\nYou just cannot go wrong with Saponificio Varesino!!! Seems expensive, but don't be fooled. These pucks seem to last forever. This is v4.1, and a little harder than the newer 4.3, so probably lasts a little longer. My Stella Alpina in a Parkway tub is showing signs of R.O.D.S. (Ring of Death Syndrome), and I've had that for a much lesser time than Colonia. Oh well, I don't mind!!! This Colonianis showings signs of RODS as well, good...then I can move onto the v4.3 I have waiting here!!!\n=P\n\nAnyhow, DFS here today, mostly BBS, and a good deal of closeness in my problem areas.

Two pass, ATG, XTG. It felt wrong. The razor was dragging across the skin. Loads of stubbles left. At least it didn't irritate my skin.\n\n**The Soap** was okay. The Gillette goo smells clean and cologney and the performance is okay. It doesn't provide a lot of protection but it is slick enough. One thing is that it sticks to the razor and the blades so it is very tough to clean them out after each pass. Average Goo.\n\n**The Razor and Blade** combination was a yikes. It felt like 3 Derby blades dragging across my skin. I couldn't get a good pass unless I put more pressure into the razor and I am not doing that. Definitely a no for me.\n\n**The Brush** :(\n\n**The aftershave portion** was the only thing that was nice about the shave. It felt nice after but when I look at my face, there is barely any hair reduced... I'm not even sure if I shaved or not.\n\nOverall, a disappointing shave. Razor dragged and the soap performed average. I probably won't be doing this again unless another Theme pops up. But still, just do yourself a favor and wet shave.",
