Field Day for the next 31 shaves. This brush, this razor, this very same blade. For the next 31 shaves. This is going to be a challenge but I very much look forward to it.\n\nAnd but so the main goal for me here is to learn how to use this brush, which was gifted to me by my still-Secret Santa in the Christmas in July gift exchange. This is the first badger brush I've owned and I loved it as soon as I took it out of the box. Seriously, if my Secret Santa is reading this, don't think I'm above bribing /u/Nex_Renegade with things from his wish list in order to get your username for a shoutout. I am not.\n\nThe shave this morning was nothing less than amazing. I was really surprised at how easy it was to get a *ton* of lather out of this brush. I was expecting a little more difficulty but I loaded just as much as do my synthetics, which is all I've ever used. In fact, I think I got more lather out of it than my synths. I did notice that it took a bit more water but not that much more. I didn't even do any practice lathers with this brush. The only prep I did was soak it in some soapy water for a few hours after I unboxed it.\n\nThe other thing I changed up this morning, at the advice of /u/sgrdddy, was that I used cold water throughout the whole shave. Usually, I save the cold water rinse as the last rinse I do before applying aftershave but I did cold water the entire way around and loved it. There was almost no irritation. Almost. But I think the slightest irritation was due to the first time on this blade. Kinda nervous about trying to take it to 31 shaves, as the most I've ever done previously on *any* DE blade was 10. But this is a goddamn learning experience, right?\n\nVery excited to see this whole austerity thing through and to read about everyone's experience.\n\nI feel like a monk or something. Day 1, in the books.",

This scent is their take on the scent of an Italian cookie. The scent for me was very light, almost to the point that I couldn't smell it. I was disappointed by that. Performance was still excellent but not as slick to me as the other three varieties I used. Probably not a full tub purchase for me, but still a very nice soap. I'm glad to have tried AYLM soaps.",

I damn near went with Otter tea but then I thought hmmmm that'd be a better scent once the weather turns cooler.\n\nI'm also slightly OCD about scuffing up my soap lids (usually occurs during travel) and since we'll have a trip to the hospital any day now I wanted to take something that won't bug me as much of the label gets all shoddy. Resolute is also a killer scent that's versatile enough for home or work. My wife digs the cologne scents too, so if I'm going to use one thing all month I think she'll appreciate this one.\n\nThe Dogwood brush is probably my favorite brush. Dat B5 is the best badger hair I've come across. Lava Flow handle is straight fire too.\n\nThe Perma-Sharps, which previous versions were labeled Perma Sharp Supers I believe, are from a fresh 100 pack of Amazon. It's mildly interesting that they are now labeled as \"Gillette Perma-Sharp.\"\n\nThe Fatboy was another difficult decision. I was so tempted to go with a Bulldog this month. Then I thought about a #19. Then I was like \"ooh a thin handle rfb new.\" But given the situation, I think the adjustable is the way to go. I don't normally shave every day, so being able to turn this thing down a couple notches will be welcomed. This is also the razor I pieced together from a combination of fatboy and executive parts. I don't think I'll run into any problems but it'll be interesting to give it an extended test run to make sure I tuned it correctly.",

Elliot 6/8 wedge\n**Post:** Lucky Tiger - Oil of Olay Complete\n\nI used a badger for my fourth shave with this cream. It went much better than with my boar. I have one more shave left with the sample and I will go back to the synthetic brush since that is what produced the best results. It has been interesting using this cream. It produces a low volume lather that is very slick and effective. The stand out quality has been the post shave feel which is what it was developed for. I have to say that in that respect it's a bullseye. I can see where repeated daily use of this would be very beneficial with a possible cumulative effect. That is a bold statement after only four shaves, but with each shave the post shave feel seems to have lingered a little longer into the day than the previous day.\n\nOff to another day of fun and frolic.",

BBS-1\n\n**Blade:** $0.80 Kai\n\n**Soap:** $31 CL x DG Santal Auster\n\n**Post:** $30 CL Santal Auster Toner\n\n**Frag:** $90 CL Santal Auster Extrait\n\n***\n[Last year's Austere August](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/6quu79/tuesday_sotd_thread_aug_01_2017/dl0b8ob/) I took (arguably) more literally and, with the exception of the new Semogue Brushbutt that needed broken in, I went about as cheap as I could because, you know, austerity. The entire set up cost me $56.49, consisted of a nice boar brush, a cheap Baili, Clubman, and Arko, and should get you through your first year of wet shaving for around $60.\nThis year I'm also on theme, but in a slightly different way. First of all, my software is Santal Auster - not only is austere literally in the name, but it's *so* austere that it doesn't even bother with the second 'e' - and its note list is one word. Beyond that the hardware itself is about as austere as it gets in name. The brush is from batch one. Not 2, not 3 (never go 3), not 4, not 5, etc. The razor is a BBS-1 (again, 1 - not 2, 3, etc) and contains a full 3 letters.\n\nFinally, and this may be true or just the cynical side of me coming out, but in any good austerity measures, someone is gonna come out ahead right? This year, I figured, why not me. So I'm going to enjoy this month being the absolute fattest cat I can be, shaving with the most expensive objects (original retail and/or \"market value\") that I own (or borrowed...**HUGE GINORMOUS THANKS TO /u/onabluecloud for letting me borrow his treasured BBS-1 for an entire month**).\n\nBy my count, I \"improved\" on last year's setup by about tenfold, getting to an original retail price of **$601.80**. Of course, that's assuming either possession of a time machine or placing no value on time (since we all know that it is in fact money, even if I haven't yet found any place that will allow me to swap that for goods). If we get into that shady, nasty, full of crooks and thieves secondary market of wet shaving wares, then this set up could easily encroach upon 2 Gs (or 3 if you end up dropping 1200 on a BBS-1 raffle and taking an L).",

I've been waiting for four years to be eligible for this selection.\n\nI failed.\n\nI can't explain why I failed. I've been preparing for months and even nailed a full-boat practice test with the Cadre, on the course and equipment, this passed Friday. Straight up, I just... choked.

The gamut.\n\nMy reward for failure is two years of time to think about how I didn't get it done and prepare better for the next selection process. Which is two years from now.

My Reserve Seville order will be here today or tomorrow and I just got a half dozen new samples that I am dying to try. But I am going to try. I decided to go with a couple of favorites. I have been using the Barrbarr a lot anyway so I can try to kill it and buy a new tub of the new formula. I am also going with the Reserve Cool since it is my favorite aftershave. For a razor, I am going with the FaTip Grande. I have had this for several months and only used it a handful of times, so I figured this would be as good a time as any to get to know the razor. I am a little worried about that since it is the only open comb I've ever used and it may be a little harsh. But this morning went well with a simple two pass shave (covering the ground that I normally get for a three pass, if I want to be honest). The real challenge is when that Seville comes in. Can I resist the temptation?\n\n[Happy August ](https://imgur.com/gallery/i9wLoYl)",

In the interest of learning as much as I can, I'm going full Ultra Nightmare. Because YOLO or You Only Have One Face or whatever.\n\n* **Pre:** Iced latte, hot shower, Harry's face wash, Stirling mentholated soap\n* **Razor:** Merkur Futur\n* **Blade:** Astra SP (1)\n* **Brush:** Merkur Futur brush\n* **Lather:** Noble Otter Lonestar (sample)\n* **Post:** alum, no aftershave\n\nI decided to commit to Lonestar because I've consistently lathered NO pretty badly, so the month of practice will be great. And Lonestar smells exactly like a wonderful summer day to me, so it seems like a good scent to use for a whole month of summer.\n\nUnfortunately, August arrived faster than the package from NO with the full jar and aftershave, so I guess I'll do without an AS until Friday.\n\nThis was also my first time using the Futur set that I snagged from WCS's summer sale. All in all, a pretty good shave today for a new razor, a new brush, a soap that I'm bad at, and no aftershave.\n\nA promising start to August!",

So, first with the blade. I've never used a Gillette Platinum before and it was a bit tuggy, but I'm gonna remain hopeful that it'll smooth out as time goes on. The soap itself is fantastic, as I knew it would be. The Nekromantik aftershave was different than I expected. The scents weren't carbon copies like they are for some artisans, but I like this approach much better. It's the same basic scent but the notes that pop out are a bit brighter and not as dusty. It's really rather nice to be surprised like that. As for the EdP, Nekromantik is SUCH a great fuckin scent that I've stared at the as-of-yet-unreleased EdP in my cabinet longingly every single day since it arrived, but I wanted to wait until today to try it out. Totally worth the wait. Seriously. I'm curious to see just how long the scent lingers.",

It still shaves well, though it's not a laser anymore. I did a once-over followed by XTG and ATG on the spots that could use it and was pleased with the closeness. Time from when I started getting stuff out of the cabinet to when I was done putting things back in the cabinet was 21 minutes.\n\nThe CL1 is scrubby as all get out, doesn't shed and makes great lather quickly, but it has some scritch when making circular motions on more sensitive areas and the handle is kind of small for my hands. It absolutely tears into the hard puck of homemade soap. It also is just the right size to soak in my old Old Spice mug while I'm getting the rest of my gear out of the cabinet.",

I don't dislike either, really, but I'm definitely trying to get rid of the Proraso and I figured this would be a good time to do it. The lather itself is not bad, although it is not particularly slick. I don't like the scent, though, and I really don't like menthol, so I may just toss whatever's left over at the end of the month. I need to take a before and after pic of the tube to show it diminishing (if I can get around to it).\n\nI don't think I'll use the blade all month. I won't ditch it until it's bad, but I've only ever been able to stretch a blade to 20 shaves before, so I won't worry too much about doing it for this month.\n\nHappy Austere August to all!",

But since Hallows preorder opened today, I wanted to try it out and see if it was something I might care to order. When smelling the sample container, I could clearly pick up the cocoa and cedar. It had kind of a \"drinking your hot chocolate in grandpa's study because that's the best place to watch the nasty weather\" kind of vibe. When I lathered it up, the dirty dirty vetiver jumped to the fore and it flipped to a \"standing outside in the nasty weather watching that kid drink hot chocolate in his grandpa's study\" kind of vibe.\n\nI liked it, but I don't think I liked it enough to jump on the pre-order train. Also, maybe I can honor the spirit of Austere August by limiting my purchases this month, even if I can't manage to shave with the same setup all month.",

      "body": "This has become my absolute favorite shave of the summer and I thought I'd pass the formula on. I'm definitely a frag head who focuses quite a bit on the scents of my shaving products. This shave takes advantage of a great pairing of fragrances: DR Harris Arlington and Creed Silver Mountain Water (Stirling Mountain Man is a clone of this Creed fragrance).\n\n* **Lather:** Super lather made from DR Harris Arlington and Stirling Mountain Man\n* **Brush:** Plissoft Silvertip\n* **Razor:** Feather AS-D2 (with Feather blade of course)\n* **Post:** Stirling Mountain Man AS, Arlington AS Milk\n* **Scent:** Creed Silver Mountain Water, DR Harris Arlington\n\nIf you've ever tried SMW, you know that the opening notes are a bit confusing (many people describe the opening as \"inky\"). The top notes for this scent are supposed to be citrus, but they just don't quite come though. After about 30 minutes, the white tea note begins to come out and this scent really shines for the next 4-6 hours.\n\nArlington has a bright citrus opening that is immediately obvious. After 30-60 minutes, this fades to a weak fern scent (probably a skin scent unless you douse yourself) in a fairly linear fashion.\n\nThe combination of these two scents is absolutely magical as they perfectly compliment one another. Arlington dominates the top notes where SMW is weak. The Creed SMW takes over during the dry down, yet somehow the fern from the Arlington scent makes the tea note from SMW feel a bit more natural.\n\nThe super lather made from DR Harris cream and a Stirling soap is really as good a shave as I've ever had. These are both really nice soaps that I find to be really complimentary in terms of shaving properties. DR Harris creams have really top notch slickness and lather stability. Stirling soaps are consistently excellent for cushion. I face lather with this combination and four passes leaves me with an absolutely irritation-free BBS shave.\n\nThe only truly pricey component to this shave is the Creed fragrance. However, you can find a (relatively) cheap split here:\n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/fragsplits/comments/8kezzh/uscan_creed_silver_mountain_water_2014_batch_14m01/",

Immediately her first choice was \"Aventus!\" but I'm running on a sample of Executive Man from Stirling that might not have made it through the month. I set aside all of the soaps that I have matching sets for and she picked Seville. So here I am.\n\nWent for the pre-war Tech and a Perma-Sharp because that's probably my favorite combo atm. Usually I can get 4-5 shaves out of a blade before it starts to get a little tuggy, and I've never tried to go past that. I'm going to try for the Ultra-Nightmare mode, but if my face starts regretting this decision I'll just change the blade and bump down to the next difficulty. I suppose I could have made this a little easier with a GEM-style SE, but whatever. Let's see if Perma-Sharp's name is deserved or false-advertising...",

Using Semogue 620 Premium Boar 21mm until 8/8 and then switching. Will use between 25-30 swirls each day and then weigh again on 8/8 before starting with a new brush, and so on.

Field Day for the next 31 shaves. This brush, this razor, this very same blade. For the next 31 shaves. This is going to be a challenge but I very much look forward to it.\n\nAnd but so the main goal for me here is to learn how to use this brush, which was gifted to me by my still-Secret Santa in the Christmas in July gift exchange. This is the first badger brush I've owned and I loved it as soon as I took it out of the box. Seriously, if my Secret Santa is reading this, don't think I'm above bribing /u/Nex_Renegade with things from his wish list in order to get your username for a shoutout. I am not.\n\nThe shave this morning was nothing less than amazing. I was really surprised at how easy it was to get a *ton* of lather out of this brush. I was expecting a little more difficulty but I loaded just as much as do my synthetics, which is all I've ever used. In fact, I think I got more lather out of it than my synths. I did notice that it took a bit more water but not that much more. I didn't even do any practice lathers with this brush. The only prep I did was soak it in some soapy water for a few hours after I unboxed it.\n\nThe other thing I changed up this morning, at the advice of /u/sgrdddy, was that I used cold water throughout the whole shave. Usually, I save the cold water rinse as the last rinse I do before applying aftershave but I did cold water the entire way around and loved it. There was almost no irritation. Almost. But I think the slightest irritation was due to the first time on this blade. Kinda nervous about trying to take it to 31 shaves, as the most I've ever done previously on *any* DE blade was 10. But this is a goddamn learning experience, right?\n\nVery excited to see this whole austerity thing through and to read about everyone's experience.\n\nI feel like a monk or something. Day 1, in the books.",

I've done a lot of ruminating, and had a few discussions with friends these past few months, which got me thinking back to when I got started in this game. Because of all this, I thought I might spend this month writing about where I started, where I am now, and how I got from there to here. Perhaps even a bit about what's to come. Who knows, given how much I tend to ramble.\n\nMy setup for the month is rooted in my original wetshaving set up, which I used (mostly) exclusively for 12-ish years. The hardware is different, but the software is that setup from way back when. I'll get into why chose this specific gear set as the month progresses. For now, I'll just say that WMS is exactly how I remember it XD\n\nWhat better way to start this event than with my favorite Stones record? Maybe I'll make this month an all-Stones month as well. Probably should have started at the beginning if I were going to do that. We'll see.\n\nHappy Wednesday, all. Good luck to my fellow Augusterity participants!\n\n--\nPrevious | Next\n:-|-:\n|[Chapter 1: Origins](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/93xfc5/thursday_austere_august_sotd_thread_aug_02_2018/e3hvwso/)",

I set aside all of the soaps that I have matching sets for and she picked Seville. So here I am.\n\nWent for the pre-war Tech and a Perma-Sharp because that's probably my favorite combo atm. Usually I can get 4-5 shaves out of a blade before it starts to get a little tuggy, and I've never tried to go past that. I'm going to try for the Ultra-Nightmare mode, but if my face starts regretting this decision I'll just change the blade and bump down to the next difficulty. I suppose I could have made this a little easier with a GEM-style SE, but whatever. Let's see if Perma-Sharp's name is deserved or false-advertising...",

Longtime listener, first-time caller.\n\nI recently shaved off the beard I've been sporting for three-ish years, and I've been lurking here and correcting my misconceptions about how much shaving gear I should have...\n\nI was drawn in by Austere August. In the interest of learning as much as I can, I'm going full Ultra Nightmare. Because YOLO or You Only Have One Face or whatever.\n\n* **Pre:** Iced latte, hot shower, Harry's face wash, Stirling mentholated soap\n* **Razor:** Merkur Futur\n* **Blade:** Astra SP (1)\n* **Brush:** Merkur Futur brush\n* **Lather:** Noble Otter Lonestar (sample)\n* **Post:** alum, no aftershave\n\nI decided to commit to Lonestar because I've consistently lathered NO pretty badly, so the month of practice will be great. And Lonestar smells exactly like a wonderful summer day to me, so it seems like a good scent to use for a whole month of summer.\n\nUnfortunately, August arrived faster than the package from NO with the full jar and aftershave, so I guess I'll do without an AS until Friday.\n\nThis was also my first time using the Futur set that I snagged from WCS's summer sale. All in all, a pretty good shave today for a new razor, a new brush, a soap that I'm bad at, and no aftershave.\n\nA promising start to August!",

I damn near went with Otter tea but then I thought hmmmm that'd be a better scent once the weather turns cooler.\n\nI'm also slightly OCD about scuffing up my soap lids (usually occurs during travel) and since we'll have a trip to the hospital any day now I wanted to take something that won't bug me as much of the label gets all shoddy. Resolute is also a killer scent that's versatile enough for home or work. My wife digs the cologne scents too, so if I'm going to use one thing all month I think she'll appreciate this one.\n\nThe Dogwood brush is probably my favorite brush. Dat B5 is the best badger hair I've come across. Lava Flow handle is straight fire too.\n\nThe Perma-Sharps, which previous versions were labeled Perma Sharp Supers I believe, are from a fresh 100 pack of Amazon. It's mildly interesting that they are now labeled as \"Gillette Perma-Sharp.\"\n\nThe Fatboy was another difficult decision. I was so tempted to go with a Bulldog this month. Then I thought about a #19. Then I was like \"ooh a thin handle rfb new.\" But given the situation, I think the adjustable is the way to go. I don't normally shave every day, so being able to turn this thing down a couple notches will be welcomed. This is also the razor I pieced together from a combination of fatboy and executive parts. I don't think I'll run into any problems but it'll be interesting to give it an extended test run to make sure I tuned it correctly.",

BBS in 4 passes and no irritation or nicks. I can't believe how my technique has improved since I first started wet shaving a couple years ago. Another great shave!",

Two reasons really. 1) I want to see how dry I can get my face obviously, and 2) I want to see how cheaply I can shave for a month. So I've weighed the Arko before my first shave and I'll measure it at the end of the month, then try to figure out my cost, or at least how much I used per shave. It is currently 409 grams in an Old Spice mug. I'll probably only be shaving 15-16 times this month, but who knows? Semogue is to finally break in the little bastard.

The same friend sent me a sample of Diamond and I like it more. Soon after I received that sample I scored a barely used jar of Diamond for a good price and it arrives this weekend.\n\nThe perma-sharp/Gillette Tech combo is killer. I never achieve bbs without severe irritation. Several hours after this shave, I realized that I'd in fact achieved it by happy accident with no irritation. I'm astounded to say the least. Perfect combo and I recommend people with sensitive skin to try that out!",

So, first with the blade. I've never used a Gillette Platinum before and it was a bit tuggy, but I'm gonna remain hopeful that it'll smooth out as time goes on. The soap itself is fantastic, as I knew it would be. The Nekromantik aftershave was different than I expected. The scents weren't carbon copies like they are for some artisans, but I like this approach much better. It's the same basic scent but the notes that pop out are a bit brighter and not as dusty. It's really rather nice to be surprised like that. As for the EdP, Nekromantik is SUCH a great fuckin scent that I've stared at the as-of-yet-unreleased EdP in my cabinet longingly every single day since it arrived, but I wanted to wait until today to try it out. Totally worth the wait. Seriously. I'm curious to see just how long the scent lingers.\n\nALMOST missed posting this here too. Whew!",

Hard to explain but it seems to have the rigidity of a GEM razor plus a little extra something; it just needs to be a little bit gentler. I'm hoping that it settles down a little bit but I'm sure I'll get through. If anyone goes too wrong with it I guess I can always nope out of Ultra Nightmare mode and drop down a level. I can already tell I'm going to get so tired of wearing the extrait everyday, but I have no worries at this point about the shaving part. It's not exciting to be honest, but I'm thinking that might make it a little easier to get through. There's a beautiful complex simplicity to this little one note scent.",

The entire set up cost me $56.49, consisted of a nice boar brush, a cheap Baili, Clubman, and Arko, and should get you through your first year of wet shaving for around $60.\nThis year I'm also on theme, but in a slightly different way. First of all, my software is Santal Auster - not only is austere literally in the name, but it's *so* austere that it doesn't even bother with the second 'e' - and its note list is one word. Beyond that the hardware itself is about as austere as it gets in name. The brush is from batch one. Not 2, not 3 (never go 3), not 4, not 5, etc. The razor is a BBS-1 (again, 1 - not 2, 3, etc) and contains a full 3 letters.\n\nFinally, and this may be true or just the cynical side of me coming out, but in any good austerity measures, someone is gonna come out ahead right? This year, I figured, why not me. So I'm going to enjoy this month being the absolute fattest cat I can be, shaving with the most expensive objects (original retail and/or \"market value\") that I own (or borrowed...**HUGE GINORMOUS THANKS TO /u/onabluecloud for letting me borrow his treasured BBS-1 for an entire month**).\n\nBy my count, I \"improved\" on last year's setup by about tenfold, getting to an original retail price of **$601.80**. Of course, that's assuming either possession of a time machine or placing no value on time (since we all know that it is in fact money, even if I haven't yet found any place that will allow me to swap that for goods). If we get into that shady, nasty, full of crooks and thieves secondary market of wet shaving wares, then this set up could easily encroach upon 2 Gs (or 3 if you end up dropping 1200 on a BBS-1 raffle and taking an L).",

      "body": "Semi - Austere August Day # 2\n\nLike the US and greenhouse gas regulation, I am only mildly committed to this goal and so will comply only a teeny bit with the overall concept.\n\nSo in August, I will use:\n\nOne blade type (Bolzano) One razor brand (ATT - three models) One soap brand (Eufros - 8 scents) One brush brand (Elite - three models) One post shave brand (B&M Reserve, 5 scents)\n\nSo, today's shave:\n\n* Soap: Eufros Tobacco\n* Brush: Elite 28mm amboyna burl handle with fan Manchurian knot\n* Razor: ATT Atlas S1\n* Blade: Bolzano (1)\n* Post: B&M Reserve Fern Splash\n* Frag: CL Lamplight Penance sample\n\n* Product Notes:\n\n* Soap: Least impressive of the Eufros line to me, a gentle, mellow tobacco note that does not sting me (like other more potent \"tobaccos\" e.g. MLS Havana Royale, CB Connecticut Shade) but also lacks the interest and punch of those other takes. Shave was perfect, clean and comfy, and there's something to be said for mild, relaxing scents -- on occasion. Glad I am not shaving all of August with this scent!\n\n* Razor: S1 seems less aggressive even with the heavier Atlas handle after using the aluminium Calypso for 10 days or so. Still a great shave, but the added (mild) hand fatigue from pushing the extra 50 grams around my face for 20 minutes was noticeable.\n\n* Frag: Interesting scent, very oily. As is always the case with those little dabber things they put in samples of perfume, I think I over-applied. Beware fellow Culver Line commuters! Definitely a Fall / Winter scent.",

I find it's somewhere between T+S, which leaves me feeling like I've just replaced my face with a much newer, healthier one, and B&M Glissant, which leaves me feeling a bit dry at first but then gets much better throughout the day. With the NO soap, I don't feel like I have a new, better face, but I also don't feel much like I've just sliced off a layer of skin.",

      "body": "# SOTD: 02 August 2018\n\n### Augusterity: Day 02 (MTNG's Ultra-Nightmare Mode)\n\n***Pre-Shave:*** *Hot water splashes, proto-lather.*\n\n***Lather:*** *Williams Mug Shaving Soap.*\n\n***Brush:*** *Declaration Grooming Custom w/B5 Knoot.*\n\n***Razor:*** *Baili* BR-171 *w/Gillette 7 O'Clock Super Platinum blade (2).*\n\n***Post-Shave:*** *Extra lather, cold water splashes, Nivea Men* Sensitive *Post Shave Balm.*\n\n***Soundtrack:*** Aftermath *by The Rolling Stones.*\n\n##### Chapter 1: Origins.\n\nPicture it: Western Pennsylvania. 2003. Springtime. I was in the middle of what would become my final tour of college (ugh), and broke af. I'd grown a beard the previous winter.\n\nThe reason that I'd grown the beard was because I was broke af and couldn't afford to buy carts at the time for my Mach 3.\n\nHowever, by the time that spring rolled around, I'd also grown tired of the beard. I wanted it gone because it was itchy and annoying (I didn't know how to take care of a beard in those days), and the weather was getting warmer. I couldn't see shelling out for another pack of carts because they'd always given me sticker shock, even when I had money. And in those years I had no money.\n\nSo I thought it would be cool to buy a straight razor both because my vision of them was old timey and awesome, and because I figured I could find one for like $5 because who the fuck was buying straight razors in the 21st century?\n\nTurns out, probably not very many people at all, but after some research I found that they were still being manufactured though nearly impossible to find online. Besides, no way I had the scratch to procure one, let alone a strop along with it. However, during that research I also found out that those old timey single blade razors that I'd seen in period films still existed, and they weren't ridiculously expensive. I thought maybe one of those would be worth checking out.\n\nWhile this was going on, I saw some blades for those razors at my local pharmacy, and those were only like $1 for a 5 pack. I figured that was a much better deal than $20 or whatever it was for a 4 pack of Mach 3 carts. While looking at those, I also noticed these packages of soap that were also only $1 each. Williams Mug Shaving Soap. \"For a lasting lather,\" it said on the box. I thought, *Wow! They still make that soap that you use a brush to lather! I gotta check this out. It's like 1/4 of the price of those cans of gel!*\n\nSo, I needed to buy one of those brushes, too. I saved up some money while doing some more research and eventually found a web shop that sold these crazy razors. I plunked down the cash for a Merkur 34C. It looked the closest to my vision of an old timey razor. I found a badger brush made by Edwin Jagger at a Caswell-Massey store that I'd happened into, which looked to be about in the mid-range of their line of brushes. I bought that as well.\n\nThose two purchases were quite precious. I was banking on them being BIFL items though I didn't know that that term existed at the time. Looking back, the razor really wasn't that much more than a pack of carts would have cost (I think it was like $35 or something).\n\nEquipment procured, I was ready to shave like back in the olden times. I figured the shaves would suck, since the razor only had one blade instead of 3, but I accepted that since it was what I could afford. Plus, I felt that it would be fun and different to do my own thing rather than using the same shit that everyone else did. Little did I know...\n\n-----\nPrevious | Next\n:-|-:\n[Preface](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/93qcgg/wednesday_sotd_thread_aug_01_2018/e3fgq0z/)|[Chapter 2: That Fateful Day](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/947s2a/friday_austere_august_sotd_thread_aug_03_2018/e3jcmx7/)",

I suppose I should put that in quotes. \"Relationship.\" And since we've all gotten together recently and talked about it and agreed that we were going to be all open and vulnerable and shit, as men ought to be able to be, I suppose that I will take the conch and go next, as it were.\n\nIt's not like it was a long time. A little over four months is not that long of a time. But yikes guys, I kinda fell for this one kinda hard and do you want to know what else? I fell three times because she has kids! And mind you, this is not the first time I've dated a woman with children. I'm 30 years old. It's pretty much inescapable at this point but I'm really okay with that. I like kids. I want some, someday. And her kids are great. Two girls, nine and five. Spittin' image. And given circumstances and mathematics and shit, odds are that I probably won't ever have kids of mine own. And I'm okay with that too, after being around those girls. It made me realize that I could be totally, completely fulfilled being a stepparent. I could love as if they were my blood. I don't question that anymore. I suppose that I choose to take that away from this relationship. If nothing else, that.\n\n*(There once was this one time where the three of us were sitting at the kitchen table at her place and she was in the kitchen and we had just gotten back from going out to lunch at some really mediocre Mexican place and the little one, Addie, started having a meltdown so we had to skedaddle and but so we got back and got her calmed down and the sun was coming through the windows, you could see the dust motes and everything felt really good, it felt warm and Addie was playing with some toy what was it god I hate that I can't remember what it was and she was asking her mom if she could have three more of them, whatever they was, and she said these words she said \"and then the whole family could have one\" and I swear she looked at me and she quickly corrected herself, this five year old did that, and I don't think her mom heard the error because she didn't react but I did, Addie, I heard you and at that moment, little one, I felt ten feet tall and positively electric. I wanted that too.)*\n\nI got sober from drugs and alcohol almost five years ago. It will be five years at the end of September. I even got a tattoo for it and I do mean *for it.* I got it the morning I got sober. And I got that tattoo shortly after my last relationship ended, partly (okay fine mostly) due to my near-constant drinking. When you're 25 and have developed such a habit that you find yourself in your underwear drinking whiskey at 7am to kill the monstrous, black hangover from last night, it's grindingly, creakingly, crashingly clear that something has gone severely wrong somewhere. Something, maybe perhaps even *several* things have become fucked up. And in an effort to unfuck them, I got a tattoo and started going to AA after we broke up and I started going to /r/StopDrinking and I credit that subreddit, even moreso than AA, with helping save my life. But that's another Deep and Meaningful post for another deep and meaningful SOTD. *You're about to have a breakup, stick to the script, asshole.*\n\nI do feel better already. I just wanted this one to work out and it was really close this time, I think, guys. It just wasn't quite the best fit. But I do feel oddly motivated in a way. I know that I did some things right and I did some things wrong and it was a valuable learning experience and in a break from the past, I don't even really blame myself for this breakup. At the *very least,* I can say that I wasn't a drunken, sloppy goddamn mess for the entirety of the relationship. So I guess you could say that I'm trending fucking upwards at this point in time. I have some good shit to offer, goddamit. I get that now. For the very first time, I sincerely feel like this is her loss. I'm not beating myself up over this. It feels good to be able to say that. That is fucking progress and I like that shit. I want more of that. I cannot allow myself to get all mopey and down about this because I just do not have time for that shit.\n\nYeah. I do feel better. At least I look good and smell good, right?\n\nHappy Friday!",

I felt like since I have a whopping 3 Seville reserve soaps and 5 aftershaves I should probably try to kill off my glissant and tonique. So naturally I picked my gluttonous 27mm B4 DG knot so I could waste even more soap. We'll see if I can break a hole in this thing by the end of the month.",

This blade still feels like a bad fit for this razor. Even an hour post shave, my face feels somewhat scraped raw. I know it's not the software because it simply doesn't get any better than Icarus and CL toner, and there's a pretty harsh blade feel during the shaves. At this point I'm still hoping this blade calms down some, but at the least I'll have to sneak in a few shaves in September with other blades to see how it handles them.",

This is officially the most days in a row I've used the same soaps in almost a year. I'm honestly getting an even better understanding of lathering up SW. I got a better cushion today with it than I have any other time I've tried it. Also, definitely didn't experience as much tugging from the blade as I have been. Now, whether that's because the blade just needed using a bit first or if it's from maybe adjusting my technique as u/airbornesimian suggested, I'm not fully sure. Maybe a combination of both. Either way, so far so good.",

It is just a little to aggressive for me. So I'll probably give it a few more shaves to see if I adjust and then bail on it. I'm also unsure if I can stick to a soap for a month, but if I could stick to one it will be this one. There are other things I like as well, but nothing I like better.",

I'd bought a pack of unbranded blades from my local pharmacy, but when I ordered the razor, the shop also offered sample packs of blades, so I bought one of those as well. It had 5 tucks of blades in it: Derby, Feather, Merkur, Personna, and Wilkinson Sword. I wasn't sure which to try first. Then I thought, *I'm starting from zero with this thing regardless,* so I did the most democratic thing I could think of: I tossed the lot into the air and chose which one landed closest to my feet. It ended up being the Personna, so that's what I loaded up. That method of blade choice has stuck with me for the past 15 years, by the way.\n\nAgain, I don't exactly remember the shave itself in great detail. I lathered the soap, though I'm sure my lather was more like soap suds than proper lather. I shaved. I nicked myself a few times. I'd bought a styptic pencil at the pharmacy with the no-name blades and the Williams, so I used that. It was exhilarating. I still had most of a bottle of Nivea Sensitive balm left over from when I'd been using cartridge razors (it had basically been my go-to aftershave), so I used that, which was nice and soothing. I probably rashed myself a bit, too, but I don't remember. I know that I gave myself burn on several occasions in those early days as I adjusted my technique and acclimated to using a razor with more blade feel than those carts.\n\nAll in all, though, it was a fairly uneventful shave. Cuts? Yeah, BFD. Razor burn? Probably but it goes away. The thing that I do remember was being surprised by how little effort was involved in using it, and how close a shave it provided. That was a revelation which, in hindsight, should not have been. Once I actually sat down and started studying the razor I realized that it was pretty obvious that it should provide good, close shaves because it had comparatively a metric fuckton of blade exposure than the Mach 3 cartridges would, regardless of having 2/3 fewer blades in it.\n\nNow, don't get me wrong: I'm fully cognizant that, compared to my Wolfman/Old Types/V3A/any vintage GEM-style razor, the Merkur 34C's blade exposure is basically that of a cart (albeit probably a trac II or a Sensor cart). But compared to an actual cart it's a V3A.\n\nAnyway, another thing that I definitely remember about that day is that, on that day of my first DE razor shave, I was wholly disillusioned to Gillette's marketing bullshit about multi-blade cartridges, that stupid lubricating strip, and the dumb-ass rubber thing that's supposed to lift your hairs so the blades can cut them closer to the skin. Seriously, peddling snake oil on this level should be fucking illegal. But then, homeopathy is a thing in this country so it's not like I can really expect much in that regard.\n\nMy one fear allayed (the one about the closeness of the shaves), I came to the conclusion that this process would be exactly what I'd hoped once I figured out how to stop cutting myself. Which happened fairly quickly: I was using too much pressure (I've always been heavy-handed). I haven't looked back since.\n\n-----\nPrevious | Next\n:-|-:\n[Chapter 1: Origins](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/93xfc5/thursday_austere_august_sotd_thread_aug_02_2018/e3hvwso/)|[Chapter 3: Re-education](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/94hmt1/saturday_austere_august_sotd_thread_aug_04_2018/e3lry6p/)",

My weekend will be the fastest or most disastrous move I have ever done. The friends that are helping me move are showing up 2 hours before I need to be at the new house to receive washer and dryer delivery. Luckily I don't have much stuff but it is still going to be a bit of a rush.",

I was planning on shaving at night but my wife went into labor around 7 PM. We ended up having a healthy baby boy at 2:14 AM! 8 lbs, 7 oz and 20 inches long.\n\nThe setup at the hospital isn't exactly great for shaving and in hindsight I probably have should have just said fuck it and left my dopp bag at home. I'm in ultra nightmare mode, so trying to bring along a used blade was challenging. I ended up just leaving it in the razor and then stuck the razor inside an old plastic box that my Zenith brush came in. Seems no harm done. Definitely would have brought a synth with me as well if not for AA.\n\nSidenote: credit goes to u/falcons1583 for naming the razor. For those who don't know, this is a pieced together razor made with parts from a regular old Fatboy and an Executive, hence the name The Fat Executive. Will look good once we get back home sitting next to my Stubby Bulldog.\n\nHoping we get discharged tomorrow but it's looking more like Sunday morning. I would love to sleep in my own bed at this point.\n\nThank you to everyone who gave their well-wishes!",

Result: very good shave anyway.\n\n**Razor and Blade Notes**\nBlade still working very well.\n\nNo irritation.\n\nThe soap scent wasn't as strong this time. Maybe storing it in an open dish is helping it to reduce.\n\n*Cheek Feel During Shave*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck Feel During Shave*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Cheek Closeness After Shave*: Very Close Shave\n*Neck Closeness After Shave*: Few hairs are showing some tip length (with most being cut flush)\n\n**Soap Notes**\nTried 45 sec load but brush may not have soaked enough, due to the speedy shave. Will try repeat of 45s load next time with same 2tsp water.\n\nScent strength 3-4/10.\n\nSlick as usual and very protective!\n\nPast attempts:\n\n* 1 min of loading and 2.5 tsp of water was a little to thin.\n* 1 min load w/ .5 tsp wtr fm start = lather perhaps right on target if not justa bit thick. This gave me a lather that was drier (than yesterday's) on first pass and perfect by 3rd. and I ended up wtih too much lather.\n\n**Brush Notes**\nJust realized this use that this is fairly dense for a boar (at least the ones I've tried), but it is a low-backbone knot. The shafts, and some tips, still offer all the scrub I need, and it splays very easily. With its comfort, it's a joy to use. And it holds a good deal of soap at this point.\n",

I've never in my life shaved 4 days in a row, so I've only been shaving with the grain once, then across the grain once. No against the grain this month or else I won't need to shave the following day. The Semogue is plenty soft but it doesn't hold much lather yet. Plenty for a 2 pass shave, but I'd struggle doing a 3 pass plus a cleanup if I had to.",

So four days in, I feel my lathers are getting worse. I'm moving the brush over my face and it feels like wet bristles, no soap. I've been loading and reloading longer each day, and I'm not exactly new at Proraso, but I'm having that crisis moment that I really don't know what I'm doing. I had a routine but either it's changed or I wasn't doing it right from the start. My lathers seem too wet, not slick or protective, even after loading about 150 swirls. I mean, at least I'm not cutting myself, but I have some soul searching to do.\n\nGood shaves and the like, boys.\n",

On the other hand, it's also quite different from a cartridge razor, but not in the way you've been taught.\n\nI actually always got great shaves from cartridge razors. The shave itself had nothing to do with me switching over to a safety razor. I think I was a couple of years into this when online communities started cropping up around the topic of shaving, but I would read their essays, blogs, forum conversations et al sometimes because it's kind of what I do when I can't sleep at night, and I started to read these stories of people having horrible shaves filled with irritation and ingrown hairs with their carts. That was never my experience with them. It took me quite a while to figure out why that was.\n\nThe thing about carts that most people don't realize is that they have an optimal blade angle just like a DE, and the pivot on the head doesn't find that for you. Marketing Snake Oil again. You fake it and work around that limitation by pressing harder, which then becomes the hardest habit to break when switching over to a DE. A DE has fewer training wheels and so at first pressure is what kills you because you're accustomed to needing too much of it. It definitely killed me for a while. There's a reason that I picked *Let It Bleed* as the soundtrack for this essay.\n\nBeing fairly naturally heavy-handed, it took me quite a while to teach myself how much pressure was appropriate for my 34C. I caught onto the angle right away. More precisely, I was able to figure out an effective angle quickly. It took quite a bit longer to catch onto optimal angles, but I digress.\n\nToo much pressure is what cuts you. I nicked myself quite a lot back in those days, but the thing about nicks is that they heal. Nicks are literally nothing to be afraid of. You really can't do irreparable damage to yourself with one of these (there's one exception to this in my den. I used it last Tuesday). They call these things safety razors for a reason. Do not be afraid of shaving cuts. They're annoying at worst.\n\nI'd say that, within two months give or take, I'd found a comfort zone in which I could get a great shave with no nicks and no irritation pretty much every time. I stayed in that zone, with minimal deviation, for the next 4 or 5 years.\n\n-----\nPrevious | Next\n:-|-:\n[Chapter 2: That Fateful Day](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/947s2a/friday_austere_august_sotd_thread_aug_03_2018/e3jcmx7/)|[Chapter 4: The Most Frugalest Shave](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/94qerx/sunday_austere_august_sotd_thread_aug_05_2018/e3onj47/)",

No irritation.\n\n*Cheek Feel During Shave*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck Feel During Shave*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Cheek Closeness After Shave*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck Closeness After Shave*: Cut flush to where I just see the tips (above average for me)\n\n**Soap Notes**\nAll of the lathers I've made so far for Williams in August were good ones. So, by all this tweaking, i'm not trying to discover a good one... I'm trying to find the reasonable best one, a great one that anyone would thoroughly enjoy. I'm trying to get to \"Dang, Williams!\"\n\n45s of loading and 2 tsp water, with me adding 1/2 tsp water to top of soap before loading, was about the right amount of lather, and I was well protected. This is a good lather, but I might like to tweak my settings to get it more rich and creamy, with a little more cushion. I wonder if adding that much water while loading was too much too fast. Maybe will try blooming the puck next time instead of adding water right away.\n\nScent strength\nDay 1-2: 3-4/10\nDay 4: 2-3/10\n\nI'm glad the citronella scent is starting to fade some.\n\nSlick as usual and very protective! Only thing missing was more cushion/luxury.\n\nPast attempts:\n\n* 1 min of loading and 2.5 tsp of water was a little to thin.\n* 1 min load w/ .5 tsp wtr fm start = lather perhaps right on target if not justa bit thick. This gave me a lather that was drier (than yesterday's) on first pass and perfect by 3rd. and I ended up wtih too much lather.\n",

This blade finally felt smooth and comfortable and then my second to last stroke *whack*. Somehow I managed to dig in and slice myself pretty good on the middle of my throat. I can't say I've *ever* done that before. Not on my first shave, not a month in, not ever. Just a complete anomaly on an otherwise smooth and perfect shave. Shaving is weird sometimes.",

I could not load enough soap for two passes, much less three, and since i face lather i could not bring out the potential of the soap so i said screw it. Old spice to me is a scent better in cool times so i went to my favorite.\n\nnow the shave: i could actually get to enjoy the soap, for being 30+ years old it lathered great, obviously the scent has long since dissipated, but the cushion and slickness remained.",

But lather was too airy and had to be rescued.\n\n**Razor and Blade Notes**\nNo problems here!\n\n*Cheek Feel During Shave*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck Feel During Shave*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Cheek Closeness After Shave*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck Closeness After Shave*: Cut flush to where I just see the tips (above average for me)\n\n**Soap Notes**\nGood lathers, but trying to get to \"Dang, Williams!\"\n\nBlooming for 6 mins, 45s of loading and 1.75 tsp water, with me adding 1/2 tsp water to top of soap before loading, did not produce lather as good as previous day. Had to rescue it by going back to tub. Then it was creamy.\n\nScent strength\nDay 1-2: 3-4/10\nDay 4-5: 2-3/10\n\nOn day 4 the scent wasn't noticeable while shaving, and that continues to next day. Yay!\n\nSlick as usual and very protective! Only thing missing was more cushion/luxury.\n\nPast attempts:\n\n* 1 min of loading and 2.5 tsp of water was a little to thin.\n* 1 min load w/ .5 tsp wtr fm start = lather perhaps right on target if not justa bit thick. This gave me a lather that was drier (than yesterday's) on first pass and perfect by 3rd. and I ended up wtih too much lather.\n* 45s of loading and 2 tsp water, with me adding 1/2 tsp water to top of soap before loading, was about the right amount of lather, and I was well protected. This is a good lather, but I might like to tweak my settings to get it more rich and creamy",

After 4 days it took approximately 0.1oz off the tub weight! So, it would appear that each shave is using approximately 0.025oz.

I started taking Will's advice on \"the how to lather Reserve\" video and just hitting all my soaps with a sopping wet brush. I figured this would be the best way to finish this tub as quick as possible. Drop a sopping wet massive badger brush and load for a quick 60 seconds. Creates a shit ton of lather but it's actually pretty great. Your pretty close to properly hydrated and no worries about the brush lather hogging.\n\nThis rex still has me confused because now I'm starting to love it. Initially I wasn't too impressed but I knew I was doing something wrong. Now I've mastered the angle and on the lowest setting it's super mild and still efficient enough for me. It takes me a couple passes and some touch ups to get a good enough shave but no irritation and that's what I'm here for. I can't shave ATG anyway. I've done it with success with the Rex and the day of the shave I'm fine. It's when the hair grows back that the irritation starts in, so not the razors fault. I just can't do it. I love how solid the blade is held in this razor though. Makes for a great shaver. I might be picking this over the Karve at this point but we will see once August is over. I'm gonna own 1 razor and it's between those two.\n\nWe'll see who wins.",

The Futur is smoother than my other razors, so I guess I've been giving it a death grip. Lightening up made the shave much better.\n\nSimilar deal with the brush: it's been eating lather, and I realize that's probably because I've been splaying it constantly. Today I used delicate, painter-like strokes, didn't splay it at all, and got better results. Still should have reloaded before the third pass, but at least the first two were way more consistent than they have been.\n\nOverall, though, I'm realizing I might not be a badger guy. Still 26 days to become one... üò¨",

My wife subbed for a pianist at a local church today and apparently the minister gave a sermon about this well-behaved toddler he encountered who said \"excuse me\" to people. It turns out he was talking about our son unknowingly (our son says that a lot, so my wife showed a picture of him to the minister, and it was our son [with me, apparently] he saw).",

Given the times, and my circumstances therein, I did a decent job at acquiring the most frugal setup that I could. I could have grabbed one of those Escali brushes that are basically ubiquitous, but fuck that; I dodged a bullet on that one. $1 soap, $35 razor, $45-ish brush, $1 blades. Not bad, all things considered.\n\nSure, I could have scoured antique shops and/or eBay to find a vintage Gillette. That may well have netted me a less expensive alternative to my Merkur 34C, and likely would have proven to be a better razor (as most would prove to be in subsequent years). Thing is, I knew fuck-all about these things back then. Possibly the closest I'd ever been to one of these razors was maybe watching M*A*S*H, or perhaps watching Bob Geldof lop off his eyebrows in *The Wall.*\n\nAll the same, if I were doing it today, I'd do some things differently. One of those areas is that of holding the blade steady and safely while I use it to shear hair off my face. If I knew then what I know now, I'd have scoured eBay for a Schick Krona or maybe an Old Type. I'm willing to bet those could be had for pennies back then.\n\nOn the other hand, if I were doing it today, today, then I'd probably have bought the razor I'm using this month: The Baili BR-171.\n\nEach piece of this month's setup represents something different. I chose the Baili to use this month as a symbol of the wisdom that age can bring, given knowledge gained over time. If I were doing it now, I'd also change the rest of my kit, but let's focus this Baili for a bit. If you're looking to put together the least expensive kit possible, then you seriously need to consider this razor. It's a ridiculously good value; perhaps the best razor out there for the money. I think I paid about $6 for mine, and I don't regret a single penny of that. It has a handle that I'm convinced is chrome plated brass. It feels much to heavy to be a zinc alloy. The head may well be zinc, but I've no way to measure that. One of these days, I'll buy a 2nd one and run some tests. The handle is great feeling: comfortable and well balanced. It's a good, smooth shaver, with very little blade feel. I have, ah...certain views on whether this is a good thing for a novice wet shaver, but perhaps we can talk about that another time. It's a fine gateway from the utter mildness of a cart.\n\nIf I were starting out today, in the same financial position that I was back then,and I had the advantage of the 15 years of knowledge that I've gained, I'd buy this razor and perhaps never want for another. Perhaps.\n\nBah, who am I kidding? I'd probably still bumble into a bunch of other products and develop RAD.\n\n-----\nPrevious | Next\n:-|-:\n[Chapter 3: Re-education](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/94hmt1/saturday_austere_august_sotd_thread_aug_04_2018/e3lry6p/)|[Chapter 5:Actually the 2nd Most Frugalest Shave](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/94zhvn/monday_austere_august_sotd_thread_aug_06_2018/e3pck5h/)",

Very good shave.\n\n**Razor and Blade Notes**\nDoing great. No irritation!\n\n*Cheek Feel During Shave*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck Feel During Shave*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Cheek Closeness After Shave*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck Closeness After Shave*: Cut flush to where I just see the tips (above average for me)\n\n**Soap Notes**\nGood lathers, but trying to get to \"Dang, Williams!\"\n\nSlow loading, gradually adding drops of water, seemed to load the brush with thicker soap, but when started to mix lather, got airy as has in past. Had to rescue it by going back to tub. Then it was creamy and great for all 3 passes.\n\nNext time will try longer bloom, I think. Theory: 6 mins from 2 days ago may not have been long enough.\n\nScent strength\nDay 1-2: 3-4/10\nDay 4-5: 2-3/10\nDay 6: 2/10\n\nSlick as usual and very protective!\n\nPast attempts:\n\n* 1 min of loading and 2.5 tsp of water was a little to thin.\n* 1 min load w/ .5 tsp wtr fm start = lather perhaps right on target if not justa bit thick. This gave me a lather that was drier (than yesterday's) on first pass and perfect by 3rd. and I ended up wtih too much lather.\n* 45s of loading and 2 tsp water, with me adding 1/2 tsp water to top of soap before loading, was about the right amount of lather, and I was well protected. This is a good lather, but I might like to tweak my settings to get it more rich and creamy\n* Blooming for 6 mins, 45s of loading and 1.75 tsp water, with me adding 1/2 tsp water to top of soap before loading, did not produce lather as good as previous day.\n\n**Brush Notes**\nHolding enough lather for 3 passes at only 11 uses. Nice.\n",

I don't shave nearly as often as most of you guys so it's probably gonna be easier for me but as soon as this blade goes to shit I'm not even gonna bother, it's going in the trash. Not worth the irritation to me. I've never used a blade more than maybe 5 times so I'm curious to see how long this will go. Seems a bit excessive to use such a large brush for a quick two pass shave on very little growth but I like going into Monday's fresh because work fucking sucks. Seville makes Monday's feel okay. But nothing makes work feel okay, people who say they love their job are **liars.**",

She knows she's not supposed to do it too, because she hid when she heard me coming. She just doesn't give a shit.\n\nBlade's holding up strong so far, but I am reeeeeally wanting to try my new (to me) Shick Injector that I picked up from the flea market recently now that I have blades for it.

It's also one of the least good, but I didn't know that at the time. Besides, cheap products are a helluva drug. If Declaration's Icarus base had existed when I got into the game, I wouldn't have been able to afford it anyway.\n\nWilliams was affordable and easily obtainable, and so I used it exclusively for at least a few years. It's an effective if not particularly enjoyable soap, but if it's your only soap, then you don't know the difference anyway, and so it's just fine. That said, its price is probably the best thing going for it. If I were to do it all over, given yesterday's criteria, I'd definitely trade Williams for another soap.\n\nThat soap would be Cella. If you're one of those price per oz. guys, you're overthinking it. Stop that. This isn't bulk grains we're talking about here. That said, if you care about such things, Cella in the 1kg size looks like it's going for about $0.01/g less than Williams right now, so all those savings could be yours.\n\nFor my part, Cella is 1000x the soap that Williams is and it's nearly comparable in price. That's good enough. I also happen to love the scent, which is a plus.\n\nBut in 2003 I had no idea that Cella existed, and so I used what was available and affordable. And frankly, I rather enjoyed it. Williams Mug Shaving Soap is not fancy, and it's not particularly elegant.\n\nBut then neither am I. Williams gets the job done just fine and, though it could never be mistaken as luxurious, it did right by me for a good, long time.\n\n-----\nPrevious | Next\n:-|-:\n[Chapter 4: The Most Frugalest Shave](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/94qerx/sunday_austere_august_sotd_thread_aug_05_2018/e3onj47/)|[Chapter 6: Frugal Shmugal or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Luxury Like AAAAAHHHHHHHHHH.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/959rj0/tuesday_austere_august_sotd_thread_aug_07_2018/e3t0uns/)",

I kept the same soap and brush, but went with the RazoRock Baby Smooth instead of the Fatip. That was a good choice. A much better shave. I also attacked the soap with a much wetter brush than previously and the lather was quick and voluminous. So I guess I'm still in, but not quite as in as I was.",

It's pleasant and could be a daily driver scent for me if I wasn't obsessive about my soap collection. My face feels wonderful even after shaving last night. It doesn't feel as fatty to me as some soaps during the shave, but yet it's extremely moisturizing. Must be some kind of soap making magic.",

      "body": "*Razor*: Blackland - **Dart** (Machined)\n*Blade*: **Gillette - Nacet** (9)\n*Lather*: **Williams Mug Soap**\n*Brush*: Whipped Dog - **Boar**\n*Post*: Afta - Fresh\n\n----\n\n**Ultra Nightmare Mode**\n\n[Video](https://youtu.be/suf3Wr0JNwY)\n\n**General Notes**\n**Eureka!** discovered the trail to luxurious, creamy lather from Williams! The difference today was in blooming the soap.\n\nSo one of the reasons I picked this soap for use for August was that I thought it could be a good budget option for shavers trying to save money. However, it looks like Arko or the 1kg block of Cella may be the best way to go. And Cella is simple to get a great lather from, and I love the scent!\n\nSo I guess I'll focus on those who just want to use Williams for old times sake, or it's just what they've always used, or it's just what's available.\n\n**Razor and Blade Notes**\nBlade and razor still working wonderfully together, giving me no irritation and an top notch shave. Today, with 9 uses, ties the max uses I've ever gotten from a blade. I've been working through a big sampler for a very long time. This Austere month comes at a great time for me to zoom in on one blade and work it.\n\n*Cheek Feel During Shave*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck Feel During Shave*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Cheek Closeness After Shave*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck Closeness After Shave*: Cut flush to where I just see the tips (above average for me)\n\n**Soap Notes**\nGot that creamy slick lather! but soap mix was too rich. Just a bit of fine tuning now!\n\nBloomed soap for 20 mins, 40 sec load with barely damp brush, then mix till luxuriously creamy. Loved the richness, but had too much soap in the mix. 20 sec load is probably what I should have done. I didn't mean to bloom the soap this long. Last time I bloomed, it was for 6 and that wasn't really enough. I meant to shoot for 12, but missed it by a bit.\n\nScent strength\nDay 1-2: 3-4/10\nDay 4-5: 2-3/10\nDay 6-7: 2/10\n\nSlick as usual and very protective!\n\nPast attempts:\n\n* 1 min of loading and 2.5 tsp of water was a little to thin.\n* 1 min load w/ .5 tsp wtr fm start = lather perhaps right on target if not just a bit thick. This gave me a lather that was drier (than yesterday's) on first pass and perfect by 3rd. and I ended up with too much lather.\n* 45s of loading and 2 tsp water, with me adding 1/2 tsp water to top of soap before loading, was about the right amount of lather, and I was well protected. This is a good lather, but I might like to tweak my settings to get it more rich and creamy\n* Blooming for 6 mins, 45s of loading and 1.75 tsp water, with me adding 1/2 tsp water to top of soap before loading, did not produce lather as good as previous day.\n* Slow loading, gradually adding drops of water, seemed to load the brush with thicker soap, but when started to mix lather, got airy as has in past.\n\n**Brush Notes**\nI can't wait till the end of Austere August, because I want to compare this WD boar with my SOC boar. I know the WD has more hairs, because it's a bigger knot. But I think they are similar in backbone and tip softness. My guess is that the SOC has a little more backbone and a little softer tips, but it may be so close that I might be able to recommend to someone that if they like their SOC, but want more hairs, that the WD Boar is a viable option.",

There are folks (mostly vintage junkies) who rave about these being the best blades ever (along with Personna 74). While I never truly believed them (we all know how nostalgia can cloud our judgments), I was still interested in trying. I wasn't super impressed with the 74 (very nice blades, but so are some modern ones). Anyway, some time ago I bought 5 of these from the DFS BST. Today was the first go - and I must say I am impressed, these blades are super smooth and super sharp, I felt absolutely 0 resistance. Got an absolutely 100% bbs with 3 passes and touch up. No irritation what so ever. Two thumbs up!!\n\nI had some trouble getting the best lather out of this soap in my first two tries, but since then I have gotten two fantastic shaves even though I still think I haven't reached the possible peak with this soap. Wonderful scent and menthol level.",

O. Bigelow. You already know this, but I'm reminiscing, and so here we are. Since I had proximity to a Bath & Body Works, I sauntered over to see if I could find some of this stuff and hoped that it wasn't too expensive. $10 for a tube: Not bad, though its being 10x more expensive than Williams sent me into sticker shock for a minute.\n\nStill, I decided to splurge on it because I was curious to see how it differed from the soap that had by then become like an old friend. I took it home and cracked open the tube, and marveled at the fact that it didn't smell like soap. It had a lovely, light scent of menthol and eucalyptus and that kind of blew my mind a little.\n\nThe next morning I shaved with it and marveled at how nice it was. It left my face feeling smooth rather than bare, and it was really goddamn easy to lather. Basically the opposite of Williams. Shaving with Proraso Green made me feel positively decadent. I didn't even need to use aftershave on those days that I used Proraso. That also kind of blew my mind a little.\n\nProraso opened my eyes to something that I was previously only dimly aware existed. It was my jumping off point for experimenting with new soaps once I was able to buy them. It was easy and comfortable, not finicky and utilitarian. It smelled pleasant and not sterile.\n\nProraso made me see that it was possible to view shaving as a meditative and relaxing activity. Today, I have a soap \"collection\" larger than many, and among that collection will always be a tube of Proraso Green. To this day I have a soft spot for Proraso. I always will. It taught me so much about the potential of traditional wet shaving: That there's a world out there that doesn't need to be mired in pinching pennies. That there was more to discover, and the discoveries were out there, waiting for me.\n\nAnd then I went back to Williams.\n\n-----\nPrevious | Next\n:-|-:\n[Chapter 5: Actually, The 2nd Most Frugalest Shave](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/94zhvn/monday_austere_august_sotd_thread_aug_06_2018/e3pck5h/)|[Chapter 7: Uncharted](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/95k5hx/wednesday_austere_august_sotd_thread_aug_08_2018/e3vdpz0/)",

Lather was good, but not luxury. Dialing it in, though!\n\nAnd notice how the scent strength is lessening as we go on! Which I don't mind, because it's turning into a light, clean, soapy scent from the strong citronella.\n\n**Razor and Blade Notes**\nSetup still strong. Did have to go back and do touchups in my neck trouble spots. Don't know fi the blade is losing it's top-notch edge, or if my angle/technique wasn't on point.\n\n*Cheek Feel During Shave*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck Feel During Shave*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Cheek Closeness After Shave*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck Closeness After Shave*: Cut flush to where I just see the tips (above average for me)\n\n**Soap Notes**\nGot that creamy slick lather! but soap mix was too rich. Just a bit of fine tuning now!\n\nBloomed soap for 15 mins, 20 sec load with barely damp brush, then mix till creamy. But didn't get luxurious. I was going by look and it looked like it needed more water. But with Williams, I think I have to go by feel. I think I may keep the 20 second load, but just add ~~2.5~~ 1.5 tsp instead of 2 tsp. Again, I didn't mean to bloom the soap for 17 mins. I think that if I soak the puck first thing, then by the time I need it, the soap will be ready. As long as that is 10-15 mins, that might just be fine.\n\nScent strength\nDay 1-2: 3-4/10\nDay 4-5: 2-3/10\nDay 6-7: 2/10\nDay 8: 1/10\n\nSlick as usual and very protective!\n\nPast attempts:\n\n* 1 min of loading and 2.5 tsp of water was a little to thin.\n* 1 min load w/ .5 tsp wtr fm start = lather perhaps right on target if not just a bit thick. This gave me a lather that was drier (than yesterday's) on first pass and perfect by 3rd. and I ended up with too much lather.\n* 45s of loading and 2 tsp water, with me adding 1/2 tsp water to top of soap before loading, was about the right amount of lather, and I was well protected. This is a good lather, but I might like to tweak my settings to get it more rich and creamy\n* Blooming for 6 mins, 45s of loading and 1.75 tsp water, with me adding 1/2 tsp water to top of soap before loading, did not produce lather as good as previous day.\n* Slow loading, gradually adding drops of water, seemed to load the brush with thicker soap, but when started to mix lather, got airy as has in past.\n* Bloomed soap for 20 mins, 40 sec load with barely damp brush, then mix till luxuriously creamy. Loved the richness, but had too much soap in the mix.",

I do not have a very strong preference for either mild or aggressive razors (but sometimes I tend to like a bit blade feel) and I think efficiency is mostly dependent on the user, not the tool. So I judge a razor almost completely on how smooth it feels going ATG. I used my 0.54 wolf for 20+ days straight but couldn't find a way to shave ATG without some tugging/pulling. Also, I got alum sting after every shave.\n\nBut just with the first try, I got a significantly better shave with 67. The areas of my face where I suffered with '54 wolf', was super comfortable today. Now, I think I can get better shaves than this with my favorite DEs (34C, BlackBird, CG2) but I am very optimistic about spending some time with 67 and getting better.\n\nI must thank /u/uncle_dubya who (along with a few others) kind of convinced me to try a different gap wolf.\n\nWith the darwin handle, the razor weighs 80 grams which is just about perfect for me.",

This is my first shave using it and it just knocked my socks off. So easy to lather, so easy to reapply after each pass. Extremely slick, even when i had to go back and do some touch ups between passes; because of the quality all I had to do was add a little bit of water to the area and it was as slick as if I had just reapplied lather. Wonderful stuff. The shave was all around better today as well, maybe I was just in a better mood, but everything seemed to go better. The Voskhod blade still tugged when shaving my chin area, so I'm thinking Feather may be my next try.\n\nPost shave was excellent as well, the samples of both the splash and the soap were incredible. Theres a little bit of a tight feel to my face after using the splash, but it's good, it's not a painful tightness. I'm definitely going to buy a tub and full bottle of splash but will it be classic or cool, not sure yet. I may need to try the lavender and fern before I make a final decision.",

After I discovered it, I basically went directly back to Williams because, well, I'd grown to take comfort in it, quirks and all. I didn't mind its persnickety nature; I'd become accustomed to it after 3 years of familiarity. This familiarity did not breed content. Quite the opposite, in fact: On learning how to use Williams effectively, I actually gained a great deal of respect for the soap. I didn't mind its plain, soapy scent or its utter dearth of skin food; these qualities left me feeling and smelling clean and cleansed after a shave.\n\nBut Proraso...that was something new! And seeing something outside of my norm was exciting! It made me wonder what else was out there.\n\nWhen I was in my mid-to-late teens, I pretty much always used Aqua Velva as an aftershave. I loved the smell of it, and in fact still do like it quite a bit (that's maybe why I'm such a sucker for chypres). Once in a while, I'd splash on some Old Spice in what was probably a vain attempt to emulate my maternal grandfather, but Old Spice was never a scent with which I could really jive. I discovered a strong appreciation for the scent much later, but that's neither here nor there.\n\nOne day, when I was...oh, 20-ish years old I think, I'd run out of aftershave and during a shopping run couldn't fine Aqua Velva for whatever reason. Presumably the store was out of stock. At any rate, I stood looking at the shelf of aftershaves and on a whim I grabbed a bottle of Nivea Men Sensitive Post Shave Balm. After a few uses I really came to enjoy that stuff. It was much more nourishing-feeling on my face than Aqua Velva had ever been, and I quite liked its light, aquatic scent. It became my go-to aftershave for a good many years thereafter.\n\nTruth be told, I still quite like this stuff. Nearly all of the artisan blends that are available today are eleventy billion times better than it, true, but for its part it's a good balm.\n\nDuring my Williams/Nivea years, after I'd discovered Proraso, I made it a point to try out new things as they came across my radar and when I had the funds to do so. Over the course of a year or two, I tried out a handful of different shaving products. It was during those years that I discovered the utter majesty that is Pinaud Clubman. I added that to my aftershave rotation, but I didn't use it a ton because I liked the face feel of the Nivea balm so much. The ever-growing availability of online shops helped a lot with this. I tried Trumper's Skin Food briefly during that time but, though delightful, it was much too expensive for my budget. I also tried Trumper's soap, the Infamous Col. Conk, and some others.\n\nBut I always ended up going back to Williams and Nivea. I used some soaps that were better than Williams (Conk not counting among those), but they were all also much more expensive. I tried some aftershaves whose scents I liked more than Nivea, but none of them matched its face feel vs. its price. After an admittedly small amount of product exploration, I settled happily back into the routine of Williams and Nivea.\n\nI stuck to that routine for nearly another decade. The sole exception to this was the errant bottle of Clubman, and what became the ever-present tube of Proraso Green. Proraso became my \"special occasion\" cream; I'd use it to shave on those days when I had something I'd deemed important, or perhaps when I felt that I deserved extra pampering. For the most part, though, it was Williams and Nivea on the daily.\n\nI don't regret any of the exploration I did even though it proved to be largely fruitless. I also don't regret the routine. The former set me up to really dive into the artisan community once it actually became a thing and I discovered it, and through that I've made a lot of good friendships which have become much more important to me than the products themselves or some dumb shaves. The latter, because routine is a Good Thing. It allows one to learn and practice without introducing extra unknowns that variety can breed.\n\nThat routine afforded me the opportunity to hone my technique in a way that I think would have been impossible if I were using a different soap each and every day during those early, learning years. The things I write, the advice and opinions I offer, the questions I answer, the perspective from which I do all of these, I believe comes directly from the years spent with Williams, Nivea and my 34C.\n\n-----\nPrevious | Next\n:-|-:\n[Chapter 6: Frugal Shmugal or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Luxury Like AAAAAHHHHHHHHHH.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/959rj0/tuesday_austere_august_sotd_thread_aug_07_2018/e3t0uns/)|[Chapter 8: Sailing the Seas of Steel](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/95ujsu/thursday_austere_august_sotd_thread_aug_09_2018/e3xnxlu/)",

I hope you all have a great weekend.",

No irritation though.\n\n**Razor and Blade Notes**\nMy trouble spot neck hairs have started evading a close cutting, maybe, 2 shaves ago. I thought it was my technique, but after focusing on that tonight, I now think it is the blade. Obviously, the blade is not going to cut at maximum efficiency forever, and I gues those piece-of-crap neck hairs require the edge to be at it's best.\n\nSo now this is the second phase of the Nacet's edge, where every other part of my face is still shaved very well (almost BBS on my cheeks), but a few stragglers are left on my neck. (If I could go ATG on my neck, I'm sure I'd still be getting BBS.)\n\n*Cheek Feel During Shave*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck Feel During Shave*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Cheek Closeness After Shave*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck Closeness After Shave*: Few hairs are showing some tip length (with most being cut flush)\n\n**Soap Notes**\nGood lather, but I want it richer!\n\nBloomed soap for 11 mins, 20 sec load with barely damp brush, then ended up adding to a total of 1 2/3 tsp water. Again, was a good, slick, light-cushion lather, but didn't get luxurious. I wanted to back off the water (stop adding it earlier), which I did, but it wasn't by much. I should hve checked the slickness with my fingers earlier. I think I may keep the 20 second load, but increase the bloom/soak time and add 1.5 tsp of water instead of 2 tsp. I added water to the puck first thing, then prepared my shaving area. But that only took about 6 mins. So it looks like I will need to stop by the bathroom a few minutes before the shave and start the soak.\n\nScent strength\nDay 1-2: 3-4/10\nDay 4-5: 2-3/10\nDay 6-7: 2/10\nDay 8-9: 1/10\n\nSlick as usual and very protective!\n\n",

It's been working absolutely fine for every shave, but its appearance does not instill confidence - it always seems too airy no matter what I do. I made sure to load it with a barely-not-dripping wet brush for 15 seconds. From there I just lathered and lathered, and added and added water. The brush was flinging lather absolutely everywhere, but I kept working it and adding water anyway. Finally got something resembling a shiny and protective lather after adding about 4x as much water as I thought should be acceptable. Still somewhat baffled by it all and will continue experimenting, not like I have a choice.",

Absolutely slick enough, scent is great, post shave is great.\n\nInteresting on this blade, which has now hit shave #6, it's gotten very, very smooth. I had the Fatboy dialed up to 9 today and still super smooth. I know the blade gaps can often be off on these vintage adjustables but I tuned this one myself, so I know the gaps are set to factory specs. That said, it's got to be this blade mellowing out. Hopefully the shaves continue to be smooth and efficient. The efficiency is the part I'm worried about down the road.",

Time to switch gears.*\n\nLet's talk about blades, baby. Let's talk about my razor and me. Let's talk about all the good shaves, and the bad shaves, that may be. Let's talk about blades.\n\nI love blades. They're so much fun. It's amazing how much they can change a shave, given that they look like about the most consistent part to the naked eye. I've always found it a bit enchanting that the material, coating and grind differences on those little things can make such a drastic difference in how the shave feels. It's completely counter-intuitive and yet one can veritably drown in the sea of YMMVs, exploration advice and countless other pieces of assorted bullshit and misinformation that gets thrown around these places weekly, if not daily.\n\nBlade exploration is fairly important, but not as important as developing proper technique. One of the downsides to dropping into this place at this time is that you're immediately bombarded with information overload, and it's hard to digest all at once, so it's small wonder that people ask the same questions over and over. It's a shame that we rebuke them when they do. I've been guilty of this on a number of occasions, but my excuse is that I'm a bitter curmudgeon.\n\nThe secret to blade exploration that the pros don't want you to know is that it's ok to stop when you find a blade that gives you a shave that's \"good enough.\" We do way too much chasing of unicorns in this hobby: The Perfect Lather^TM , The Perfect Razor^TM , The Perfect Blade^TM .\n\nTHE PERFECT SHAVE^TM\n\nThe thing that they don't teach you in those YouTube tutorials is that a lot of this is simply masturbation (as an aside, if you're going to devote hours upon hours of your life perfecting something, pick that: you'll be much more fulfilled). The other thing they don't teach you is that shooting for something that's basically unobtainable when you just start out is a recipe for disappointment at best, and disaster at worst.\n\nLearn the process first, then play with all the gear. Get a sample pack of blades and use them. If you put one in your razor, and it feels super terrible, throw it out and try another. Once you find one that gives you an acceptable shave, stick with it. Use 10 or 20 of those, and work on improving your technique above all. Once your technique is sound, then feel free to experiment with new gear. It's definitely worth doing eventually, because you might find gear that you really love using. And you also might gain an appreciation even for gear that you don't love. There's a lot of gear out there, and a lot of it is really very cool.\n\nBut if you keep screwing around with unknowns while you still don't know what you're doing, then pretty much everything is going to end up sucking, and that's no way to go through this.\n\n-----\nPrevious | Next\n:-|-:\n[Chapter 7: Uncharted.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/95k5hx/wednesday_austere_august_sotd_thread_aug_08_2018/e3vdpz0/)|[Chapter 9:Vintage](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/9653lq/friday_austere_august_sotd_thread_aug_10_2018/e3zsign/)",

Had a pretty wet brush, again, just damper than dripping, and rather than mashing it in the tub and loading angrily, I did it very gently, letting the the soap work its way into the brush little by little. By doing this, I avoided both the foam and slinging the suds everywhere. From there, I worked it in a little bit and pretty quickly had (finally!!) a very good looking lather. From yesterday's shave, I was thinking I might want to add water after seeing what an insane amount this soap could take. Instead I played it save so as to not make a mess, and I didn't find it to be too dried out at all. Next time I might risk it and see how wet and shiny I can get it, but for now I'm glad to have landed on a lathering method that I'm satisfied with.",

The Flowers in the Dark EdT, while it smells great, doesn't have that much staying power. A very nice member of this sub three in a decant of Aventus on a soap trade, and this is its first use. Kind of a fruity opening settling into spice. I have bad allergies today, though, so it's now an hour after I sprayed it in, and I can no longer smell it. I don't think it's the fragrance's fault, though.",

Good lather, but will thicken it up just a bit more.\n\n**Razor and Blade Notes**\nVery good combo still. Continues to leave a few tips exposed in my toughest-to-get neck area, but everywhere else is way above average. No irritation, though.\n\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Few hairs are showing some tip length (with most being cut flush)\n\n**Soap Notes**\nGood lather, but I want it richer!\n\nBloomed soap for 20 mins, 20 sec load with barely damp brush, then ended up adding to a total of 1.5 tsp water. Again, was a good, slick, light-cushion lather, but didn't get luxurious. I think I may change this only by adding time to the load. I think an extra 10 secs, while keeping the water the same may increase the soap ratio where I want it for creaminess.\n\nScent strength\nDay 1-2: 3-4/10\nDay 4-5: 2-3/10\nDay 6-7: 2/10\nDay 8-10: 1/10\n\nSlick as usual and very protective!\n\n----\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger**\n\nHey, I was wondering if we wanted to document somewhere how long our blades lasted for this month, and what about them made us pitch 'em. So I created a Google Form with just a few questions, if anyone is interested:\n\n[Ending of Blades Ledger](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform)\n\nI'll keep this as my footer each day so you have the link. I'll take it down if no one shows interest.\n\n----\n\nUpdate: removed past attempts log\n",

      "body": "# SOTD: 10 August 2018\n\n### Augusterity: Day 10 (MTNG'S Ultra-Nightmare Mode)\n\n***Pre-Shave:*** *Hot water splashes, proto-lather.*\n\n***Lather:*** *Williams Mug Shaving Soap.*\n\n***Brush:*** *Declaration Grooming Custom w/B5 Knoot.*\n\n***Razor:*** *Baili* BR-171 *w/Gillette 7 O'Clock Super Platinum blade (10).*\n\n***Post-Shave:*** *Extra lather, cold water splashes, Nivea Men* Sensitive *Post Shave Balm.*\n\n***Soundtrack:*** Ummagumma *by Pink Floyd.*\n\n##### Chapter 9: Vintage.\n\nMy first vintage razor was a Gillette Super Adjustable with a date code of I2, which puts it at the 2nd quarter of 1988-the last production run ever of a DE Gillette razor in the U.S. Well, actually, they may have made the black handle super speed until the end of 1988, but I've never seen one from that year so I'm not sure. I do know that they stopped production of the Super Adjustable after Q2 1988, so I have the last one ever to come off the line. Or something.\n\nThis particular razor was manufactured the year before I started shaving.\n\nSadly, it's the crappy, post-1976 model with the crappy black plastic adjuster plate, but I'll never get rid of it because it's the last one ever. I'd like to pick up an older model with the metal adjuster plate, but since there's not one available in my birth quarter (because Gillette sucks at the suckness), it really hasn't been a priority so far.\n\nCoincidentally, it's also the first vintage razor I ever repaired.\n\nI bought it sometime around Aught-Six. That's about the time I remember your Badgers+Blades et al starting to really come into their own. I'd been reading a bit about vintage Gillettes, and became interested in trying one out. I mean, how much cooler would this old-timey method of shaving be with a properly old-timey razor?\n\nI also learned that adjustable razors were a thing around this time, and reasoned that it would be better to try one of those because the other kinds that I'd seen would likely be very similar to my Merkur, and that would be boring.\n\n*So, yes, there was a time at which I thought a Gillette Old Type would probably shave just like a Merkur 34C. You should maybe never take my advice about anything shaving-related.*\n\nAfter looking into them for some time, I also reasoned that those ones with the black handles were much less expensive than the models that were all silver, so I ended up buying one of the black handled ones.\n\nI had no idea what a date code was back then, and neither did most of the rest of the internet. There was [an old GeoCities site](http://web.archive.org/web/20000301130728/http://www.geocities.com:80/safetyrazors/gil_ser2.htm) that had some (partially, maybe largely incorrect) information about these razors' provenance, but I didn't even learn about this site until a bit later. You may know it now as the venerable http://www.safetyrazors.net/.\n\n*I had a GeoCities site back in 1996. It's mercifully gone from the world now, and perhaps more mercifully unarchived by the wayback machine. Mad props to Yahoo! for putting it out of its misery.*\n\nSo now I owned a vintage Gillette adjustable that I was eventually able to determine was younger than I. And it had a head that was very slightly bent such that one end of the blade's edge had slightly more gap than the other, which seemed to get worse the higher the adjustment setting. It made the shave...unpredictable.\n\nI'd read some forum posts about folks who used these things by constantly changing the adjustment to match their passes, so being the seasoned pro that I was, I figured I'd give that a shot because it seemed like a waste to just set it at a setting and leave it there; I mean, think of all that squandered adjustability!\n\nAnd boy did I lacerate my face to the bejeezus belt with that move. After that I played with different settings to see what I liked, and eventually settled on dialing it all the way up to the top. That gave it nearly 1.5x the blade gap that my 34C has. Unfortunately, it also had that bent head thing, so I still ended up going back to the 34C as my daily driver. Ol' Faithful, that one.\n\nFor years I would take that thing out, shave with it once or twice, cut the shit out of myself, and put it away for months at a time. Then, maybe 3 years ago, I stumbled on a forum post somewhere that went into some detail about the kinds of issues one can run into with those old Gillette TTO models, and how to repair them. I took mine out of its box, gave it a thorough inspection, determined what I thought the issue was, and took a pair of pliers to it. After a few minutes' work, I loaded a blade to test it out and found that the gap was perfectly even again.\n\nSo the next morning I dialed that fucker up to 9 and shaved with it, and goddamn that shave was divine. I couldn't believe how good that much blade felt. I'd also finally realized how awesomely these old-ass razors performed. I developed an affinity for both vintage razors and blade feel that day, and as a result have spent the last 3 years searching out both. I've found a couple of doozies in the blade feel department, and several old razors that are not only beautiful shavers, but beautifully designed as well. Some of the ones in my collection are probably legitimate heirlooms, but since I don't really care all that much about that kind of thing, most are just user grade. Still, nearly all of them are amazing, even pushing 100 years old.\n\nMy favorite razor is probably still my Wolfman, though XD\n\n-----\nPrevious | Next\n:-|-:\n[Chapter 8: Sailing the Seas of Steel](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/95ujsu/thursday_austere_august_sotd_thread_aug_09_2018/e3xnxlu/)|[Chapter 10: Mulligan](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/96f288/saturday_austere_august_sotd_thread_aug_11_2018/e41nxiw/)",

I'm really interested now to see just how long this blade can last. It's still feeling sharp and smooth. I know I haven't been shaving every day and I could have 11 shaves on this blade already, but I usually change a DE blade out after 4 shaves anyway. This is the first blade out of a 100 pack of Perma-Sharps that I just picked up recently...it may take me a very long time to kill that pack.\n\nSpeaking of things that are hard to kill, has anyone killed a Reserve soap? I'm following the whole \"25 swirls\" thing and it's working perfectly for me, but I end up using so little soap that I get the feeling that I'll never finish it. Not that I'd want to anytime soon with this soap, I'm just curious.",

I don't like football. The only reason I know it's football season is that tonight is the first Broncos pre-season game. And since I work the games, *presto! * I know shit.\n\nIt's not that I'm not a Broncos fan, I'm just not a football fan. It's actually entertaining as I walk the stadium, fans reach out for high fives and want to celebrate. They then look horrified when I tell them I have no idea what's going on.\n\nAh well. Pays good.\n\n[Happy Foosball errbody.](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ISsitarQHDg/hqdefault.jpg)",

I learned something about adding water this time. And I can't smell the Williams any more during use.\n\n**Razor and Blade Notes**\nWorked well. Having to do touch-ups now, though. I guess the blade is becoming less crazy sharp.\n\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Few hairs are showing some tip length (with most being cut flush)\n\n**Soap Notes**\nGood lather, but I want it richer!\n\nBloomed soap for 20 mins, 30 sec load with barely damp brush, then ended up adding to a total of 0.5 tsp water... because it felt thin. I had never stopped this early before and decided to try it. Didn't work. When I put it on my face, it started to clump up, and ended up requiring more water. Very strange. So I should now assume that with Williams, thinness of lather, as you build, may not be a reliable indicator. Next time, I'm just going to add all the water and not stop.\n\nSide note... since the lather seemed a bit airy, I decided to build another lather from scratch and use a badger brush ... to see if the brush material is what makes a difference. This one turned out perfect. I got sweet, creamy lather! Just two differences: 1) badger brush, and 2) I kept adding the water. So tomorrow, I'll see if I can figure out which difference was the key.\n\nScent strength\nDay 1-2: 3-4/10\nDay 4-5: 2-3/10\nDay 6-7: 2/10\nDay 8-10: 1/10\nDay 11: 0/10 (can't smell it any more while lathering)\n\nSlick as usual and very protective!\n\n----\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger**\n\nUse this to document how long our blades last for this month, and what about them made us pitch 'em. I created a Google Form with just a few questions, if anyone is interested:\n\n[Ending of Blades Ledger](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform)\n\nI'll keep this as my footer each day so you have the link. I'll take it down if no one shows interest.",

      "body": "# SOTD: 11 August 2018\n\n### Augusterity: Day 11 (MTNG'S Ultra-Nightmare Mode)\n\n***Pre-Shave:*** *Hot water splashes, proto-lather.*\n\n***Lather:*** *Williams Mug Shaving Soap.*\n\n***Brush:*** *Declaration Grooming Custom w/B5 Knoot.*\n\n***Razor:*** *Baili* BR-171 *w/Gillette 7 O'Clock Super Platinum blade (11).*\n\n***Post-Shave:*** *Extra lather, cold water splashes, Nivea Men* Sensitive *Post Shave Balm.*\n\n***Soundtrack:*** Thick As a Brick *by Jethro Tull.*\n\n##### Chapter 10: Mulligan.\n\nI'd mentioned previously that, if I had it to do over again given the same budget, I'd have used Cella rather than Williams. I think I stand by that. The only soap that I could think of that might dethrone Cella in the overall value department is Pr√© de Provence because, being triple-milled (some claim quadruple), it lasts freaking forever. Also, I love both the original scent and that of *No. 63,* and the soap is an excellent performer.\n\nI'd also mentioned that I probably would have gone with the Baili BR-171 and never wanted for another razor, and that's really just not true at all. Writing about my Super Adjustable last night reminded me of it: I adore blade feel. I can't get enough of it. I'd still love to try out a 2011 M√ºhle R41 just to see what all the fuss is about.\n\nThe Baili BR-171 is quite a mild razor. It shaves very well, but it has almost no blade feel. As such, there's just no way I would be fulfilled shaving with it forever and ever (amen). I mean, I guess if I never knew that razors could have lots of delicious blade feel, then I wouldn't know what I was missing and thus would be fine. However, I feel that I probably wouldn't have enjoyed it as much as I eventually came to do.\n\nSo scouring eBay for an Old Type or maybe a NEW probably would have made good economic sense in those days, but nowadays perhaps less so. At least for an Old Type; they can get up there in price quickly, and good luck finding one without a cracked handle (though those are easily repaired if the cracks aren't super bad). The last time I looked, NEWs were only going for about $25, which is still less than I paid for my 34C.\n\nThis afternoon, I was chatting with /u/iamsms, /u/Old_Hiker, and /u/Hyvasuomi79 about Schick Injector razors, and was reminded of my Schick G8, which I've affectionately named Donatien Alfonse Fran√ßois. This razor is the harshest fucking thing I've ever had come into contact with my face other than my ex-wife. I've alternately described it as like shaving with a live shark, feeling like a peeled potato after a shave, and simply a harsh mistress. Shaving with this thing is like spending a night at [Mrs. Rod's boarding school for young women](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Q6jSP1dQ28).\n\nI'm saying that it's really quite harsh.\n\nThe point here is that it's harsh af because its head and spring were bent when I received it. I've managed to mostly bend it back into some semblance of shape, but it's still extremely unforgiving. That's kind of what one's up against when hunting down relics of a bygone era. Sometimes you get stuff that just doesn't work so well, and you need to be willing and able to take that gamble. I don't think it's a good idea to recommend that to someone just starting out in this game.\n\nSo, were I to do it over again, I would not try to find an inexpensive vintage Gillette right out of the gate. Instead, I'd buy a Maggard V3A head, or perhaps a Slant head, with an MR14 handle. I have both of these heads and combined with this handle they're actually two of my favorite razors. Both have great blade feel and just work wonderfully for an extremely low price ($20.95 and $29.95, respectively, at the time of this writing). Not exactly bank breaking, these guys. Alternatively, I'd go with a nickel-plated Fatip Grande, which also has beautiful blade feel for a low, low price ($23.60 at the time of this writing), and includes the added advantage of being made from brass rather than a plated zinc composite (thus being more robust and naturally long-lived).\n\nAny of those 3 would give me exactly what I *want* from a razor: Lots of blade feel and an immediate opportunity to learn all about the benefits reaped by using too much pressure.\n\n-----\nPrevious | Next\n:-|-:\n[Chapter 9:Vintage](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/9653lq/friday_austere_august_sotd_thread_aug_10_2018/e3zsign/)|[Chapter 11: Even More Vintagier](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/96nrkr/sunday_austere_august_sotd_thread_aug_12_2018/e42pfp2)",

True to Jimmy Buffett, it is island music but the build between it and lyrics is just perfect. Jimmy has some ridiculous songs but the guy is really one hell of a song writer and there is soul there in this music. Not the same kind of soul that you'd find in a Jazz bar but one you'd find on a beach, a little tipsy from the rum and the women. Sand in his hair, the sun going down, barefoot, sunglasses on. That's what I think of when I listen to Jimmy Buffett. That and my father. Dad always likes some Jimmy when he BBQ's.\n\n12 days in a row and my face is starting to feel it. Little raw today. Maybe I got a little *too* close yesterday. I don't blame the GSB.\n",

Getting closer!\n\n**Razor and Blade Notes**\nBetter cut than yesterday. Guess my technique was on point. No stinging from AS, so that confirms it. Nacet and Dart working well together still!\n\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Few hairs are showing some tip length (with most being cut flush)\n\n**Soap Notes**\nGood lather, but I want it richer!\n\nBloomed soap for 20 mins, 30 sec load with barely damp brush, then ended up adding to a total of 1.5 tsp water. When I put it on my face, it started to be a little too thick, and I ended up adding 0.5 tsp water. Next time, I'm going to add 2 tsp to the lather instead of 1.5. I've added 2tsp before, but it must have been with other variables being different. Also focused on stirring a little more slowly.\n\nScent strength\nDay 1-2: 3-4/10\nDay 4-5: 2-3/10\nDay 6-7: 2/10\nDay 8-10: 1/10\nDay 11: 0/10 (can't smell it any more while lathering)\n\nSlick as usual and very protective!\n\n**Brush Notes**\nenjoyable, and comfortable. holds enough lather for 2 passes nicely.\n\n----\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger**\n\nUse this to document how long our blades last for this month, and what about them made us pitch 'em. I created a Google Form with just a few questions, if anyone is interested:\n\n[Ending of Blades Ledger](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform)\n\nI'll keep this as my footer each day so you have the link.

I've also heard that at they have a group of actors that board the train and stage an old west robbery, during the trip.\n\nMy oldest is at the age where he's obsessed with \"good guys vs bad guys\" a la the Saturday morning cartoons he loves so much. So, if they do in fact pull this robbery, his little brain will melt right out of his little ears.\n\n\nHave a good Sunday ya'll.",

So...something positive! Back in June, My buddy announced that he was getting married this month. He let me know that im going to be a groomsman. I made it a mission to get into better shape.\n\nI did Keto for about a month and a half. But being in a Mexican family, everything we eat has Carbs, and is a staple in our family diet. So I gave up on it, it was tpo restrictive. Instead what I did was picked up intermittent fasting. Im on a 16/8 schedule (fast for 16 hours, 8 hour eating window). Since the beginning of June I went from being 210 to 190, and I dropped 2 waste sizes. I haven't worn size 32 jeans high school.\n\nThe wedding is next week, and I am happy as a clam.",

I thought, *This would be the perfect thing to keep my Williams in since it doesn't come with any kind of container.*\n\nI was also interested in whether this old-ass brush would work.\n\nTurns out, it was about twice the brush that my Edwin Jagger Best was. It had more backbone, softer tips, and a more comfortable handle. It was also a larger knot, and held more soap.\n\nThis kind of blew my mind, because from the little research I was able to do before getting started in this, I had been led to believe that boar brushes are inherently inferior to badgers. Never believe anything you read on the internet.\n\nExcept for this. I wouldn't steer you wrong.\n\nMy EJ Best wasn't a bad brush by any means, especially for its time. Does it compare to a Declaration brush? Heck no. But it was a serviceable brush for many years. That said, it also doesn't compare to any of my Zenith brushes. Its being a badger has nothing to do with that. It's simply one brush among many, which exhibits certain characteristics.\n\nAnyway, I liked the boar brush much more than the EJ Best, which leads me to the next kit substitution I'd make it I were doing it today: Instead of the EJ Best, I'd buy a Zenith boar. My B03-A26 is maybe the 2nd least expensive brush I own, and it's also one of the best. The EJ Best cost like 5x what I paid for the Zenith, and the Zenith is like 5x the brush that the EJ is.\n\nIf that had been my first brush, I could well have lived without ever wanting another. But I know that I wouldn't have.\n\n-----\nPrevious | Next\n:-|-:\n[Chapter 10: Mulligan](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/96f288/saturday_austere_august_sotd_thread_aug_11_2018/e41nxiw/)|[Chapter 12: Blade 2: Exploration Boogalo](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/96wjm6/monday_austere_august_sotd_thread_aug_13_2018/e45ppea/)",

I proceeded to cut off a nice little chunk of my beard! Thankfully, it's not noticeable to anyone but myself, but that hurt my heart. I'm glad my facial hair grows as fast as it does.

This morning's shave was great though, I used the lightest pressure and got a very smooth irritation free shave. It's funny, knowing I would be likely shaving tonight, I tried to shave halfheartedly to leave a little something for later, and I ended up with just as efficient of a shave. I think because I'm so used to light/aluminum razors, I forgot how to properly use a solid SS razor and wanted to help it a little bit. Also, I light the scent of this a lot better in the mornings than I do in the evenings.",

This may be **the one**!\n\nThough the Nacet is starting to leave more hairs behind.\n\n**Razor and Blade Notes**\nblade left some more hairs not cut all that well. new level of quality degradation, I guess. comfortable shave with no irritation, though. Razor continues to be a stable daily driver as long as I watch my angles.\n\nI'm not able to go ATG in the neck area, for irritation reasons. So if you're able to, you can get better results out of a 15 day Nacet, I'll bet.\n\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Many hairs show whisker tips with a little length to them\n\n**Soap Notes**\n**I think I've arrived!**\n\nBloomed soap (cool water) for 26 mins, 30 sec load with barely damp brush, then ended up adding to a total of 2 tsp water. Looked more like other soaps this time as it became more elastic and hydrated. Had a little cushion, bubbles were very minimal, and was well-slick. Very enjoyable. I think if I try to get it more luxurious, it will be too dry and won't bond with the skin as well.\n\nI think next I might do the same lather with my non-ridged bowl to see if there is any difference.\n\nAnd I'm not saying you have to bloom the soap for that long. That's just the way it ended up to be. I'll shorten that time in the future to find where the sweet spot is.\n\nScent strength\nDay 1-2: 3-4/10\nDay 4-5: 2-3/10\nDay 6-7: 2/10\nDay 8-10: 1/10\nDay 11: 0/10 (can't smell it any more while lathering)\n\n\n----\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger**\n\nUse this to document how long our blades last for this month, and what about them made us pitch 'em. I created a Google Form with just a few questions, if anyone is interested:\n\n[Ending of Blades Ledger](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform)\n\nI'll keep this as my footer each day so you have the link. I'll take it down if no one shows interest.",

No complaints about the soap or shave, the brush still feels a tad floppy for my like but I really do like the ultra soft tips and I am getting decent face lathers out of it, so it is working as intended. I still like this scent.",

In my opinion, the problem with a lot of the advice you get from people is that they're repeating bad advice that they got from people who got bad advice from people who got good advice from people who knew what they were about, how to go about it, and why. It's the telephone game at work.\n\nOne aspect of this that seems like it's actually a bit underrepresented is blade exploration. I always felt that this was a bit of a shame because there's as large a variance in blades as there is in razors, brushes, soaps, creams, etc.\n\nI've read and discussed with a handful of folks in the hobby different potential methods of blade exploration over the past few years. I've pretty much tried them all, from the extended tours that could stretch into months if not years worth of exploration, to artificially imposed limitations on the number of shaves you do before switching to a new blade, to pretty much everything in between. Most of them seem to make little sense to me, because they're all focused on the shaver working in order to suit the blade, and not vice versa. The entire point of there being eleventy billion different blade brands out there is that you can find the right blade for you, not the right you for the blade.\n\nWhen I started in this game, my first razor came with a small variety pack of blades. I did exploration by using all of those blades. Of the six different ones I had, I liked Feathers the most. Problem is, Feathers were more expensive than the ones I found at my pharmacy, so I ended up sticking with those.\n\nOver the years I eventually found my way back to Feathers, and I also developed my own technique for exploration. I thought it might be useful to share it, so here goes:\n\n1. Get some kind of blade sample pack. I'm personally a fan of the ones offered by Try a Blade, because you can buy them in any quantity you want. I find 3 to be the sweet spot for this.\n\n1. Once you have your blades, choose a brand to start with. It does not matter which one, so just pick one instead of over-analyzing them.\n\n1. Shave with that blade. If it doesn't provide you a reasonably comfortable shave, then toss it. It may be a dud. Signs of dud blades are not shaving at all, or being super tuggy right out of the gate. **NOT** cutting yourself; that's on you. Same with razor burn (under most circumstances): you need to work on improving your technique in these cases.\n\n1. If you tossed the blade, grab another from the same brand and try that. If it's the same thing, toss that one too and move onto another brand. Chances are this blade just isn't right for you. If it's better, then go to the next step.\n\n1. If your blade is giving you an acceptable shave, then keep using it until it no longer gives you an acceptable shave. Once you reach this point, toss it and move onto the next brand. Return to step 3 and continue from there. Do this for all of the brands in your sampler. Once you've done that, the blade that feels best to you is the winner. Buy them in bulk, like /u/Old_Hiker and I do.\n\n1. ???\n\n1. Profit.\n\nFeel free to do renewed exploration from time to time. Maybe there's a blade that you've always wanted to try because the package looks cool, or maybe you've seen people rave about how much sharper it is than other brands online (do not listen to this stuff; it's dreck). Also feel free to find what you enjoy and settle into a groove. Both are valid.\n\nAlso, hold onto those extras that you probably have left over. After a while, once you've honed your technique sufficiently, go back and retry them. You might find that, with improved technique, a blade that wasn't great before is a lot better than you remember.\n\nAlso, also, don't feel bad if a blade that other people like simply isn't for you. These things are not a popularity contest. The end goal is to get a good shave.\n\n\n-----\nPrevious | Next\n:-|-:\n[Chapter 11: Even More Vintagier](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/96nrkr/sunday_austere_august_sotd_thread_aug_12_2018/e42pfp2)|[Chapter 13: The Carts Are Alright](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/976k94/tuesday_austere_august_sotd_thread_aug_14_2018/e47zmd2/)",

We're almost halfway through the month, so maybe it'll get better but damn. I honestly wasn't sure if I was gonna make it through today. It felt like it scraped my face the entire time but didn't really want to cut any hairs. Today was not the day to shave before I had any coffee, that's for sure.

While I don't think this blade is a good match, I also think the razor is not for me. Almost half way through and I'm finally over kicking myself for not jumping on a Ti BBS-1 when given the chance because it \"wasn't in the budget.\" I just don't see it as being that different from the regular WR1. There's a chance it's more efficient, but there's still more blade feel than I expected. With the WR1, I actually like the level of blade feel as I'm able to feel it and kind of ride the edge through the shave.",

This week I've noticed the brush feels softer, less scratchy(still plenty of scrub, which I like) and might even be lathering better. This hog took its sweet ass time, but after like, two months of near daily use I think it's finally reaching its final form.\n\nAlso fuck work.",

But blade actually shaved better than yesterday.\n\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Few hairs are showing some tip length (with most being cut flush)\n\n**Soap Notes**\nNow trying Face Lathering!\n\nBloomed soap (cool water) with just a little water for 20 mins or so, 60 sec load with barely damp brush while leaving bloom water in. Will have to reduce water some, because the lather was getting tossed off the brush and onto my shirt often. First pass was thinner than in the past, but 2 and 3 were nice, with me having to reload a bit of lather from the puck for the 3rd. Very enjoyable.\n\nNow the slickness was something ... just nuts. The lather didn't have as much cushion as in the past, but the slickness was off the charts. So much that it took a while of rinsing between passes to bring it down. I guess all that water and loading in the mug brought it out. No drag on the razor today!\n\nI think next I will just reduce the amount of water.\n\nAnd I'm not saying you have to bloom the soap for that long. That's just the way it ended up to be. I'll shorten that time in the future to find where the sweet spot is.\n\nScent strength\nDay 1-2: 3-4/10\nDay 4-5: 2-3/10\nDay 6-7: 2/10\nDay 8-10: 1/10\nDay 11: 0/10 (can't smell it any more while lathering)\n\nBest Lathers:\n\n* Bloomed soap (cool water) for 26 mins, 30 sec load with barely damp brush, then ended up adding to a total of 2 tsp water. Looked more like other soaps this time as it became more elastic and hydrated. Had a little cushion, bubbles were very minimal, and was well-slick.\n\n\n**Brush Notes**\nBrush did well with face-lathering, though it did not hold enough for 3 passes.\n\n----\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger**\n\nUse this to document how long our blades last for this month, and what about them made us pitch 'em. I created a Google Form with just a few questions, if anyone is interested:\n\n[Ending of Blades Ledger](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform)\n\nI'll keep this as my footer each day so you have the link. I'll take it down if no one shows interest.",

That's it, put down your pitchforks. Come in, have a seat. There we are. May I offer you a glass of Ovaltine?\n\nOK, on with it. When I started wet shaving, it was for purely budgetary reasons. I was broke, and after a small initial investment it was a very economical way to shave. Before I got into this crazy hobby, I was simply a dude who chose to shave with old timey gear and this weird soap that looked like it belonged in a shower more than in a mug.\n\nBut even before that, I shaved for years with a cartridge razor and a can of foamin' goo. And I'll tell you right now, when the top popped open there was nothin' my kit wouldn't do.\n\nWhen I was 13, I learned how to shave with that canned foam and that Gillette Sensor Excel. And sure, I gave myself a few nicks at first. But once I got the hang of it, I used that kit forever and a day. At some point I upgraded to a Gillette Fusion and swapped out the Colgate foam that my dad used for Edge Gel. In all those years, I never got a bad shave. I can remember exactly one ingrown hair.\n\n*And boy did that suck: I ended up having to cut it out of my chin with an x-acto knife. I think you can still see the scar.*\n\nBut in nearly 15 years, I never got a bad shave out of any of those razors. If it hadn't been for my financial situation at the time, I never would have bothered to make the switch to traditional wet shaving. That would have been my loss, but that's a discussion for another time.\n\nSince the time that the (now) old school wet shaving-focused web forums started cropping up I've read enough horror stories about hacked up faces and ingrown hairs at the hands of demon-possessed cartridge razors to be able to compile the script to *Maximum Overdrive 2: Electric Boogaloo.*\n\n*It's actually gonna be pretty great; I'm almost done with it. I play an older, fatter, yet well-groomed Bill Robinson, and there's a scene where a Slap Chop comes to life and eats [this motherfucker's face](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UWRyj5cHIQA) right off.*\n\nAt this point, I feel as though I've strayed pretty far from anything remotely resembling a topic, and you're likely staring in disbelief and asking yourself, *Now what kind of a guru are you, anyway?*\n\nNot any kind, really, so don't you waste your time on me.\n\nI read a lot of stories about people who switched to DEs because they got horrible shaves from carts, and it took me quite a while to figure out why that would be. It actually dawned on me one day while I was watching television. I noticed one day that literally every commercial or television show that I saw, in which someone was shaving with a cart, depicted ridiculously poor technique. If people are watching this shit, of course they're picking up bad habits. All of these poor guys are getting terrible shaves from carts because they don't know how to use them properly.\n\nThe thing that the pros don't tell you (and that nobody wants to admit) is that carts work well if you know how to use them. There's a trick to finding the correct blade angle with a cartridge razor. The trick is to not expect the pivot to do the work: You make the pivot work for you. As you touch the razor to your face, kick the handle all the way outward until it's nearly perpendicular to the head (sort of like any other safety razor, go figure), and then shave with it in that position. This allows the head to stand away slightly and line the blade edges up to cut efficiently. This allows you to guide the razor to the proper angle. It also makes the pivot make minor adjustments to the curves of your face rather than just rattling around on top of your skin. That tiny change in grip, and the cart works just fine.\n\nThey're still stupid expensive though, so fuck them; I'm sticking with a DE. Or SE. Or Injector. Or straight. Just not a cart. I hate those things as much as anyone.\n\nHope you enjoyed your Ovaltine. Now get outta my house.\n\n-----\nPrevious | Next\n:-|-:\n[Chapter 12: Blade 2: Exploration Boogalo](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/96wjm6/monday_austere_august_sotd_thread_aug_13_2018/e45ppea/)|[Chapter 14: Return](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/97gjgm/wednesday_austere_august_sotd_thread_aug_15_2018/e49xn1q/)",

I really like this set up, but I'm looking forward to switching it up again, using some other stuff. I feel like a parent neglecting the second child because his firstborn is just so damn great, and let's be honest, the second kid hasn't turned out as great as the first, and the strain of another kid is really weighing on your marriage, and you sometimes catch yourself daydreaming about when it was one kid, and your wife still loved you and made an effort, although you're positive she's having an affair with Brad from the office, you're just not sure you care enough to say anything about it. So you just kind of coast, autopilot through your job, your life at home taking care of the kids, in a kind of constant stupor that's only broken when you get a rare chance to work on your woodcarvings in the garage, but even then you know it's just a temporary relief, and soon enough you'll have to go back into the house to put the kids to bed and come back to reality.\n\nYeah, good soap though.\nP.S. ^^fuck ^^work",

I had to put the Seville Reserve somewhere I can't see it everyday because I really want to give that a go. Not the best shave today. I had two days of growth and it felt a little rough.",

I'm going to experiment and see if I can push the blade through a few more shaves. I'm thinking it may not make it to the end of the month. I'm usually used to swapping blades out every 4-6 shaves depending on the blade. That's usually when things start to get a little tuggy. But I'm wondering if it might be an issue with my skin right now. A couple of pimples showed up on my chin earlier this week, so maybe it's that...

Or still halfway to go? When you're standing in the middle of the tunnel, the lights at both ends are equally far away. At least one way is out. They can't *both* be the lights of the oncoming trains. And besides, if they are both oncoming trains, you will be a pretty insignificant \"also ran\" in the devastation and destruction story of two trains colliding inside a tunnel.\n\nSo there's that.\n\nI'm off to court this morning. I'm testifying in a Homicide trial. Last year my partner and I responded to a pretty horrific beating scene. After a bit of work, we located and ended up catching the suspect who was still nearby. I can't share much more until the trial is over.\n\nWhat's amazing to me is thst early in my career, I figured catching a Homicide suspect would be a once or twice in a career occurrence. Especially catching them *right after* the incident. But thst was the second one, *just that year*.\n\nLife is funny sometimes. Happy Wednesday everyone.\n\nDay 15. Shave 15.

Used less bloom water, so had to add h20 to my brush as I built the lather on my face, as is sometimes typical. But lathering with this brush was enjoyable.\n\n**Razor and Blade Notes**\nNot slowing down! The last two shaves have been better than the previous 2! Not cutting as close as uses 1-7ish, but c'mon, the results are still **above average** for me. Looking like this blade will go the distance.\n\nA tiny bit of **irritation** when shaving, but it would disappear after the razor had passed. Face felt great at the end, even before I put on the Afta.\n\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Few hairs are showing some tip length (with most being cut flush)\n\n**Soap Notes**\nFace-lathering today. Bloomed soap (cool water) with 1 tsp water for 20 mins or so, 60 sec load with barely-damp brush. Funny thing is that after blooming, the soap had **absorbed** all the 1 tsp of water! Good to know.\n\nThis gave me enough soap to go all three passes. Lather was a bit thin, but had the same crazy slickness as yesterday. I did have to add water to the brush as the soap thickened up on my face.\n\nI think next I will bump up the bloom water to 1.5 or 2 tsp. It may have been all kinds of messy, but I liked the lather from yesterday better. I don't enjoy having to keep adding water to a brush and trying to manage all the excess suds on my face on the first pass while I build the lather.\n\nAnd I'm not saying you have to bloom the soap for that long. That's just the way it ended up to be. I'll shorten that time in the future to find where the sweet spot is.\n\nScent strength\nDay 1-2: 3-4/10\nDay 4-5: 2-3/10\nDay 6-7: 2/10\nDay 8-10: 1/10\nDay 11: 0/10 (can't smell it any more while lathering)\n\n----\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger**\n\nUse this to document how long our blades last for this month, and what about them made us pitch 'em. I created a Google Form with just a few questions, if anyone is interested:\n\n[Ending of Blades Ledger](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform)\n\nI'll keep this as my footer each day so you have the link. I'll take it down if no one shows interest.\n",

I have a feeling that it's because this blade has smoothed out.\n\nI did a check of the gaps with my feeler guages and they're correct and obviously a larger gap on 9 as compared to 7, so I'm guessing it has to be the blade. The blade itself is still going strong. No tugging, no roughness, just smooth goodness.\n\nThe worst part about AA continues to just be the lack of variety when it comes to scents. I've said it several times this month but Resolute is great. I just want something to mix it up every now and then.\n\nImma stick to it though, we're halfway there right?",

The meringue less so than the other two; it just takes a shitload of time and energy. But especially the hollandaise and the mayonnaise. Both of those are processes that require a lot of time, patience, attentiveness and overall babying.\n\nHollandaise will just completely break if you don't whisk it fast enough over exactly the right amount of heat for exactly the right amount of time, and *BOOM* there goes your emulsion. Welcome to your saucepan of scrambled eggs and lemon juice. Mayonnaise will simply never enter an emulsion if you don't drizzle oil into your eggs at exactly the correct rate, and get that shit spinning quickly enough to emulsify. And then you have a bowl full of oil and scrambled eggs that aren't actually cooked. A meringue, if you can't whip it hard enough for the right amount of time will just refuse to get out of soft peaks and then you're left with a bowl full of delicious not-quite-marshmallow-fluff that isn't what you need to top a pie.\n\nThese 3 food items have a lot in common in that they all involve similar processing: whipping the bejeezus out of some ingredients in a very specific manner over a very narrow success window. They all require a large amount of effort and no small amount of understanding about how their problem domains operate in order to achieve success. Some also require a large investment of time. Another commonality among them is that, if you're able to make them, and make them well, they provide a great sense of accomplishment along with a delicious end product. They invariably taste light years better than their store-bought equivalents.\n\nWilliams Mug Soap actually shares a lot in common with hollandaise, mayonnaise, and meringue. It is hands down the fussiest soap I've ever used in my life. It wants to be loaded in a specific manner or else it won't aerate properly during the lather. It requires you to add water with a friggin' syringe or else it'll just break and turn into soap bubbles. If you attack it too quickly or push the water/product balance in the opposite direction, it turns into an actual meringue and dries on your face like a fucking mud mask (ask me how I know this). If you load it with too wet a brush, you're shaving with soapy water that morning. If you load it with too dry a brush, It simply won't load enough product and then you can't add water to it.\n\nSome folks might say, */u/airbornesimian, why don't you just bloom your Williams? That'll make it load more easily,* and I say get the fuck outta my house with that blooming shit. Load your soap like a man.\n\nI have a confession to make: Once upon a time, I was a bowl latherer. With an actual bowl, in fact: It was a Corelle Vitrelle fruit bowl that I bought at Wal-Mart for like $1 USD. Told you I was broke back in the day. It was actually a super serviceable lather bowl for a lot of years. I still have it, in fact.\n\nI'm mentioning this now because bowl lathering is basically the only way to get Williams to lather properly. And there's the rub: One *can* lather Williams properly. With the right amount of time and effort (both high), Williams can produce a serviceable lather. I would never call it anything else. Serviceable; yep. It has slickness and lacks every other quality one looks for in a shaving soap.\n\nBut at least it's not Col. Conk, amirite /u/urfrendlipiro? Eh? Eh? Wink-wink! Nudge-nudge!\n\nBut yes, with enough time and effort, you can bend Williams into a serviceable lather. And this is where any commonalities between Williams and hollandaise, mayonnaise, meringue end. Because once you've done that, you don't feel accomplished. You feel like WTF is this shit so hard for? And you're not left with an excellent end product. You have shaving soap that is 1/4 of what shaving soap needs to be. You feel wronged, somehow. Ripped off. Grifted by this \"lasting lather\" bullshit on the Williams box. There's no return on your investment here. You've given Williams your all and it responds with, \"KWEH?\" It doesn't even smell good, fercrissakes.\n\nBut it gets the job done. I kept going back to it because it was inexpensive and because I already knew how to lather it, so that stuff didn't really register with me. I will say that I suspect it gave me soap lathering superpowers. To this day if you hand me a tub of soap I'll figure it out within 2 lathers at the outside. So maybe that was worthwhile, after all.\n\nAlso it was my kind of soap in those days. Not the soap I needed, but the one I deserved; that's Williams.\n\n\n-----\nPrevious | Next\n:-|-:\n[Chapter 13: The Carts Are Alright](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/976k94/tuesday_austere_august_sotd_thread_aug_14_2018/e47zmd2/)|[Chapter 15: Bodhicitta](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/97qg0s/thursday_austere_august_sotd_thread_aug_16_2018/e4c9dry/)",

So glad I picked this scent, I'm not even a little tired of it. I think I noticed lately that while some of it has been organic from being around longer, I think doing something like this has gone some way to curb my FOMO. This is the most 'valuable' DE I'm aware of other than the titanium variant. The soap is a one off that I don't think will ever come back again. Why's that matter? Because after 16 days of using the same thing, it's made me realize how much I *still* wanna my other stuff. I miss my alumigoose and straights. I miss all my other scents, and almost more the bases. This brush though, this thing is the truth and while I do want to use my other batches for variety's sake, I'm completely content with it.",

Because there's something manly about pulling a blade across your face and ending up looking good. Masculinity has seemed to fall out of fashion over the last decade or so. It's nice to have an outward manifestation of the inward manliness that many of us still value.\n\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Very Close Shave\n*Neck*: Few hairs are showing some tip length (with most being cut flush)\n\n**Soap Notes**\nFirst pass too thin. 2nd and 3rd were very creamy and nice!\n\nFor today's face-lather, I bloomed soap (cool water) with 2 tsp water for 20 mins or so, 60 sec load with barely-damp brush. This gave me enough soap to go all three passes. Lather was a bit thin on the first pass, and a little airy, but was doable, though I didn't like it. However, the 2nd and third passes were a slick, creamy lather. had the same crazy slickness as yesterday. Were it not for the overly-thin first pass, this one would be a mix to bookmark.\n\nI think next I will just bloom for less time, just to see what happens. Tried to today, but video difficulties gave me delays. I don't actually know what to do to fix this situation. The 2nd and 3rd passes were so perfect, I feel like anything I do to try to fix the airy and thinness of the 1st pass will mess them up.\n\nAnd I'm not saying you have to bloom the soap for that long. That's just the way it ended up to be. I'll shorten that time in the future to find where the sweet spot is.\n\nScent strength\nDay 1-2: 3-4/10\nDay 4-5: 2-3/10\nDay 6-7: 2/10\nDay 8-10: 1/10\nDay 11: 0/10 (can't smell it any more while lathering)\n\n----\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger**\n\nUse this to document how long our blades last for this month, and what about them made us pitch 'em. I created a Google Form with just a few questions, if anyone is interested:\n\n[Ending of Blades Ledger](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform)\n\nI'll keep this as my footer each day so you have the link. I'll take it down if no one shows interest.",

[This nirvana](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTjYPmZ3FQA).\n\nI looked back over the year, this evening. I started out in about the same position I'd been in the previous year, working through soap samples and playing with new gear. My love for injectors and vintage DEs was already firmly entrenched by that point.\n\nAs the year progressed, I explored brushes a ton more, the culmination of which was definitely [Kerafyrm here](https://imgur.com/U0jJqoj).\n\nI did the March Madness thing, which was hella fun but a little nerve-wracking because it required me to commit to shaving every day and writing about it, not to mention using a slew of untested (by me) soaps. While I was trying out those soaps, I really only had 3 bad lathers in the whole thing, and 2 of those were soaps that I'd already dialed in.\n\nThen I did the lather games, and won that. Then, later, I did the Austere August thing, and there was a less formal bit of a contest involved. I won that, too.\n\nSome other things happened that I could never quite account for. Sometime during the spring, I noticed that I could throw a blade I liked into any razor that I owned or was handed to me and get a great shave out of it. I haven't cut myself in I can't tell you how long. If my SOTD posts are to be believed, it's been since mid-2016. By the end of the year I could throw any blade into any razor and figure out how to get an irritation-free bbs from it inside of one shave. I took two blades to the century club last year. I have a near-encyclopedic knowledge of vintage injectors at this point.\n\nAny soap that I've used in the past two years, I've dialed in completely within two lathers at most. I basically can't tell the difference between soap bases anymore. I chat with folks a lot about soaps, and I've read a ton about this tier or that tier, and which performs better than what, and I dunno...nearly every soap I own performs excellently, I get literally no irritation and nothing but a happy face from any of them. I feel as though I may be able to do that with any soap at all.\n\nExcept perhaps /u/Old_Hiker's 100-year-old ash cake soap. But I'd give it a shot!\n\nI started to draw these conclusions late last year. The WKDM base had come out, and the B&M Reserve base, and of course Icarus. They're all excellent soap bases, and those guys put a ton of effort into making the best soap they can, and should all be applauded and showered with our money for their innovations. But I can get as good a shave out of Cella or Tabac as I can out of those 3 soaps. I still buy them because they're awesome. But top tier vs. middle tier? FOH with that. If I can get the same shave out of Paolo's original base as I can out of Dr. Jon's V2 base, and WKDM, then there's no way I'm discriminating against any of them.\n\nBy the end of last year, I kind of had nowhere else to go. So I, of course, did the only thing left to do: I grew a beard again.\n\n-----\nPrevious | Next\n:-|-:\n[Chapter 14: Return](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/97gjgm/wednesday_austere_august_sotd_thread_aug_15_2018/e49xn1q/)|Chapter 16",

Down my arm, on my chest, onto my foot. Maybe too much water this time. I made the mistake of going to the basement this morning, where I keep my stash of items that I can't touch until I make room. Empire, YRP, GTB, Seville Reserve! I promised myself I would make a significant dent in my supply, so in my head that means 3 soaps. I've got two picked out already, including this Proraso. And then there's a heck ton of samples for me to go through. Then, and only then, will I select something from this exclusive list.\nGood shaves and the like, boys.\n",

Since I don't have much to say today, I decided to look back on last year's journey for the first time. Here is what I wrote last year on this very day of AA:\n\n> I almost broke last night. Like really almost broke. It's not even that I mind the Arko or the smell, I don't at all, but I just really miss my variety and picking scents based on what I'm feeling at the moment - I can't wait to get that back. But I've never quit anything in my life and I'm not gonna start now. Failure's not an option so I have no choice but to forge ahead.\n\nThose were some dark times indeed. In hindsight, I do believe the Arko had already gotten to me and was doing psychological warfare on me. While I'm excited at getting back to my scent variety, I'm in no means suffering with SA and actually quite enjoying its embrace each and every day.",

Today I went back to my scuttle, and it made everything different.\n\nOne annoying thing is that this brush just doesn't play well with the scuttle. It's impossible to build the lather without getting the brush handle soapy, and this handle is so thin that if it's soapy, it requires a pencil-grip of death that makes my hand cramp while lathering my face.\n\nAnother thing I noticed is that even though my water and soap amounts were within acceptable parameters, the lather in the scuttle was _airy as fuck._ I mostly had to build (or beat down?) the lather on my face, anyway, because all I got from the scuttle was this ridiculous megafoam. It seemed significantly thirstier, too, but I can imagine that maybe the heat from the scuttle just dries the lather out faster.\n\nI'm a little baffled by the airiness, though. I can't help but feel like I'm doing something horribly wrong here. ü§î",

Lather too thin, giving a rough shave.\n\n**Razor and Blade Notes**\nblade and razor seem fine, but shave was rough ... probably due to thin lather. However, no irritation after shave.\n\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: A little irritating\n*Neck*: A little irritating\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Very Close Shave\n*Neck*: Few hairs are showing some tip length (with most being cut flush)\n\n**Soap Notes**\nFirst and second pass too thin. 3rd was better.\n\nFor today's face-lather, I bloomed soap (cool water) with 2 tsp water for just a few mins as I prepped for the shave, 60 sec load with barely-damp brush. This gave me enough soap to go all three passes. Lather was thin and airy on the first and second passes, but was doable, though I didn't like it ... was rough. However, the third pass was almost a slick, creamy lather.\n\nBecause I'd like to nail down a good face lather, I think next I will keep the same short bloom (which is more convenient) and load for longer, maybe 90 secs.\n\nScent strength\nDay 1-2: 3-4/10\nDay 4-5: 2-3/10\nDay 6-7: 2/10\nDay 8-10: 1/10\nDay 11-~: 0/10 (can't smell it any more while lathering)\n\nBest Lathers So Far:\n\n* Bloomed soap (cool water) for 26 mins, 30 sec load with barely damp brush, then ended up adding to a total of 2 tsp water. Looked more like other soaps this time as it became more elastic and hydrated. Had a little cushion, bubbles were very minimal, and was well-slick.\n\n\n**Brush Notes**\ntips slow to split, but still comfy while I wait.\n\n----\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger**\n\nUse this to document how long our blades last for this month, and what about them made us pitch 'em. I created a Google Form with just a few questions, if anyone is interested:\n\n[Ending of Blades Ledger](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform)\n\nI'll keep this as my footer each day so you have the link. I'll take it down if no one shows interest.\n",

I'll switch back to the bowl tomorrow and see if the cutting gets closer with the better lather. Cheeks still awesome, though.\n\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Many hairs show whisker tips with a little length to them\n\n**Soap Notes**\nFirst pass thin again. 3rd wasn't too bad. had more soap than last time, since I increased load time to 90 secs.\n\nFor today's face-lather, I bloomed soap (cool water) with 2 tsp water for 10 mins as I prepped for the shave, 90 sec load with barely-damp brush. This gave me enough soap to go all three passes easily. Lather was thin and airy on the first and second passes, but was doable, and a little more pleasant than yesterday. The third pass was okay.\n\nScent strength\nDay 1-2: 3-4/10\nDay 4-5: 2-3/10\nDay 6-7: 2/10\nDay 8-10: 1/10\nDay 11-~: 0/10 (can't smell it any more while lathering)\n\nBest Lathers So Far:\n\n* Bloomed soap (cool water) for 26 mins, 30 sec load with barely damp brush, then ended up adding to a total of 2 tsp water. Looked more like other soaps this time as it became more elastic and hydrated. Had a little cushion, bubbles were very minimal, and was well-slick.\n\n\n----\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger**\n\nUse this to document how long our blades last for this month, and what about them made us pitch 'em. I created a Google Form with just a few questions, if anyone is interested:\n\n[Ending of Blades Ledger](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform)\n\nI'll keep this as my footer each day so you have the link. I'll take it down if no one shows interest.\n",

Well, I literally just loaded, added water, and whipped up a wonderful lather first try. I now know exactly how far to dip this brush in the water to get just enough to get a perfect lather going! It's pretty damn cool that I didn't need to add a single drop of water to it after that. I typically build my lather slowly to make sure I don't overdo it. I just thought that was pretty badass haha. Gotta finish getting ready to work a health fair this morning then I'll come home and change clothes and the wife and I are taking our kids to a little comicon the next town over.

I have zero desire to use Resolute. It's great, but hell even another flavor of Stubble Buster would be welcome right now. Honestly, this is the worst part of AA so far. If you had asked me before it started, then I would've probably told you that using the same blade all month would've been, but really that's going quite well. It's just the redundancy of using the same soap day in and day out. It's making me want to not shave, dreading it a bit bc it's becoming a chore rather than a ritual.\n\nThe blade surprisingly changed up on this shave. I had been getting very, very smooth shaves but today's had much more blade feel. It wasn't unpleasant and it wasn't tugging but it definitely felt sharper than it has for the past 7 shaves or so, which is weird.\n\nIn other news, my mother in law has finally left, so now I can walk around the house naked again.",

I've really come to like this razor *a lot*. It shaves really well.\n\nOff to work day 2 of a professional bike race taking place down town.\n\nYesterday's big winner for dumbest thing I heard all day was from a resident of one of the condos on the race course:\n\nEntitledUrbanLifeYuppie: \"ugh! The entrance to my buildings garage is closed again?!\"\n\nMe: \"Yeah, it's a bike race-\"\n\nEULY: \"Aaagh! This happens like, literally *all. the. time!* Every month it's another marathon, or a race, or a parade, or a baseball game ! Like This is *my home!* All these traffic disruptions are so inconvenient. Does no one ever think about us? The people who live here?\"\n\nMe: \"When did you sign your lease?\"\n\nEULY: \"What? Why does that matt-\"\n\nMe: '\"When did you move in here?\"\n\nEULY: \"Two years ago. Why?\"\n\nMe: \"Well they built that baseball stadium in 1993. And they've been running the marathon on the same weekend for 15 years. And the pride parade comes through the same route every year for the last 20 years. You should have done your research.\"\n\nEULY: \"Yeah but it's inconvenienc-\"\n\nMe: \"You wanted urban living with city culture. Well, here's your culture. They send out plenty of notices about route closures so you know well in advance. Plan better.\"\n\nEULY: \"But this isn't what *I* wanted.\n\nMe: \"Oh yeah? Well guess where this never happens? In the suburbs. Either move or suck it up.\"\n\nCan't wait for 8 more hours of that today.\n\nHappy Sunday ya'll.",

I went to give my razor a wash with dish soap and a toothbrush to get the soap residue off, and so also cleaned the blade. This is the first time I have used a blade enough to need to wash the soap off. I think it made a difference in the shave, but it may be in my head. I decided to revisit this fragrance today, and I still don't really like it. Im going to transfer it to the \"to get rid of\" pile.",

Happy with this new method, though I need to maybe leave more water in the brush. Blade is showing age, but not tugging or irritating.\n\n**Razor and Blade Notes**\nWith such a good lather, it must be that the blade is just no longer able to cut flush my most tricky neck hairs. But at least my irritation is still almost none. Nacet seems to be dying gracefully. If I had a high profile job, I would have had to pitch it a few days ago.\n\nAlso, if you can shave against-the-grain, then you might be fine, and be able to get those tricky hairs like mine.\n\nI'll also say that my cheeks are still getting shaved almost BBS, with no irritation, each time.\n\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Many hairs show whisker tips with a little length to them\n\n**Soap Notes**\nI found a vid online of *Shaving with Rich* (I think) trying 4 methods to lather Williams. He never found a good method, but one of the commenters was \"John L\", who has been shaving with Williams for decades and still comes back to it regularly. Here's his method...\n\n* soak in hot/warm for 5-10 min\n* give your soaked brush about 3 light shakes\n* dump bloom water\n* load heavy from mug\n* move to a bowl and stir till the lather is the way you want it.\n\nSo I tried it. I ended up loading for 1m 45s. A bit of that light, crap lather was overflowing the mug. That's fine with me. The good stuff is back in the brush. I stopped when the lather looked good, but I think it needed more water. I'll try that next time.\n\nOverall, I thought this was an easy way to get to a good lather. Fairly simple and intuitive. At the end, the lather in the bowl was too airy, but the brush is what had the good stuff. It seems that, in the bowl, once the airy lather surrounds the brush, it doesn't let the soap come out of the brush. As a user, if you feel that light lather, you don't know whether you need to add more water to help the brush-soap come out, or if you're at the verge of having too much water in your lather, and there's none in the brush that's waiting.\n\nScent strength\nDay 1-2: 3-4/10\nDay 4-5: 2-3/10\nDay 6-7: 2/10\nDay 8-10: 1/10\nDay 11-~: 0/10 (can't smell it any more while lathering)\n\nBest Lathers So Far:\n\n* Bloomed soap (cool water) for 26 mins, 30 sec load with barely damp brush, then ended up adding to a total of 2 tsp water. Looked more like other soaps this time as it became more elastic and hydrated. Had a little cushion, bubbles were very minimal, and was well-slick.\n\n----\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger**\n\nUse this to document how long our blades last for this month, and what about them made us pitch 'em. I created a Google Form with just a few questions, if anyone is interested:\n\n[Ending of Blades Ledger](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform)\n\nI'll keep this as my footer each day so you have the link. I'll take it down if no one shows interest.\n",

I thought while I was at it, I would take my brush to some Red Panda Grooming brush cleaner. Nice, clean gear for today. Went into it thinking I only needed an ATG pass, but soon into the shave I ended up still feeling stubble, and the pass was uncomfortable (blade probably). So I doubled back with my XTG pass and felt smooth, so I ended up just doing a quick 1-2 pass per section without re-lathering. 120 seconds lather, 180 seconds shave, 210 seconds cleanup/post-shave. 8.5 minutes total.\nGood shaves and the like, boys.\n",

Must've been some thin lathers (when I was trying to nail down a face lather) and maybe off technique, but the shave on my trouble spot area is really nice this time.\n\nthe first pass was a tiny bit more rough than in the past, but pass 2 and 3 were great as usual.\n\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: A little irritating\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Few hairs are showing some tip length (with most being cut flush)\n\n**Soap Notes**\nI am working on a generalized method gotten from John L (see yesterday) and tweaked yesterday's mix, giving me a better lather. I can reduce loading time, though. Here's today's...\n\n* soak in hot/warm for 20 min (inadvertent)\n* give your soaked brush about 0 light shakes (eliminated shakes because he is using badger and I'll bet my boar holds less water)\n* dump bloom water\n* load heavy from mug, 1m 40s (was too long, probably due to excessive soak)\n* move to a bowl and stir till the lather is the way you want it. I did end up adding 1tsp more of water, which really helped.\n\nToo much lather, but it was good stuff. Yesterday, what was left in the bowl was too airy and dissipated by end of shave. Not so today. Now to start reducing the load time ... and the other elements, to compensate.\n\nOverall, I thought this was an easy way to get to a good lather. Fairly simple and intuitive.\n\nScent strength\nDay 1-2: 3-4/10\nDay 4-5: 2-3/10\nDay 6-7: 2/10\nDay 8-~: 1/10\n\nBest Lathers So Far:\n\n* Bloomed soap (cool water) for 26 mins, 30 sec load with barely damp brush, then ended up adding to a total of 2 tsp water. Looked more like other soaps this time as it became more elastic and hydrated. Had a little cushion, bubbles were very minimal, and was well-slick.\n\n----\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger**\n\nUse this to document how long our blades last for this month, and what about them made us pitch 'em. I created a Google Form with just a few questions, if anyone is interested:\n\n[Ending of Blades Ledger](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform)\n\nI'll keep this as my footer each day so you have the link. I'll take it down if no one shows interest.\n",

I'm guessing since I loaded for the same amount of swirls as my last several shaves, maybe my brush was too wet. 2.5 minutes lather, 2 minutes first pass, 2.5 minutes final pass, 3.5 minutes clean/post. 10.5 minutes total\nGood shaves and the like, boys.\n",

I've got the Dr. Jon's soap base dialed in so my lather is great quality and slick as all get out. And, I'll be darned if Flowers in the Dark is not still one of the best smelling lavender soaps on the market. I really hope they make it a permanent offering. Or, at least, keep bringing it back seasonally every year.\nAfter 21 shaves (actually quite a bit before) the blade sucks. It is going to feel so nice putting in a nice, new blade into that razor (maybe even shaving with a different razor!). But, at 21 days in, I've only got 10 shaves to go to successfully complete Ultra Nightmare Mode, and it just sounds so cool I'm going to keep going for it.\nHappy shaves, everyone!",

Just still too much of the suds. And the blade is still working **really** well.\n\n**Razor and Blade Notes**\nBlade is shaving like it's the eighth shave. Very nice. Good results. My neck can tell it's not quite as smooth as it once was, but still good enough.\n\nMy cheek results are actually the best of the whole month! 98% BBS without going against-the-grain.\n\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Few hairs are showing some tip length (with most being cut flush)\n\n**Soap Notes**\nToday's lather with Williams was wonderful. Cushion, elasticity, and superb slickness.\n\nI am working on a generalized method gotten from John L (see 2 days ago) and tweaked yesterday's mix, giving me a better lather. I can still reduce loading time, though. Here's today's...\n\n* soak in hot/warm for 7 min\n* give your soaked brush about 0 light shakes (eliminated shakes because he is using badger and I'll bet my boar holds less water)\n* bloom water: I used it as a pre-shave rinse\n* load heavy from mug, 1m (was still too long, probably due to excessive soak)\n* move to a bowl and stir till the lather is the way you want it. I did end up adding 2.5 tsp more of water, which really helped.\n\nToo much lather, but it was even better than yesterday's. Maybe reduce load time to 30-40 secs.\n\nOverall, I thought this was an easy way to get to a good lather. Fairly simple and intuitive.\n\nScent strength\nDay 1-2: 3-4/10\nDay 4-5: 2-3/10\nDay 6-7: 2/10\nDay 8-~: 1/10\n\nBest Lathers So Far:\n\n* Bloomed soap (cool water) for 26 mins, 30 sec load with barely damp brush, then ended up adding to a total of 2 tsp water. Looked more like other soaps this time as it became more elastic and hydrated. Had a little cushion, bubbles were very minimal, and was well-slick.\n\n----\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger**\n\nUse this to document how long our blades last for this month, and what about them made us pitch 'em. I created a Google Form with just a few questions, if anyone is interested:\n\n[Ending of Blades Ledger](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform)\n\nI'll keep this as my footer each day so you have the link. I'll take it down if no one shows interest.\n",

The worst part about AA has been the lack of excitement that developed after shave 4 or 5 or so. This morning, I seemed to have some of that excitement back.\n\nThis blade is certainly going through some kind of something. It started out feeling as my Perma Sharp's normally do. Sharp, plenty smooth, and just a touch of blade feel. Then it got really smooth, now for the past 2 shaves it's feeling harsher than even if it were fresh out of the wrapper. Harsh probably isn't the best word, it's not tugging or pulling, it just seems like there's more blade feel now than ever. Of course, I've changed the settings over time for the Fatboy/Executive hybrid I'm using but a few shaves ago this thing was buttery smooth on setting 9. Now, I'm using it on setting 7 and getting those results. Tis weird, man.",

This has impacted my post quality during Austere August. Sorry.\n\nIn the meantime, here's something to think about:\n\nI'm sure most of you have seen Pixar's hit movies, *Cars*. Those of you with kids probably know they made a spin-off called [Planes](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1691917/).\n\nThe premise: a plucky crop-dusting prop-plane lives out his dream of racing in an international around-the-world airplane race. His reluctant coach is Skipper Riley, a crack pilot and leader of the Jolly Wrenches Squadron that fought in WWII.\n\nWhy is this interesting? Well, now that Cars/Planes has acknowledged that WWII happened in their world, we have a lot of new possibilities and questions:\n\nClearly there was a Cars Hitler, a Cars holocaust, a Cars Pacific War, a Cars D-Day, a Cars nuking of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, a Cars Rape of Nanking, a Cars Battle of Iwo Jima...\n\nThis leads to so many important questions, like: were the Cars Little Boy and Fat Man nukes sentient? Was it a suicide mission? Are ALL Cars nuclear weapons sentient? Do they know they're going to die? Did Tsar Bomba have a personality? What kind of car was Car Hitler? (Probably a Mercedes 540K). What kind of car was Churchill (Triumph maybe)? And Truman? Did the US round up all of the Hondas, and Toyotas in the US and put force them into camps? What did the counter-culture revolution look like in the Cars world? What does free-love look like in a world full of sentient machines? So. Many. Unanswered. Questions.",

There's always room for that.\n\nI did soak the **soap** in hot for just a few mins, and it was super easy to whip it up into a great lather.\n\n**Blade** still working really well.\n\nAbout this **WD Boar brush**, I'm really liking it. Seems to be my kind of backbone (low-to-mid) and feels good. What I'm really curious about is comparing it to my Semogue Owners Club (another fav), to see the difference. I chose this brush for AA with just a few uses on it, and haven't been able to go back to the SOC, yet. You know how the differences between something really jump out at you when you compare them so close together.\n\nOn the **sad front**, I did have to take our cat to the vet today. Ate some chair foam/padding and seems to have a blockage. Little fella might not make it. But he's young, and we're hoping he'll pull through.\n\n**Razor and Blade Notes**\nblade is remarkably still the same, giving very good shaves!\n\n\n**Soap Notes**\nToday's lather with Williams was wonderful. Cushion, elasticity, and superb slickness.\n\nI am working on a generalized method gotten from John L (see 3 days ago). I just casually mixed it today, not keeping track... maybe loading for 30-45 seconds. I then moved to the bowl, adding 2.5 tsp of water right away, instead of gradually. Williams seems to be a soap where you can dump all the water in at the beginning, and just stir till it's right. Very simple. I again, ended up with too much lather, but my boy made good use of it! :-)\n\n**Hot water soak** really seems to transform Williams into an easy to lather soap.\n\n**Brush Notes**\nslowly splaying. still really like it.\n\n----\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger**\n\nUse this to document how long our blades last for this month, and what about them made us pitch 'em. I created a Google Form with just a few questions, if anyone is interested:\n\n[Ending of Blades Ledger](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform)\n\nI'll keep this as my footer each day so you have the link. I'll take it down if no one shows interest.",

As of now, **7 people** are still working on blades that have pretty much lasted the whole month!\n\n**General Notes / Exec Summary / TL;DR**\nPretty good shave. Did 2 lathers actually, because first had too much water. Second did, as well, but not as much. Will add less water for next time.\n\n**Razor and Blade Notes**\nBlade still performing like a star! No pulling, no irritation. Close shaves!\n\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Few hairs are showing some tip length (with most being cut flush)\n\n**Soap Notes**\nToday's lather with Williams was workable, but a bit thin because I reduced soap load time, but should have reduced water more.\n\nI am working on a generalized method gotten from John L (see 4 days ago). Here are today's details...\n\n*Soak*: 7mins (hot)\n*Load*: 30 sec\n*Addt'nl water in bowl*: 1 tsp\n\nHot water soak really seems to transform Williams into an easy to lather soap.\n\nHere are John's procedures, generally-stated...\n\n* soak in hot/warm water\n* give your soaked brush about 0 light shakes (eliminated shakes because he is using badger and I'll bet my boar holds less water)\n* load from mug\n* move to a bowl and stir till the lather is the way you want it. may need to add additional water.\n\nOverall, I think this was an easy way to get to a good lather. Fairly simple and intuitive.\n\nScent strength\nDay 1-2: 3-4/10\nDay 4-5: 2-3/10\nDay 6-7: 2/10\nDay 8-~: 1/10\n\nBest Lathers So Far:\n\n* Bloomed soap (cool water) for 26 mins, 30 sec load with barely damp brush, then ended up adding to a total of 2 tsp water. Looked more like other soaps this time as it became more elastic and hydrated. Had a little cushion, bubbles were very minimal, and was well-slick.\n\n----\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger**\n\nUse this to document how long our blades last for this month, and what about them made us pitch 'em. I created a Google Form with just a few questions, if anyone is interested:\n\n[Ending of Blades Ledger](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform)\n\nI'll keep this as my footer each day so you have the link. I'll take it down if no one shows interest.\n\n*Updated: to add video link*",

Good soap formulation, and blade still superb. My technique must have been on point, because I got no sting from the alc-based balm!\n\n**Razor and Blade Notes**\nblade still going strong. A closer cut than a few days ago, actually. Tiny bit of irritation with it when on the neck area, but goes away very quickly. And a great, close shave.\n\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Cut flush to where I just see the tips (above average for me)\n\n**Soap Notes**\nToday's lather with Williams was very good, and **my best one** that uses the least soap so far. I had very nice glide with the razor. However, I plan to shake a little off the brush next time (to reduce water) to see if I can get the mix just a little richer.\n\nI am working on a generalized method gotten from John L (via a YouTube comment). Here are today's details...\n\n*Soak*: 9mins (hot)\n*Load*: 30 sec\n*Addt'nl water in bowl*: 0 tsp\n\nHot water soak really seems to transform Williams into an easy to lather soap.\n\nHere are John's procedures, generally-stated...\n\n* soak in hot/warm water\n* give your soaked brush about 0 light shakes (eliminated shakes because he is using badger and I'll bet my boar holds less water)\n* load from mug\n* move to a bowl and stir till the lather is the way you want it. may need to add additional water.\n\nOverall, I think this was an easy way to get to a good lather. Fairly simple and intuitive.\n\nScent strength\nDay 1-2: 3-4/10\nDay 4-5: 2-3/10\nDay 6-7: 2/10\nDay 8-~: 1/10\n\nBest Lathers So Far:\n\n* Bloomed soap (cool water) for 26 mins, 30 sec load with barely damp brush, then ended up adding to a total of 2 tsp water. Looked more like other soaps this time as it became more elastic and hydrated. Had a little cushion, bubbles were very minimal, and was well-slick.\n\n----\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger**\n\nUse this to document how long our blades last for this month, and what about them made us pitch 'em. I created a Google Form with just a few questions, if anyone is interested:\n\n[Ending of Blades Ledger](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform)\n\nI'll keep this as my footer each day so you have the link. I'll take it down if no one shows interest.\n",

Blade was super tuggy. I'm pretty sure I looked exactly like the _Home Alone_ kid when I put on the aftershave.\n\nIt's interesting to see how much the blade feels like it's changing from day to day at this point. Yesterday, it could have been a brand new blade, and today it could have been not a blade at all.\n\nToday's loose badger hair count: 25! This is the second time it's matched the date now. Fun.",

And it's easy to replicate, without measuring, etc. Woot!\n\n**Razor and Blade Notes**\nBlade is still spot on, with no noticeable decline over the course of the last few days!\n\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Few hairs are showing some tip length (with most being cut flush)\n\n**Soap Notes**\nToday's lather with Williams was just where I wanted it: richer than yesterday, but not too thick ... and my richest one that uses the least soap so far. I had very nice glide with the razor. I used less water than yesterday to get it, just a few shakes of the brush after soaking it.\n\nBut the **catch** is that my trouble spot didn't get shaved quite as close. I wonder if the *slightly* thinner lather of yesterday, which cut it flush, is better suited for that area? Obviously, it could just be my technique. Whatever can we do? We'll try it tomorrow!\n\nI am working on a generalized method gotten from John L (see 4 days ago). Here are today's details...\n\n*Soak*: 7mins (hot)\n*Load*: 30 sec\n*Shake brush*: 3 medium-light ones\n*Addt'nl water in bowl*: 0 tsp\n\nHot water soak really seems to transform Williams into an easy to lather soap.\n\nHere are John's procedures, generally-stated...\n\n* soak in hot/warm water\n* give your soaked brush about 3 light shakes\n* load from mug\n* move to a bowl and stir till the lather is the way you want it. may need to add additional water.\n\nOverall, I think this was an easy way to get to a good lather. Fairly simple and intuitive.\n\nScent strength\nDay 1-2: 3-4/10\nDay 4-5: 2-3/10\nDay 6-7: 2/10\nDay 8-~: 1/10\n\nBest Lathers So Far:\n\n* **Maybe best cut** ... *Soak*: 7mins (hot); *Load*: 30 sec; *Shake brush*: 0, but hold until drained; *Addt'nl water in bowl*: 0. With this one, lather is a little thinner than what might be called creamy, but the cut result on my trouble spot was nigh perfect.\n* **Easiest way to creamy** ... *Soak*: 7mins (hot); *Load*: 30 sec; *Shake brush*: 3 medium-light ones; *Addt'nl water in bowl*: 0.\n* **The long way** ... Bloomed soap (cool water) for 26 mins, 30 sec load with barely damp brush, then ended up adding to a total of 2 tsp water. Looked more like other soaps this time as it became more elastic and hydrated. Had a little cushion, bubbles were very minimal, and was well-slick.\n\n\n----\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger**\n\nUse this to document how long our blades last for this month, and what about them made us pitch 'em. I created a Google Form with just a few questions, if anyone is interested:\n\n[Ending of Blades Ledger](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform)\n\nI'll keep this as my footer each day so you have the link. I'll take it down if no one shows interest.\n",

What a day. Just spent 12 *straight* hours planting our backyard. The landscape company is finished and now our part begins. Wife ordered 75+ plants, and after we got the weed barrier down, it was time to start digging.\n\nMother. Fucker. That is some seriously hard clay dirt. I had to resort to a pick or a claw hammer a lot of the time in order to make any headway on the holes.\n\nAlso ordered 10 cubic yards of Sierra Cascade mulch to fill all of our beds when done planting. So we slung a lot of mulch.\n\nHow much is 10 cubic yards? Pictures a F-150 parked in your driveway. And now picture a dump truck making that truck dissappear under a pile of mulch.\n\nScientifically speaking, it's a fuck ton of mulch. And we're not done. Gonna finish up tomorrow. So tonight's late night shave was the first chance I've had all day to shower and shave.\n\nGoodnight all.",

I really can't believe its staying this sharp.\n\n**Razor and Blade Notes**\nBlade is still delicious, and delivered a superb shave today.\n\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Cut flush to where I just see the tips (above average for me)\n\n**Soap Notes**\nToday's lather with Williams ended up to be just like yesterday's: rich, but not too thick. I had very nice glide with the razor.\n\nBut this time, my trouble spot did get shaved flush. Maybe my problem with yesterday was just off technique, or some other variable. The one change I did today was to use the soak water to do a pre-wash. Most of the time, I don't.\n\nI am working on a generalized method gotten from John L (see 5 days ago). Here are today's details...\n\n*Soak*: 8mins (hot)\n*Load*: 30 sec\n*Shake brush*: 2 medium-light ones (this is probably what it ended up to be)\n*Addt'nl water in lather bowl*: 0.75 tsp\n\nHot water soak really seems to transform Williams into an easy to lather soap.\n\nHere are John's procedures, generally-stated...\n\n* soak in hot/warm water\n* give your soaked brush about 3 light shakes\n* load from mug\n* move to a bowl and stir till the lather is the way you want it. may need to add additional water.\n\nOverall, I think this was an easy way to get to a good lather. Fairly simple and intuitive.\n\nScent strength\nDay 1-2: 3-4/10\nDay 4-5: 2-3/10\nDay 6-7: 2/10\nDay 8-~: 1/10\n\nBest Lathers So Far:\n\n* Maybe best cut ... *Soak*: 7mins (hot); *Load*: 30 sec; *Shake brush*: 0, but hold until drained; *Addt'nl water in bowl*: 0. With this one, lather is a little thinner than what might be called creamy, but the cut result on my trouble spot was nigh perfect.\n* Easiest way to creamy ... *Soak*: 7mins (hot); *Load*: 30 sec; *Shake brush*: 3 medium-light ones; *Addt'nl water in bowl*: 0.\n* The long way ... Bloomed soap (cool water) for 26 mins, 30 sec load with barely damp brush, then ended up adding to a total of 2 tsp water. Looked more like other soaps this time as it became more elastic and hydrated. Had a little cushion, bubbles were very minimal, and was well-slick.\n\n\n**Brush Notes**\nI'm not seeing too many tips split yet. I wonder if I should do some kind of boar shortcut break-in.\n\n----\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger**\n\nUse this to document how long our blades last for this month, and what about them made us pitch 'em. I created a Google Form with just a few questions, if anyone is interested:\n\n[Ending of Blades Ledger](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform)\n\nI'll keep this as my footer each day so you have the link. I'll take it down if no one shows interest.\n",

It seems that almost any blade I put in it performs twice as well as in a typical DE. I got The Beast from someone looking to clear out his den, and I immediately got hooked on the scent. Reminds me of Stirling's Sandpiper (which is one of my all-time favorites), but with a little bit more vetiver and cedar. Comes through very nicely.\nThis was my first time using TTFFC, and I was not at all disappointed. Doing a face lather it felt very cushion-y and worked great for my WTG pass, but when I lathered for my second pass which is XTG, it thinned out a bit. I usually lightly pat my face in between passes, but this time I didn't. When I went back to clean up a bit on the neck, I made sure that my face wasn't TOO wet, and it did just as well as my first pass. So I think I had it just a hair shy of too wet, which says a lot about this soap not being particularly thirsty. All in all a great shave before heading in for night shift.",

I seem to be shaving more at night, so I don't have much need for it. The postshave on Stubble Buster is good enough that I don't need it, so really I've just been using it for a tiny scent kick.\n\nThe blade is still going strong and I have every intention of pushing it as far as it will go. I may experiment with these Light Brigades after AA but I'll keep the Perma Sharp around just to see how long I can push it.\n\nBonus pic: was driving home and this pic got me hype for Summer Break - Back to School\n\nhttps://imgur.com/BJoNRui.jpg",

      "body": "*Razor*: Blackland - **Dart** (Machined)\n*Blade*: **Gillette - Nacet** (29)\n*Lather*: **Williams Mug Soap**\n*Brush*: **Whipped Dog - Boar** 24mm\n*Post*: Afta - Fresh\n\n----\n\n**Ultra Nightmare Mode**\n\n[Video](https://youtu.be/AymcDQvloaw)\n\n**General Notes / Exec Summary / TL;DR**\nTried to be a little more conservative with the lather today, so tried just a 20 sec load. That amt of soap seems to be a bit harder to get to creamy. But it was still very enjoyable, and a lather that most Williams detractors would be amazed if they saw it.\n\n**Razor and Blade Notes**\nBlade still doing really well. Nice, close shave with no irritation. Today's shave was a little rushed with less focus on technique, so I had to do that 4th, neck-only, pass.\n\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Smooth\n*Neck*: Smooth\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Few hairs are showing some tip length (with most being cut flush)\n\n**Soap Notes**\nToday's lather with Williams ended up to be a little less than rich. I added a little too much water while mixing up the lather. I had very nice glide with the razor.\n\nI did some video review today of other guys mixing Williams and I've learned something: I was focusing too much, especially at the beginning, about not getting that bubbly, airy lather. But it's okay. Just don't stop there. Keep mixing and that will turn into something much nicer.\n\nI am working on a generalized method gotten from John L (see 5 days ago). Here are today's details...\n\n*Soak*: 8mins (hot)\n*Load*: 30 sec\n*Shake brush*: 2 medium-light ones (this is probably what it ended up to be)\n*Addt'nl water in lather bowl*: 0.75 tsp\n\nHot water soak really seems to transform Williams into an easy to lather soap.\n\nHere are John's procedures, generally-stated...\n\n* soak in hot/warm water\n* give your soaked brush about 3 light shakes\n* load from mug\n* move to a bowl and stir till the lather is the way you want it. may need to add additional water.\n\nOverall, I think this was an easy way to get to a good lather. Fairly simple and intuitive.\n\nScent strength\nDay 1-2: 3-4/10\nDay 4-5: 2-3/10\nDay 6-7: 2/10\nDay 8-~: 1/10\n\nBest Lathers So Far:\n\n* Maybe best cut ... *Soak*: 7mins (hot); *Load*: 30 sec; *Shake brush*: 0, but hold until drained; *Addt'nl water in bowl*: 0. With this one, lather is a little thinner than what might be called creamy, but the cut result on my trouble spot was nigh perfect.\n* Easiest way to creamy ... *Soak*: 7mins (hot); *Load*: 30 sec; *Shake brush*: 3 medium-light ones; *Addt'nl water in bowl*: 0.\n* The long way ... Bloomed soap (cool water) for 26 mins, 30 sec load with barely damp brush, then ended up adding to a total of 2 tsp water. Looked more like other soaps this time as it became more elastic and hydrated. Had a little cushion, bubbles were very minimal, and was well-slick.\n\n\n----\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger**\n\nUse this to document how long our blades last for this month, and what about them made us pitch 'em. I created a Google Form with just a few questions, if anyone is interested:\n\n[Ending of Blades Ledger](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform)\n\nI'll keep this as my footer each day so you have the link. I'll take it down if no one shows interest.\n",

I'm going to still try to complete 31 shaves with this set up, but I gave up trying to squeeze a shave into my days when I didn't feel like it. Not keeping up and shaving when I want to is freeeing, but I've still been sure to wear the frag each and every day of August so far in an effort to not escape the monotony.

Another irritation-free, comfortable, very close shave from this setup.\n\n**Three more shaves to go!**\n\n**Razor and Blade Notes**\nBlade strong like Thag.\n\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Few hairs are showing some tip length (with most being cut flush)\n\n**Soap Notes**\nToday's lather with Williams ended up to be a little less than rich. I added a little too much water while mixing up the lather... this time by not shaking off some from the brush. I had very nice glide with the razor, though, and a great shave.\n\nI am working on a generalized method gotten from John L (see 5 days ago). Here are today's details...\n\n*Soak*: 8mins (hot)\n*Load*: 20 sec\n*Shake brush*: 0 medium-light ones\n*Addt'nl water in lather bowl*: 0 tsp\n\nHot water soak really seems to transform Williams into an easy to lather soap.\n\nHere are John's procedures, generally-stated...\n\n* soak in hot/warm water\n* give your soaked brush about 3 light shakes\n* load from mug\n* move to a bowl and stir till the lather is the way you want it. may need to add additional water.\n\nOverall, I think this was an easy way to get to a good lather. Fairly simple and intuitive.\n\nScent strength\nDay 1-2: 3-4/10\nDay 4-5: 2-3/10\nDay 6-7: 2/10\nDay 8-~: 1/10\n\nBest Lathers So Far:\n\n* Maybe best cut ... *Soak*: 7mins (hot); *Load*: 30 sec; *Shake brush*: 0, but hold until drained; *Addt'nl water in bowl*: 0. With this one, lather is a little thinner than what might be called creamy, but the cut result on my trouble spot was nigh perfect.\n* Easiest way to creamy ... *Soak*: 7mins (hot); *Load*: 30 sec; *Shake brush*: 3 medium-light ones; *Addt'nl water in bowl*: 0.\n* The long way ... Bloomed soap (cool water) for 26 mins, 30 sec load with barely damp brush, then ended up adding to a total of 2 tsp water. Looked more like other soaps this time as it became more elastic and hydrated. Had a little cushion, bubbles were very minimal, and was well-slick.\n\n----\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger**\n\nUse this to document how long our blades last for this month, and what about them made us pitch 'em. I created a Google Form with just a few questions, if anyone is interested:\n\n[Ending of Blades Ledger](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform)\n\nI'll keep this as my footer each day so you have the link. I'll take it down if no one shows interest.\n",

Tom Petty (and a few Heartbreakers), Jeff Lyne, Steve Winwood, Prince, and Dhani Harrison play \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps.\"]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SFNW5F8K9Y)\n\nI guess I've just never felt moved to write about a guitar solo before but at 3:28, Prince hits the first note of a guitar solo that I've never experienced anything like before, in a crowd or on a stage or on a screen. He's in a red and black suit and what I believe is called a Homburg Hat, wielding an orange guitar and there are so many great moments. During the solo and even before. All times are approximate.\n\nAt about 1:35, when Steve Winwood does a sick glissando.\n\nAt about 2:19, when the tambourine guy is artfully dramatic.\n\nAt about 3:28, when the solo starts and I feel compelled to keep the same formatting for all of these timestamps.\n\nAt about 4:03, that crazy thing he does with his left hand. So cool. Fuck. I hope there's a name for that.\n\nAt about 4:23, when Prince looks at Tom Petty like \"Tommy, watch this now.\"\n\nAt about 4:43, when he leans way back over and lets that guy catch him.\n\nAt about 4:45, when Dhani Harrison goes full /r/youseeingthisshit.\n\nAt about 4:56, when Prince looks at Tom Petty like \"I'm about to commit sex and crime on stage with an orange guitar.\"\n\nAt about 4:57, when Prince commits sex and crime on stage with an orange guitar, while Tom Petty and me watch. Heh.\n\nAt about 5:06, when his bottom lip almost flies off his face.\n\nAt about 6:09, when the song is over and he throws his guitar and walks away.\n\nAnyways. Great song. Great performance. So good that NYTimes did [a short piece about it.]( https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/28/arts/music/prince-guitar-rock-hall-of-fame.html) RIP Tom and Prince. And George Harrison too.\n\n**Shave notes and et cetera**\n\n* I didn't get a chance to post the pic but [this shit happened yesterday.]( https://imgur.com/a/NYikD7b) But you know like I ain't even mad man cuz I'm a strong, independent wetshaver and I don't need no stinking mug!\n\n* I used a shavette for the first time today. I bought one from Amazon a few weeks ago and figured I'd try it out this morning to line up my goatee. /u/needsmorementhol, it was [this one, with those Derby blades.]( https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0118BJ0PA/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) I was very happy with it. It was only a little bitey, not as bad as I expected . I only drew blood in one tiny little spot and I was able to get my goat lined up better than I ever have with a DE. I'm very pleased and I look forward to using it more. *And* it just feels awesome to use. I've never had a problem resisting a straight razor because they kinda scare the bejesus outta me (and are expensive) but this feels pretty good in my hands...\n\n* I tag NMM on that last one cuz he knows [stuff.]( https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/921vls/thursday_daily_questions_newbie_friendly_jul_26/e33wg3o/)\n\n* I got [this stuff](https://imgur.com/a/NN7ECoN) in the mail today. Someone please learn me how to do this.\n\n* This is overdue but I have to formally thank /u/bdubelyew for the Secret Santa gifts. It's almost eerie that he knew exactly what I needed. I had the Shaken soap but not the splash; he sent the splash but he didn't know I had the soap. I had the puck of Tabac but I didn't have the ceramic Tabac container. He couldn't possibly know that. He sent the ceramic Tabac container. In addition, he sent some Naranja Scale Polish, which I am so excited to use. He also sent a Stirling DE head *AND* my favorite part, he sent me this awesome fucking brush (see my Austere as Fuck pic) that I've been learning how to use all month! I am so happy with all this stuff. He really rounded out my collection in a huge way. THANK YOU!\n\n* [There was this.]( https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/87q7mr/wednesday_sotd_thread_mar_28_2018/dwewwpl/) And but so and there was [also this.]( https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/947s2a/friday_austere_august_sotd_thread_aug_03_2018/e3j44wb/) In short, I should learn to listen to people who are smarter than I am. Thank you to everyone on this board. This is a good place to be. Now jus' go on and tell me that sometimes, the best part of the day is the shave and the SOTD post. Go on.\n\nHappy shaves everyone! Two more days to go and the dens reopen!",

So Austere August ends a couple of days short. I went with the Barrbarr and the Maggard Black and White/Tuxedo Synthetic all month with a series of different razors and blades, so I think that put me in the normal mode. I don't plan to shave for the next couple of days and then will start September with a run with the Reserve Seville, which has been taunting me all month. I've enjoyed the Barrbarr and certainly order a tub of the new version shortly. As much as I love this soap, I'm happy to move on to something new.\n\n[the end](https://imgur.com/gallery/9rbOWNE)",

No more rinsing between passes. Didn't rinse again today, and got another spectacular shave. I'm really surprised by how much of a difference this seems to make.\n\nAnother thing I've noticed is that I've gradually started holding the razor more toward the top of the handle. I'm sure that's also contributing to the improved shaves, but the no-rinsing thing seems to have made a sudden huge difference, while the razor choking has been a gradual progression.\n\nToday's loose badger hair count: 23. Pretty sure this is now the median number of hairs lost per day.\n\nAlso: two more days, everyone! We've almost made it!",

This one gave me pretty good suds, definitely usable. And the 2nd and 3rd passes were actually very nice, with good slickness and glide.\n\n**Razor and Blade Notes**\n31 shaves in it now. Nacet is going strong.\n\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Few hairs are showing some tip length (with most being cut flush)\n\n**Soap Notes**\nSince finding a rich creamy lather from Williams using a hot soak and 20 second load seemed to be inevitable by just reducing the water, I decided to shift back to a pure face lather. I had done that in the middle of the month, with success at thin lathers, but nothing rich. Now armed with my new knowledge of the hot soak, I thought to try taking it all in the face again.\n\nThis is a very convenient hot soak, not one that you have to start way before you shave. I just start it as my first step, and then it's ready by the time I've prepped my stuff. If you do a pre-shave shower, that is also a great time to start the soak.\n\nThis is the formula that gave me an okay lather, though a little thinner than I want. I'm going for a richer one, so I'll give the brush a couple more shakes next time before loading.\n\n1. Start the hot water soak of the soap\n2. Prep other gear\n3. Shake brush about 4 times to reduce water. (I might try 5 or 6 next time)\n4. Load brush: 10 sec\n5. Work into face, removing any lather that gets to be too much and placing it in the soap cup for use on third pass.\n\n(Note that I'm using a fairly new boar that doesn't hold as much soap as some larger/older boars and badgers, etc. So you may be able to gather enough soap for the whole shave in your brush.)\n\nI had very nice glide with the razor, after the first pass.\n\nOverall, I think this was an easy way to get to a good lather. Fast, simple, and intuitive.\n\nScent strength\nDay 1-2: 3-4/10\nDay 4-5: 2-3/10\nDay 6-7: 2/10\nDay 8-~: 1/10\n\nBest Lathers So Far:\n\n* Maybe best cut ... *Soak*: 7mins (hot); *Load*: 30 sec; *Shake brush*: 0, but hold until drained; *Addt'nl water in bowl*: 0. With this one, lather is a little thinner than what might be called creamy, but the cut result on my trouble spot was nigh perfect.\n* Easiest way to creamy ... *Soak*: 7mins (hot); *Load*: 30 sec; *Shake brush*: 3 medium-light ones; *Addt'nl water in bowl*: 0.\n* The long way ... Bloomed soap (cool water) for 26 mins, 30 sec load with barely damp brush, then ended up adding to a total of 2 tsp water. Looked more like other soaps this time as it became more elastic and hydrated. Had a little cushion, bubbles were very minimal, and was well-slick.\n\n\n----\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger**\n\nUse this to document how long our blades last for this month, and what about them made us pitch 'em. I created a Google Form with just a few questions, if anyone is interested:\n\n[Ending of Blades Ledger](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform)\n\nI'll keep this as my footer each day so you have the link. I'll take it down if no one shows interest.\n",

It's not as bad as you might think. Random thots keep trying to buy me tacos and take me home. Which is a nice boost for the confidence, but a real productivity killer.\n\nPhteven's phandle output is impressive, but is orders of magnitude more impressive, considering he's probably drowning all the time.\n\nWhile AA is predictably boring because of the predictability, it is logically great for developing better shaves. I've had more consistent outstanding shaves this month than at any other time since I fell down this rabbit hole, Alice. After the first week or so, I've been really dialed in with this soap and razor. I'm getting real BBS shaves everyday now, even on my neck, which can be a trick with a SR. But with the consistent equipment every day, I've had the touch to try a few different styles of strokes for my neck which seem to be working out really nicely.\n\nEven though AA is almost over, I'm confident that some of this will carry over to my other razors.\n\nHappy Wednesday errbody.",

I don't know that I want to try to improve on it!\n\n**Razor and Blade Notes**\nA couple dozen hairs still showed length. Let's see if the blade bounces back tomorrow. Still comfy though.\n\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Few hairs are showing some tip length (with most being cut flush)\n\n**Soap Notes**\nThis time, I'm trying NO soak of the soap at all. But I know I'll have to load for longer to compensate.\n\nThis is the formula that gave me about as good a lather as I could expect. I think I like it better than the hot soak face lather. On first pass, it was a little thinner than I want, but fairly enjoyable. And the 2nd and 3rd were great: a little cushion and tons of slickness and glide. And I didn't waste very much lather at all.\n\n1. Dip brush fully in water (I just soak mine)\n3. Shake brush about 5 times to reduce water.\n4. Load brush: 60 sec\n5. Work into face, removing any lather that gets to be too much and placing it in the soap cup for use on third pass if needed.\n\n(This is good for my fairly young 24mm boar brush)\n\nOverall, I think this was an easy way to get to a good lather. Fast-ish, simple, and intuitive.\n\nScent strength\nDay 1-2: 3-4/10\nDay 4-5: 2-3/10\nDay 6-7: 2/10\nDay 8-~: 1/10\n\nBest Lathers So Far:\n\n* Maybe best cut ... *Soak*: 7mins (hot); *Load*: 30 sec; *Shake brush*: 0, but hold until drained; *Addt'nl water in bowl*: 0. With this one, lather is a little thinner than what might be called creamy, but the cut result on my trouble spot was nigh perfect.\n* Easiest way to creamy ... *Soak*: 7mins (hot); *Load*: 30 sec; *Shake brush*: 3 medium-light ones; *Addt'nl water in bowl*: 0.\n* The long way ... Bloomed soap (cool water) for 26 mins, 30 sec load with barely damp brush, then ended up adding to a total of 2 tsp water. Looked more like other soaps this time as it became more elastic and hydrated. Had a little cushion, bubbles were very minimal, and was well-slick.\n* Best Face Lather ... this one!\n\n\n\n**Brush Notes**\nOpening up gradually, but not too many tips split at all.\n\n----\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger**\n\nUse this to document how long our blades last for this month, and what about them made us pitch 'em. I created a Google Form with just a few questions, if anyone is interested:\n\n[Ending of Blades Ledger](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform)\n\nI'll keep this as my footer each day so you have the link. I'll take it down if no one shows interest.\n",

Fight me.\n\nWhat a fascinating month. I laughed. I cried. I learned how to love and use a Badger brush, after only having used synthetics before. And I now feel confident that I can get a perfect lather from Summer Break Soaps every time.\n\nAs far as this badger brush goes, consider me a convert. This thing got a lot softer over the month and splays much more willingly than it did at first. I still use my synths for practice lathers but they just feel a little...soulless now. Or something. They don't seem to hold as much lather as the badger does. This all just really makes me wanna try some other badgers, maybe a higher-end one too. I do have an Omega 10049 boar in my Maggard cart now.\n\nThis was a difficult month at times. Especially every time I got a new box. I was having to content myself with practice lathers, which I did many of but I'm really looking to getting back to my den. If I hadn't participated in this AA, I'd probably be willing to do Sample September but as it stands, I have to decline. I'm done with rules for awhile.\n\nWill I do this again next year? I honestly don't even know. Maybe if I have some new gear to learn how to use. But at this point, I cannot commit one way or the other.\n\nThanks to everyone who did the AA thing and congrats to those who finished on ULTRA-NIGHTMARE mode.\n\nWhat's everyone's first shave gonna be after AA?\n\nSeville in Reserve is on deck for me.\n\n\n\n\n",

Don't use it. If it's in your bowl, keep stirring. If it's on your face, keep brushing.\n* I really enjoyed learning from you guys as we all went through this together. You learned about your own soap, or blade or razor... and I enjoyed soaking that up as well.\n* I learned the hot soak works well with Williams (allowing a 10 sec load), but so does 60 seconds of loading on a dry puck, with a medium-hydrated brush. So it's a bit of a trade-off, and you can choose what method works best for your procedures.\n* I was wondering if I would regret sticking to just one soap for a whole month. Well, I did it for a good cause. Williams is a good soap, especially for anyone who isn't trying for the fastest shave possible. Slickness is incredible and it's not too hard to dial up lathers that rival just about anything out there, regardless of price. I mainly did it for those guys out there who are on a budget, so they can get the best out of an inexpensive soap.\n* I've figured out a few different ways to get a really good lather from Williams, and they're not difficult. It's basically about remembering the first bullet point as you whip up your lather.\n* For those budget seekers, I learned that Williams may not be the most cost-effective soap out there. **PDP 63** lasts so long that I think it beats the W. And getting the 1kg block of **Cella** is such a great deal on a soap that smells great and lathers easily.\n* I've also learned that it looks like I'm going to get between 1.5 and 2 months of uses from my one puck.\n* I learned that... if the smell (citronella) is a detractor for some, they should try it anyway. If you keep it in an open mug/cup/bowl, then the scent dissipates after just a few days, resolving to a nice, light, classic soapy smell that reminds you of shaves of yesteryear.\n* I found ways to avoid the airy/soapy early part of the lather, but they involved adding water so slowly, that I think it's just better to let the airy stuff come up and then let it reduce to good lather with your mixing.\n\n## Now for today's shave...\n\n**General Notes / Exec Summary / TL;DR**\nTrying for creamy with a hot soak face lather. Almost got there. Still a bit much water.\n\n**Razor and Blade Notes**\nBlade finishes the month as strong as ever! And the Dart was, at least for people with my skin type, a studly, manly razor, giving blade feel, but was predictable and consistent!\n\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Few hairs are showing some tip length (with most being cut flush)\n\n**Soap Notes**\nGot to a reasonable, but not quite dense enough to call creamy, lather with light cushion, tons of glide, and protection. 2nd pass was even better. Third was a bit low on lather. Went back to cup. Then had to reconstitute that.\n\nThis time, I went back to the hot soak for my last day. I know if I get the right water concentration, it will be even nicer.\n\nToday:\n\n1. Soak puck in hot water for 5-10 mins\n2. Dip brush fully in water (I just soak mine)\n3. Shake/jostle brush about 7 times to reduce water.\n4. Load brush: 10 sec\n5. Work into face, removing any lather that gets to be too much and placing it in the soap cup for use on third pass if needed.\n\n(This is good for my fairly young 24mm boar brush. A larger brush that holds more water would need adjustment.)\n\nOverall, I think this was an easy way to get to a good lather. Fast-ish, simple, and intuitive.\n\nScent strength\nDay 1-2: 3-4/10\nDay 4-5: 2-3/10\nDay 6-7: 2/10\nDay 8-~: 1/10\n\nBest Lathers So Far:\n\n* Maybe best cut ... *Soak*: 7mins (hot); *Shake brush*: 0, but hold until drained; *Load*: 30 sec; *Addt'nl water in bowl*: 0. With this one, lather is a little thinner than what might be called creamy, but the cut result on my trouble spot was nigh perfect.\n* Easiest bowl way to creamy ... *Soak*: 7mins (hot); *Shake brush*: 3 medium-light ones; *Load*: 30 sec; *Addt'nl water in bowl*: 0.\n* The long way ... Bloomed soap (cool water) for 26 mins (that long probably not necessary), 30 sec load with barely damp brush, then ended up adding to a total of 2 tsp water. Looked more like other soaps this time as it became more elastic and hydrated. Had a little cushion, bubbles were very minimal, and was well-slick.\n* Best Face Lather ... No soap soak; Load: 60 secs; Brush Shakes: 5 med-light. First pass could have been thicker but rest were great.\n\n\n**Brush Notes**\nBrush is a slow grower, which is fine with me. A couple of tips have split since I started. Splay is slow to widen. Don't know if using it every day made it go slow since it never really dried off. Really enjoy it. May look into shortcut methods to split the tips.\n\n----\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger**\n\nUse this to document how long our blades last for this month, and what about them made us pitch 'em. I created a Google Form with just a few questions, if anyone is interested:\n\n[Ending of Blades Ledger Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform)\n\n[And here's the spreadsheet with all the 7 entries](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing). It doesn't hurt anything to keep this up, so I guess I will. Hopefully more will roll in as we start to see blades get used up.\n\nI'll keep this as my footer each day so you have the link. I'll take it down if no one shows interest.",
