And today was a test lather to see if my stained tap water was what killed my lather the other day. (It turned out inconclusive)\n\n#### ❧ Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Gillette - Rocket HD ::: Feather ‹24 uses›)*\n\nWhile I got a nice, close shave, it was harsh, but just to a small degree. Maybe another blade would suit me better with this razor. No tugging.\n\n#### ❧ Soap Notes\n*^(Stirling - Stirling for Him)*\n\nLather not quite as good as yesterday, but still worked well and I had 2 extra passes when done.\n\n1/4 tsp soap + with lightly-wet brush + 2.5 tsp water = 5 passes of scrumptious lather.\n\nScent: a nice light cologne scent. I like it.\n\nScent Strength: 3-4/10, lightly present during shaving.\n\nBowl - I used the XL version of this bowl:\nhttps://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3392930\n\n\n#### ❧ Brush Notes\n*^(Semogue - 1250 Boar ‹9 uses›)*\n\nsmooth and enjoyable.\n\n#### ❧ Shave Quality\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: A little irritating\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Cut flush to where I just see the tips (above average for me)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm)\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

Pomona smells so good, I look forward to using this sample again. I wouldn't call it masculine or feminine. I would peg the forward note, for my stupid nose, as red wine and it's just so damn good. I think this will be the next soap/splash/frag set that I get from SW. Along with the upcoming \"floral petrichor,\" (the name escapes me,) he might as well just have access to my bank account.\n\nI really like this little open comb. I've only used it a handful of times but it's very smooth. It's the only open comb I've ever used and I feel like it's lulling me into a false sense of security, given that open combs have the reputation of being pretty aggressive. This one is not, though.

I bought a Rockwell 6s last week and it gives and excellent shave. Right now, I feel like it's superior to the Maggards V3 by a fair bit, but I hate to neglect it. Hence the reason for the Maggards the last few days.\n\nWith soaps, I let my mood guide me, but I feel like it's never an issue of performance with soap, only scent. There's day scents, night scents, work scents, ect. I've justified to myself buying a ton of soaps, but I'm having s hard time wrapping my head around razors. I feel like razors are all about performance. At what point do you guys reach for a vintage fattip over a straight, ect?\n\nI suppose I would ask the same about brushes. If you have a top of the line Declaration Grooming brush, at what point are you reaching for something else?\n\nI don't know. I can understand keeping a razor that was your fathers, or a brush you bought to mark a promotion. I guess this Rockwell has got me thinking about what it means to collect as part of a hobby.\n\nRobot\n",

The H1 will be reserved to mow down multiple days worth of growth. Stealth is a terrific floral scent with Juniper Berries and Jasmine with a base of sandalwood and amber. This could be my favorite of their scents so far. Herc Soaps are easy to lather and offer a comfortable, slick, dense lather. The Wizamet blade was very sharp, so I look forward to it smoothing out over the next few shaves.",

Performance wise, this is top tier, probably top 3 imho. Scent wise I'm a little torn on this. It kinda smells like orange juiced spilled on a strippers snatch after she's worked a full shift. And you know what, I kinda like it.... In all seriousness though, the aftershave really punches you in the nose. Overall an interesting shave to say the least.",

Even though it was only a single shave, I made a deliberate attempt to keep the DE technique, I feared going too fast would result in a painful mistake. I made the lather extra thick and it smelled so good and applied so nicely. The lather was the thing that disappointed me the most yesterday; that barbasol neither smelled good nor looked good. I even tried using a brush on it trying to whip it up with water and air, but nothing could revive it. Ended up tossing it in the trash, something I should have done 2 years ago.\n\nSecond day in a row using the Brewcity pomade. I think I'm getting the hang of it, but by the end of work yesterday my hair looked, for lack of a better word, gross. Not the pomade's fault, but I have to wear a hat most of the time. So picture yourself with hat hair and then an attempt to refluff up the majority with product, but that outer ring where the hat ended is still visible. So I need to figure that part out.\n\nLife is short, shave with good gear.\n",

I don't see my other brushes getting very much use in the near future. B7 is densely packed with super fine, soft hairs with quite a bit of backbone. I really like it so far. Serious question though, is it bad to use the same badger brush everyday? Like, does it have to be bone dry before using it again? I don't want to do anything detrimental to this beauty.\n\n​",

My wife didn't care for the scent out of the sample jar but it really opened up to an earthy floral scent once lathered. I'll have to get her to smell it off the brush with my next head shave.\n\nSW's vegan base is really fantastic and I had no issues with the lather or post shave feel of the soap itself. I'm definitely going to enjoy using the rest of the sample.",

This seems to be where this razor shines for me. A&E's post shave feel is immaculate, so really didn't need the balm. Not sure if I'm digging the scent on St. Barts though, as it was advertised as more lime forward, but all I really get is the coconut. Happy Friday, we made it!",

As soon as I started to build up a lather with the Pasha's Pride I was reminded of Oud Wood so I decided I'd wear that today. I'm a big Wholly Kaw fan so I usually go into the weekend using one of their soaps. Very pleased with the water buffalo milk base, it made the donkey milk base just a smidge better and post shave really is fantastic.\n\nHope everyone has a good weekend!",

I've been posting sporadically recently. It's just kinda been one of those months where nothing seems to go your way. As the saying goes, when it rains, it pours. I guess I'm currently in the middle of a terrential downpour.\n\nAnyways, to the shave. I've been using my Semogue more often. I have actually noticed a good amount of progress on it and it now can actually lather for 3 passes. I just wish the know was a little bigger.\n\nTech as always. Great daily driver. I hope to pick up a Karve with and A plate soon enough to compare. The Wilkinson Sword is a blade I've been testing, so far quite impressed.\n\nThis soap is my best performer, and a great scent. Not my favorite soap, but definitely my best. L'homme doesn't go the best with this, but it's versatile enough that it works.\n\nHappy Friday everyone. I hope you have a better weekend than I'm about to have!",

I really like the way the Maze handle looks, but it's too small. So, today I used the brass General handle I have here to see what that was like. It was awesome! I'd really like if the maze handle were this size...sigh. I'll go back to the Maze and see if it's something I can get used to. Time will tell.\n\nI was really happy to get back to Bali Hai!!! I think I'm down to the last few shaves with it, it's already been scraped to a mound in the middle, now that mound has a hole too. =(\nGood thing I have a backup tub!!! =P\n\nFantastic shave today, BBS most places, even danger zones, hopefully I don't catch any ingrowns for that!\n\nHappy Friday all!!!",

WTG, XTG, Clean up. A bit tuggy but way better than the cartridge razor. The shave cream worked up well. Not the most slick but good working lather. And that Balm though.. Whew. Winter is coming.\n\n**The Soap** was a great value choice. It's probably the best local shave creams around. It works up a good lather that performs well and smells fine. It smells a bit like a Hollister store except a bit lighter. It's not very slick but it works. It's similar to Proraso but it does have Aloe Vera and it moisturizes the skin a tad bit more.\n\n**The Razor and Blade** combination was decent. Despite the blade's tenth shave, the combo shaved well and knocked out most of the stubbles. The shave wasn't perfect but it'll do for an average day. This'll be the last shave for the Derby Extra. Not my favorite blade but it shows that I can use most blades to a certain extent. I can't go ATG with it but two pass + clean up works fine.\n\n**The Brush** worked well today. For some reason, my face was a bit more sensitive couple days ago. Today, the scritch of the brush didn't phase me as much. I enjoyed the exfoliation a bit more. I made a great lather and I want to keep working the brush until it gets even softer. I heard that horse hair stays scritchy but I want to see for myself.\n\n**The aftershave portion** was amazing. I prepped my face with the WH and put on the Duke's Balm. What a FRESH feeling! The Ice Cold is no joke. There is a ton of Menthol inside this balm and it feels like my skin was burning. But, it's only menthol and it went away after 10 min or so. But still, Duke's Balm is one of my favorite going forward. It softened my skin and cooled it so much. I love it.\n\nOverall, a decent shave. Last time for the blade and I'll try another blade and try a marathon with it. The shave cream works well so I'll probably use it for travel or as a part of my rotation. The Duke's Balm is great and I'll continue to use it. Awesome shave today.",

I did a WTG pass, then a slightly XTG pass, finishing the ATG with the ATT R1. I have to say, it went pretty well. I took my time and used small strokes. Very close shave overall with no weepers. King of Bourbon is a great scent and Wholly Kaw has the best post shave of all my soaps. Hope everyone is having a great weekend!",

I'd say that's pretty accurate.\n\nI did it again without realizing it. I went from one of my lightest razors yesterday to my heaviest today. I noticed the weight, which is obvious, but I seem to adjust to it with no thought. I suspect that the same would be true if I reversed the order.\n\nYeah...Saturday stuff.",

All of the rain ended up causing me to reach for Summer Storm.\n\nSummer Storm has this earthy, petrichor scent with some floral notes all wrapped together. I like Fougere's so I thought this would be a home run, but I never ended up taking to it. I think it's personal preference. I can tell it's a good scent, it's just not for me.\n\nI'm working some night shifts this week so my schedule has been all sorts of wonky. I was mentioning In the free talk Friday thread that I was missing some Texas BBQ. Well after that conversation, I'm now planning to have tri-tip tacos (they are marinating as I type this) for dinner tonight so there's that to look forward to.\n\nHave a great Saturday!",

BBS everywhere except the problem areas with zero irritation anywhere in 3 light passes with no clean-ups, which is pretty cool... I guess this is the new standard by which my other razors and blades will be judged. It'd be nice to find a combination that can smooth the neck right down to BBS in 3 passes without any buffing / hooking and with the same level of comfort.\n\nExecutive Man always makes me happy, and now I have an Aventus-themed cologne to go with it too. I'll try to remember to pop back in later and post my thoughts about the fragrance.\n\n**Edit:** My wife, who enjoys almost zero fragrances ever (especially florals, orientals, fougeres, and \"fresh\" laundry scents, all of which give her headaches or severe sinus irritation), commented that she actually *likes this scent.* That's a good sign. So far the list of shaving products she enjoys is: Cella, Stirling Dunshire, Stirling Executive Man, and Stirling Peach. So... candy and fruit, basically.\n\n**Edit #2: End of Day** I went with a single pump of l'Aventure on my wrist this morning because I didn't know how well my wife would handle it (see above). As a result the scent was a bit on the weak side, but 14 hours later I can still smell subtle hints of it. It opened up fruity (as expected of an Aventus style fragrance) and quickly settled down to a *very* woody heart scent for several hours - pretty much pure birch lumber. I didn't notice much jasmine or lily of the valley. Eventually the birch wore off and left me with the nice sweet/smokey musky scent that I associate with Aventus's drydown. Every once in a while I seem to catch a little whiff of pineapple again, which is fun.\n\nAlso, I tried out O'Douds Multi-Purpose Pomade today for the first time. Scent is described as \"citrus / cedar\" but I would describe it as \"freshly cut pressure-treated lumber,\" which is... not my favorite wood to run through a saw. Hopefully this scent grows on me because the performance of the pomade itself was pretty nice. Meanwhile, my buddy tried out some Nostalgic Grooming Moon Paste and told me it smelled \"exactly like a tub of cake frosting.\" Jealous.",

I decided to treat myself with some LP after getting a matching toner in the mail this week to complete my second set, so I decided to give it a whirl. Now, I knew that I'd miss that bite of the alcohol, so I may have mixed about a half thumbnail's worth of cryogen soap in with my lather to get some kind of pop this AM. Worked magnificently and didn't effect the performance or scent at all. Lovely, lovely scent that I know is gonna last all day!",

This time I reproduce yesterday's shave, but with the B10 that started it all.\n\n#### ❧ Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Gillette - Aristocrat Junior 51/53 - UK ::: Feather ‹25 uses›)*\n\nThis razor and blade are maybe a little on the aggressive side of the middle line between comfort and aggressive. With the Feather in, I felt like I needed to make sure my technique was good, but the razor is just mild enough that I had the feeling that as long as I was a little careful, I'd get a great shave with no rash or nicks.\n\nNo tugging or irritation.\n\n#### ❧ Soap Notes\n*^(Stirling - Stirling for Him)*\n\nLather not quite as plentiful as yesterday, but I had just enough to do the job.\n\n30 sec brush load with lightly-wet brush + 2 tsp water = 3 passes of wet, slick, non-creamy, but very shavable lather.\n\nScent: a nice light cologne scent. I like it. Patterned after Versace Pour Homme\n\nScent Strength: 3-4/10, lightly present during shaving.\n\nBowl - I used the XL version of this bowl:\nhttps://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3392930\n\n\n#### ❧ Brush Notes\n*^(Zenith - B10 Boar Red ‹9 uses›)*\n\nI'm starting to think that the super soft tips on this brush just aren't picking up as much soap as other boars do in my rotation.\n\nTomorrow's test may shed some light on that. I plan to duplicate today's shave, but not puck-load. I'll scoop 1/4 tsp out and have a go at it. If I end up with a great lather, then I think we can say that this brush doesn't pick up soap as well as others, and just needs more time on the puck.\n\n#### ❧ Shave Quality\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Cut flush to where I just see the tips (above average for me)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm)\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

I mean, the amount of soaps and brushes and razors and bourbon and scotch I can get for the money. I have zero issue with the prices charged for a handmade item considering the time it takes, just wasn't where i personally chose to spend my dollar. Curiosity finally got the better of me and I picked one up as I was in the right place at the right time, fully expecting to use it a few times, say been there done that, and unload it.....Yeah. I was WRONG.\n\nI was pretty happy with the Silksmoke for a while, but it just got to, I don't know, soft. Like lathering with a cotton ball. I then picked up a Black Synthetic, which I do really like, but I realized, maybe I was just after something I wasn't going to find in a Synthetic, so I went back to my fairly well broken in Stirling Finest and have been perfectly happy with that. However, using the B7, I realize, it's flat out everything I was looking for. The tips are soft, it's doesn't have too much scrub, and it has just the right amount of backbone. For me.",

WTG, XTG, Clean up. My first stroke with the razor was surprising. Aggressive. Soap was decent but I had a higher expectation. Great brush as always. Nice post shave.\n\n**The Soap** was decent. It worked up a good lather and had a good performance. Average slickness and protection. I've heard some raving reviews about Catie's Bubbles so I was excited to test them out. For me, they perform similar to Razorock and I think it's because they lack the animal fat. For Vegan soaps, they work great but I still prefer the fatty lather. The scent is clean and has hints of marine notes. Clean linen smell + Salty sea smell in the background. Light and a daily-use soap for me.\n\n**The Razor and Blade** combination was efficient and aggressive. If I did a three pass, I probably would have gotten some irritation. The razor has fair bit of blade gap and aggressive open comb teeth. Definitely not a daily razor but I'll use it with another blade to reduce the stubbles. The blade is as I thought: Sharp but not smooth enough. It's almost to a point of irritation but not quite there. I might use it with milder razors because pairing it with aggressive razor can be unenjoyable.\n\n**The Brush** still remains as one of my favorite. Great boar brush that's broken in fair bit. It's soft but still has enough scritch to exfoliate the skin. It was a pleasure using the brush. It doesn't hold the lather as well as synthetics but I load heavy to compensate for that.\n\n**The aftershave portion** was great. I'm slowly getting used to the smell of Humidor although it smells a tad bit too strong for my taste. The Ice Cold Balm is amazing. I've been using it everyday and it continues to perform excellently. Great post shave.\n\nOverall, an efficient but a little uncomfortable shave. I cannot use the Old Type too often but I'll reserve it for heavier stubbles. Also, I'll switch the blade to something smoother; maybe Astra or Voshkod. Lastly, the soap was good so it'll be a part of my rotation. I probably will not pair it up with aggressive razors as I do like the additional tallow slickness I get from Fatty lathers.",

Not great but not bad either. I've been struggling building up a good lather recently and so I decided I'd give face lathering a shot. I started shaving with what I thought was a nice, smooth, slick lather, but in fact it was still too dry. I was able to go back and add some water though, which turned out to be exactly what I needed. As for the blade, I think it was too mild for me. The blade was having a hard time passing over the hair on my chin, but after 3 passes gave me an acceptable shave. It's been hard for me to figure out if I want a sharper blade with a higher risk of irritation but a closer shave, or a more mild blade that I'll have to work at getting a good shave with potentially less irritation. I've narrowed my blade sampler down to the 8 or 9 blade I've enjoyed the most, so hopefully I can continue to narrow it further with the upcoming shaves.",

I'm switching over to night shifts so my morning shave today is when I'm usually having dinner. On the topic of dinner, I had some Tri-tip tacos yesterday and I made some killer jalapeño-cucumber margaritas to go with. One thing I did not plan for was ventilation while I was making my jalapeño infused simple syrup. I was coughing up a storm as the capsaicin infused sugar water was steaming. If anyone is interested in the recipe I'll post it upon request.\n\nSo my shave today was King of Bourbon. I've been looking for a good, boozy soap for the last few weeks. I considered Catie's Bubbles \"Porch Drinks\", Henri et. Victoria \"Cognac & Cuban Cigars\", Stirling \"Gin & Tonic\", Declaration Grooming \"Bon Vivant\" and Wholly Kaw \"King of Bourbon\".\n\n\"King of Bourbon\" is awesome. Great lather as you would expect from Wholly Kaw and the smell is out of this world. I have a pretty well stocked liquor shelf and I'm partial to Rye, Scotch and Bourbon. \"King of Bourbon\" smells like a Bourbon. Vanilla is strong as you would find in an Oak barrel. There's some sweetness in the scent, but it's not overpowering and it reminds me of older bourbons that have some age to them and the bright, sharp sweetness from new mash has been smoothed by time. The middle of the soap has tobacco notes that I find more often in Elijah Craig's older offerings like the 18. This is a 5/5 scent for me, up there with \"Ghost Town Barber\" and \"Seville\".\n\nI'm constantly rotating through soaps because I like new jars to photograph and there's only a few that stay on my self consistently, but \"King of Bourbon\" will be sticking around for a long time.\n\nSpeaking of photography, what soaps do you think have the most aesthetically pleasing labels? I'm digging the B&M reserve line like Fern with its clean looks. Noble Otter also has a really uniformed theme that carries through on each label. That's good graphic design and product planning on their part (in my opinion). At some point I want to get some Night Music as well as some Fougère Gothique because I can imagine scenes that would compliment both labels.\n\nHave a good Sunday!",

It was one of the first shave soaps I had and it's easy to forget about it with exploring all the different artisan soaps out there. It still performs great, it lathered really well and provides plenty of cushion. The balm on the other hand is a slightly different story, it feels great now that I've got it on and worked in but it took so long to work in, I swear at one point it looked like it was lathering up itself!",

This is the 4th shave as I've tried to figure out why 3 shaves ago, I botched the lather. Thought it was the water, but tonight I proved it was this super-smooth and soft boar from Zenith. It is so soft that it takes longer when brush loading to gather up enough soap for the shave. Wasn't really the water as it turns out.\n\nFace felt so great, skipped the post shave.\n\n#### ❧ Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Karve - Christopher Bradley A Plate ::: Feather ‹26 uses›)*\n\nI love this razor. Felt like a comfy shave, so I reached for the A plate. Stuck a Feather in it and it delivered. So comfortable.\n\nNo tugging or hint of irritation.\n\n#### ❧ Soap Notes\n*^(Stirling - Stirling for Him)*\n\nLather much more plentiful than the brush-load yesterday.\n\n1/4 tsp soap + lightly-wet brush + 3 tsp water = 5-6 passes of slick, creamy, sheeny, elastic lather.\n\nScent: a nice light cologne scent. I like it. Patterned after Versace Pour Homme\n\nScent Strength: 3-4/10, lightly present during shaving.\n\nBowl - I used the XL version of this bowl:\nhttps://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3392930\n\n\n#### ❧ Brush Notes\n*^(Zenith - B10 Boar Red ‹10 uses›)*\n\nSo these tips are crazy soft. Gives great feel on the face, but that also turns out to mean that there's less soap pickup. I may have to load for 50-60 seconds with this brush when all my others just need 30! Small price to pay for glorious comfort, I say.\n\nStill am soaking the boars for a few hours prior to shaves, since they're so young.\n\n#### ❧ Shave Quality\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Cut flush to where I just see the tips (above average for me)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm)\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

I made a decision that in order to expand my den, it needs to add diversity, mostly by brand. I'm thinking I'll need to replace this set once I kill it, and that should happen soon before the drop, with any luck. I only have one other set from SS but I'm kinda trying to peddle it. Or I buy into the ashes set as I have nothing from Southern Witchcraft at the moment. As for the last one from B&M, I have so much of their product that from that standpoint I can't entertain yet another one in my backup supply.\n\nLife is short, shave with good gear.\n",

This is clearly a different recipe, or at least percentages, since the original Veritas is still real gooey in my closet.\n\nForgetting all the BS surrounding the company and specifically this base/soap, I saw Ruds gave this a 96 ShaveScore (tm?) the other day, so my curiosity was again piqued as it was when I originally bought this (how long ago was that at this point?)\n\nSummary: Meh. Don't get me wrong. My face is really soft. The soap was very slick. The guy can clearly soap. I think the meh comes from the scent. It's OK, but nothing is blowing me away. I think I told someone it was cardboardy, but that's not really right. Just the way the cocoa/leather/tobacco come together are very uninspiring. Very forgettable.\n\nThis soap made me realize, i'd rather a great scent, than a great soap. Obviously, having both is the great white whale (Seville in Reserve is probably the closest that gets there for me). But, i'd rather use Ghost Town Barber, or History 101 which (to me) smell great, and are great but maybe not exceptional soaps. I guess that's why the Declaration soaps with Chatillon Lux scents are so highly regarded.\n\nI was much more impressed the other day with what Southern Witchcrafts was able to do without Tallow as what Grooming Dept did with this base, to be honest. In any case, it's a slick soap that made my face feel soft, so i'll keep it and use it again....",

I love the Big Fellow handle, but never liked the head much. The razor I wanted sold quick, but it still planted the seed for today's shave. I used my center punch handle, which mimics the Big Fellow/Big Boy handle in weight, length, diameter, and knurling.\n\nIt was a better shave than I remember, but nowhere near what would have justified the purchase. I don't hate it as much anymore, but I can't see me reaching for it when my Old Type Big Fellow, NEW De Luxe, or RFB are within reach.\n\nMy Dollar Tree Arctic Blue has a decent amount of menthol. I can't remember if I spiked it, or it's au naturel. I'll have to check my archived posts at work tomorrow.\n\nNothing planned today other than maybe try to read Frank Herbert's magnum opus Dune yet again. I've bounced off this book one or two times in the past 30+ years, but like shaving, my tastes change.",

I still didn't achieve the kind of lather Ruds was shaving with after face lathering. I'll keep at it. The lather was plenty slick but just didn't have that post shave feel that I enjoy with some other artisans. This might not matter in the summer. For what it's worth I got a good shave from the lather.",

WTG, XTG, Clean up. I didn't know that the Lucky Tiger shave cream worked well. A pleasant surprise. Brush felt good and aftershave was mild and did its job.\n\n**The Soap** was a surprise. I thought it would be more of a brushless cream and that it would disappoint me. I was wrong. It gave me a great lather and a slick one as well. I did have a thinner lather towards the second and third pass but I might have put too much water. Maybe I'll load a bit more next time. The scent is same as the splash: a orange, zesty, tangerine, citrus smell. I really enjoy the splash so I enjoyed this one as well. The scent is pretty light so it goes away after the shave.\n\n**The Razor and Blade** combination was great. It felt a little less aggressive this time. Maybe it's me getting used to it or the blade shimming down a tiny bit. Anyhow, I really enjoyed the combo today. But because I didn't go ATG, I did have a tiny bit of 5'o clock shadow. Not the cleanest of shaves but I works for me on an average day. I do miss the BBS shaves but I've been shaving daily so a BBS will easily give me irritation. Nope, not today.\n\n**The Brush** worked well today. It is scritchy as always but it gives a good exfoliation for my face. I'm continuing to use it in hopes that it'll soften through the months of use. I probably shouldn't have paired it with an aggressive razor so I'll change that up next time.\n\n**The aftershave portion** was great. I do love Lucky Tiger products and every single one of them performs well. The moisturizer does have a sunscreen-like smell but it does its job. I was left with a well moisturized face and I'm happy with that.\n\nOverall, a great shave. I was pleased with all of the products and felt great afterwards. Only thing is that I would have preferred a BBS shave but given the daily shave, I couldn't. Next time, I'll try the classic three pass shave with more time for my skin to heal.",

It is super smooth and gets about as close as the C plate I use alot. I feel that the B plate, for me, could definitely be a daily driver. I can use the C daily as well, but I think that I will use it when I have a few day's growth.\n\nAnyway, great shave today and happy it's Sunday.\n\nHappy Shaves Y'all!",

I had a great trade with him. Unfortunately I couldn't get my half of the trade out to him until Saturday so I threw in a sample of Hollows by way of an apology. This puck of Cryogen is the old label with the DNA strand. I've used this soap once before and to put it in perspective how chock full of menthol this soap is, when I opened the lid, there was [menthol crystals](https://i.imgur.com/Xl2lbLP.jpg) that had formed on the surface.\n\n​\n\nWithin seconds of whipping up the lather in my bowl and applying it, my eyes began to water and my face felt like it had been dunked in a bucket of ice water. Any remnants of sleep instantly vanished. I always wet my razor between passes with hot water, but feeling like a masochist, I choose to use cold water instead. My steel Rockwell was freezing cold but I could barely feel a difference thanks to the Cryogen. I thought that my face might adapt slightly to the menthol by the time the second pass came about. Nope, still freezing cold. My wife walked in at that point and asked if I was using vicks vapor rub.\n\n​\n\nI contemplated a third pass wondering where I had gone wrong in my life to reach this point. It probably started when I purchased a [MMMBop single](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHozn0YXAeE&pbjreload=10) at the age of 13. I was totally awake at that point, the menthol had done its job. I looked down at the bottle of aftershave and frowned. *\"Do I really want to do this?\"* I thought before opening up the aftershave and got mauled by a yeti.\n\n​\n\nAll jokes aside, Cryogen is the king of menthol soaps. There's nothing more pure and undiluted out there to my knowledge. Just like when Ron Swanson states that he wants [\"all the eggs and bacon\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DleceyAO34M), Cryogen is all the menthol. Its glorious and unapologetic. I love it and everyone should try it at least once.\n\n​\n\nHave a great Monday!\n\n​",

Stropped about 50 times before the shave and did a WTG pass followed by XTG/ATG. Ran into a little chatter going up the neck, so I backed off and switched to the DE. The only weepers were from the DE, so overall it was a great shave. Stropping went better than I thought it would, didn't take long to get used to the motion and find a rhythm. Do people recommend a second straight to alternate right away or is it fine to keep using the same? I know, buy them all, but I'm talking strictly from a performance perspective.",

Have another tub of Stirling Barbershop that I hope has a stronger scent. It did.\n\n#### ❧ Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Wolfman - WR1 Open Comb .61 Polished ::: Feather ‹27 uses›)*\n\nWonderful piece. Nice close shave.\n\nNo tugging or irritation.\n\n#### ❧ Soap Notes\n*^(Stirling - Barbershop)*\n\nWonderful performance, as usual from Stirling. Today, I brush-loaded from puck.\n\n**brush load:** 40 sec load with lightly-wet, boar brush + 4.5 tsp water = 5-6 passes of nicely slick lather, still in the enjoyable range, but a bit wet. To make it more creamy, I just dried my face before applying the pass' lather.\n\n**measured:** 1/4+ tsp measured and whipped up with lightly-wet, boar brush + 3.5 tsp water = 5 passes of nicely slick lather. Just enough to give me some margin to screw up, just in case.\n\nScent: I like the scent coming from the dry puck, and the same version coming from the lather bowl. A fairly traditional barbershop that I could use an enjoy every day for a long time.\n\nScent Strength: 4-5/10, lightly present during shaving.\n\nBowl - I used the XL version of this bowl:\nhttps://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3392930\n\n\n#### ❧ Brush Notes\n*^(Semogue - 1800 Boar ‹8 uses›)*\n\nA little backbone in the right way, but mostly soft tips and a very comfy shave. Soaked for 45 mins before shave as break in.\n\n#### ❧ Shave Quality\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Cut flush to where I just see the tips (above average for me)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm)\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

Like, six out of five stars. I had heard of \"riding the cap\" before but didn't realize until today how far I needed to change up my angle to get into that zone... Acting on a tip I ran into on W_E, I started on the top cap and tilted down until the blade engaged, rather than starting on the safety bar and tilting up until the blade engaged. Logical, no? Anyway, ho lee fuck. Less skin-scrapey, less tuggy (actually, no tugging anywhere except ATG on my chin and upper lip), and the shave was closer with less work. A little awkward to wield the razor at that angle in a few spots, but well worth the effort.\n\nWhen I was testing my German Wilkinson Sword blades I found that they started getting unpleasantly tuggy after about 10 shaves for me, so I wanted to take this blade to at least the same point to see how it compared. I'm pretty sure the Wilkinsons started out sharper fresh out of the box... but this Astra is delivering considerably better performance 10 shaves in. I see absolutely no reason to retire this blade yet. Considering that it is: still shaving closer, more comfortable, lasting longer, and cheaper, I'd say that Astra is the far more suitable blade for me.\n\nWas supposed to hit the road with my project manager today for a 1,300 km road trip to tour some of the stores we renovated over the past year, but we both caught a cold and had to take a sick day instead. Maybe we'll go next week instead.",

On another note, I've gotten rid of most of my brushes over the past couple of months. I'm down to one badger, one boar (both SOC), and a synthetic. I'm thinking of getting rid of the natural brushes and just sticking with the synthetic. I like them all, but the synthetic is just so much easier. I don't know; we'll see.",

The snow could be heavy at times. High near 36. North wind 10 to 15 mph becoming northwest in the afternoon. Chance of precipitation is 90%. Total daytime snow accumulation of 1 to 3 inches possible. High tide at 10:26 tonight.\n\nBrush Lathers: 32\n\nUp at 4:30 to go out and snow blow so the neighbor could get out of the driveway to get to work. Got back in to find out the Small One has a Snow Day. While there is still some snow coming down I don't think I will have to get the snow blower out again. Wanted to stick with the Bison base, but a different scent. Cuir et Epices just seems to fit with the weather. Overloaded a bit and was flinging lather all over the bathroom counter, but still a great lather, and shave.\n\nHave nice Monday everyone!",

Looks nice, but gets quite slippery with even minimal water (or, God forbid, soap) on it. Good shave nonetheless, but the CG 100mm Torpedo handle is soooo much better in balance and grippiness... The plaid was (is?) much cheaper though.\n* Soap: Third iteration of the scent that I own - Black Label, Glissant, and now Excelsior. An amazing scent, and Excelsior finally puts the great scent in a first rate base.\n* Frag: This costly Tom Ford scent complements Beaudelaire well. B&M was first with the design though...",

I'm slowly getting into frags since my wife has a very sensitive nose and tends to get headaches easily with strong scents. A single spray is good enough for me and light enough to enjoy. I wished I could have smell it a bit more during my commute this morning but I had to bundle up with temps of 0 and a windchill of -20.",

I'm beginning to trust the feel of the blade as my guide but still keeping it to WTG on the cheeks and flirting with the upper lip and chin. I'm really appreciating the required focus as part of my mindful shaving experience. Finished up with the Black Beauty. I like this razor. It moves around so easily and I think it's very mild, even when cranked [up to 11](https://imgur.com/a/uJnSDwm)\n\n\nI finally got around to my Bergamot Lavender sample from Stirling. I'm always so pleased with how much fragrance is released when I remove the plastic. The Lavender and citrus are very complimentary and one doesn't seem to overpower the other. I'm beginning to remove some product with a small spatula and load from a dedicated loading bowl. The SOC is quite soft and takes some work to pick up the soap. During my face lather I could detect some spice and some floral notes. Don't know if it was just me but I felt a warming sensation that made me anxious for spring. The soap performs very well as I'm used to seeing from Stirling. The slickness really helps as I continue to learn on the shavette. Post shave was very smooth and the lavender sticks around for a while. I've got some unscented balm on the way from Stirling and look forward to having some post shave that doesn't step on my residual lather scents.\n\nSo begins another busy week. I only have three Monday classes left this semester and look forward to not working so early to compensate.\n\nKeep marching and have a great week.",

The 24mm synth really gets a good lather going easily.\n\nAstra SP was smooth yet again. I'm really enjoying the sharpness of the blade without it being too harsh on my skin. Not a single nick, which I'm happy about, as it shows I'm getting my technique sorted out.\n\nNo BBS on the neck but it is what it is. I was tempted to do another pass (4th) but decide against it. Might try for a back to back shave today to see how the skin feels about that.\n\nHave a good Monday!",

I'm still adjusting to the little handle, but it's coming along. I think this handle will be good for the LVL3 plate. I was going to use it this morning, but was a little rushed for time and didn't want to rush the shave. I've only used that plate once or twice, but I remember it feeling fairly aggy, so I want to take my time with it. Maybe tomorrow.\n\nDFS for me today. It's raining again today, I want to complain lol but we need it here!\n\nHope everyone had a great weekend and today isn't too harsh!\n=)",

I got off work at 6am this morning and then I went to sleep. I woke up around four pm and I didn't get around to shaving until after I put my kids down to sleep by 9pm. It's midnight here and I'm going to be taking a nap soon since I'm transitioning back onto a day time schedule. In summary, it's a mess.\n\nAs I said, I put my kids down to sleep and grabbed my Ghost Town Barber. For anyone that's wondering, on my days off I will take a bunch of these photos and end up having planned shaves. For example, I knew I would end up using GTB this week, I just had no idea when. In a way, I like it because it makes sure that I'm using all of my soaps and not favoring any single one. Anyhow, Ghost Town Barber was one of the first soaps I found coming into wetshaving. My first soap was actually some Maggards London Barbershop and I loved the Barbershop scent profile. In a four month period I ended up getting five or six different barbershop soaps to check out and GTB became one of my favorites. The scent is a mix of clean and smokey. It's really fantastic and having gone through nearly a whole puck of it, I find it very comforting. My only regret about GTB is that the base is not quite as good as Icarus, Reserve or Wholly Kaw. Don't get me wrong, it's still a great soap and performs well, but The lather is a hair less rich than the above named bases.\n\nI have a question for /r/WetShaving for the married guys. What do your wives think of this hobby? This morning my wife asked me to mix some lather for her since she wanted something floral for shaving her legs. She ended up choosing my sample of B&M Reserve Lavender and really liking it. This was her first time asking about wetshaving. Have you guys had your wives go down the wetshaving rabbit hole?\n\nIn other news I posed on /r/Shave_Bazaar that I was looking for some Fougère Gothique. I wont hold my breath, but it would be cool to get some. I've also been talking to Rudy Vey about a project. My father worked for years up in Alaska and after he passed a few years ago I came into possession of some [pre-ban Walrus](https://i.imgur.com/sLqkvS7.jpg) that he owned. I've given some thought to it and the idea of it sitting on my shelf and collecting dust seems odd to me. Better for it to be used on a daily basis. We are discussing a custom brush handle. The diameter is fairly small at 1.5 around so we will see. Has anyone here worked with Rudy before? Or have some advice on design? Everyone on Badger and Blade have nothing but good things to say about him and I have no doubt he would do an amazing job within the limits of the material.\n\nAnyhow, let me know what y'all think and have a great Tuesday!",

I'm really pleased with their appearance. The knot is amazingly soft but still has some backbone. I'm still working on scooping and sorting out the needed volume. I overloaded a bit since I've been on natural knots for a while. The brush feels as smooth as running an alum block on the face. Zero scritchy so if you like a scrub, this brush won't help. I enjoyed it.\n\n\"If Lavender had a peel, this is what it would smell like. Spicy, sweet, floral, and most definitely unique.\" The Stirling starts to look so beautiful even before it's ready and I bet a lot of folks stop early with their hydration. Put more water until you really see that sheen on your face. This florals in this scent are starting to stand out on my second day using it. Still very pleasant.\n\nGetting more comfortable with the Shavette every day. I'm still shying away from the point of my chin and only going WTG. I'm really enjoying the learning process. Every once in a while I have to stop and say, nope. Don't do that. But progressing nicely. Great relaxing shave today.\n\nKeep Marching\n",

Other than one mistake, all user error, that gave me a little cut on my upper cheek, it was a great shave. I think a few uses and some extra stropping helped make the razor smoother than when I first used it. I still have difficulty going around my goatee, but I'm sure I will figure out the proper angles after awhile.\n\nKing of Oud is a terrific scent, and made a terrifically slick lather. A very complex scent, I get mostly the earthy wood notes and maybe some vetiver with the spices. I found the Proraso Sandalwood matched very well as a post. Stirling Agar is a good match as well. I do not like the initial smokiness to the fragrance, but that diminishes right after spraying. The strength is very weak on the scent and doesn't last very long for me, but I do like it enough to add the scent to my list of Stirling soap and aftershave to pick up down the road.",

I was not disappointed. The black tea and bergamot scents lead strong with the jasmine, vanilla, and strawberry slowly working their way into the mix. Good scent strength without being overpowering both off the puck and through lathering. Good performance and good post shave feel. Glad I picked this up.",

I picked it up on a whim since it's my birth year razor, and I was kind of looking for one, but kind of not either. I'm glad I picked it up as this one is in really good shape for being 35 years old (better shape than me!), and a steal at the price.\n\nI have to say, compared to my R41 daily driver, this thing is super mild. You would have to try and cut yourself on purpose with this thing. But, with that said, I can see why this was the most popular razor for decades. You can shave on auto pilot with no worry of nicks or cuts. I didn't get the closest shave, but I chalk that up to not being used to a mild razor. I'll definitely give this thing a lot more uses to iron out the kinks.",

Not too much skin irritation or harsh feel from the blade. However, my skin felt pretty dry this morning so had to apply a little moisturizer.\n\nFace lather again resulted in a slick, smooth paste. I kept adding water until there was smooth lather. Stirling really is easy to work with.\n\nFace is very close to BBS but my neck isn't - I'm starting to think the pre-shave prep makes a difference here. Gotta get back to shaving after hot showers.",

The Excelsior base is great, excellent post shave feel. I underhydrated the lather a bit, it's definitely a thirty soap. The scent is great as well. To me, it's Christmas right off of the puck. Then it becomes more complex during the lather and post shave.\n\nAlso, ordered a Karve OC last week. Excited to try a new razor.",

The aftershave is from an up and coming company I discovered on one of the FB groups. It's very good stuff. A nice balance of alcohol and witch hazel, so you get the alcohol feel, but with very little burn. All the scent components are natural. This one is simple, with only cedar, sandalwood, and lavender. It's a lovely, fresh, woody scent. Totally worth checking out.",

Every time I've written \"Nebraska soap\" for the last couple of weeks, I've been referring to my Summer Break Soaps bath/shampoo bar in their upcoming Bell Ringer scent. First off, Bell Ringer is a great scent. It's bright, sweet and fruity in an almost bubble gum kind of way. If your US History teacher catches you with Bell Ringer during class, first he's going to ask if you brought enough for the whole class, then he's going to make you spit it out and give up the pack. Luckily he doesn't know that you've got another pack in your backpack just in case. As for the performance of the soap, it certainly seems to have sufficient moisturizers and skin foods to keep my disturbingly dry skin fairly happy in this dry winter air. Highly recommended, five stars.",

I've been sticking with my promise to cut down my shave den and have used only Barrister's Reserve soaps and Creed decants for the last few weeks. I'm really appreciating the simplicity.

Smellin like a suave and hairy chested gent from the 80s, leggo!\n\nFor those who don't know the original M7 was an early Tom Ford foray in a \"new to the west\" scent note called Oud (he was a young tyke at YSL at the time, and part of a major revival of that brand). It's a known beast mode performer.\n\nFrequently used in the east, particularly in the Middle East and India, Oud has become pretty mainstream over the last few years. It's a fairly expensive ingredient too.\n\nIt's part of Unconditional Surrender too, noted as Agar wood.\n\n**//Brush**\n\nThis brush is breaking in nicely and is probably the one with most backbone in my collection. It dug into the soap pretty good and created that bison Tallow marshmallowyness it's known for. I used to get anxiety over lathering this stuff, but some practice with it has made it a dream to use.\n\nHappy Tuesday folks!\n\n",

I know many swear by them after the tips split and it stops eating 13 metric tons of lather, so I'd like to see if I experience the same euphoria. For now, trying to get used to the ritual soaking and massive soap overloading that will become my future. I guess if nothing else, I may actually make a reasonable dent in my soaps for a change.\n\nPurchased the MR11 on sale for ten bucks and I would gladly have paid a lot more. The knurling is so grippy, and the length and weight suit my preferences to a t. The contrast of the blue to the razor heads in my collection is also [very nice](\nhttps://m.imgur.com/gallery/lqKlotB)\n\nDone with my exam i pulled an all nighter for, and my reward is work later in the evening. Ah well, at least the shave was good. Happy Tuesday!\n\n\n\n\n",

A good cutter, but really comfortable.\n\nNo tugging or irritation.\n\n#### ❧ Soap Notes\n*^(Ballenclaugh - Honey & Tobacco)*\n\nBallenclaugh has a great base. This one seems to work better if I don't mix it quite as wet as I usually do. I had it finally tweaked perfectly and got that creamy slickness I like.\n\n30 second load with lightly-wet, prickly, higher-backbone boar brush + 3.5 tsp water = 5-6 passes of really nice, beautiful slick lather.\n\nScent: got the sweetness of the honey more when it was dry. Tobacco scent was very enjoyable and nothing like an ashtray. Great scent combo, IMO.\n\nScent Strength: 4/10, lightly present during shaving.\n\nBowl - I used the XL version of this bowl:\nhttps://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3392930\n\n\n#### ❧ Brush Notes\n*^(Omega - 10098 Boar ‹9 uses›)*\n\nIt's coming along slowly, which is fine. Not yet comfy.

Pairing it with my EJ Kelvin handle until I decide what handle to buy for it. Likely to be the matte iKon Bulldog handle or one of the WCS SS handles since they look to have a slightly less polished look to them.\n\nGood CCS shave overall. Ended up with a couple neck hairs this morning that needed to be tweezed out, but that seems to be pretty normal these days. Biggest factor for me was zero irritation after my last shave. Neck is healing up nicely and I'm excited to see how this razor works out for me in the long run.\n\nWashing my face pre-shave seems to be helping soften up the beard some. At the very least the soap I'm using seems to do more than water only or my lame attempts at a hot towel.",

But I also wanted some variety so I plucked the Absolutely splash from my big drawer of samples. It's a nice scent, just enough menthol to give that tingle I like. The dry down reminds me a bit of B&M Reserve Classic. Felt a little red/splotchy on application (probably need to replace my blade), but it calmed down quick and left my skin feeling very soft/moisturized. Haven't used the Stubble Buster soaps yet but the splashes are a great value.",

The nice aspect is with all the blade feel, I still didn't get the impending fear of it biting me. At all. I like aggy razors, not sure I like this one though. Maybe a bit too aggy for daily use, which is probably why it's been sitting in the box while I use the LVL2 DC plate.\nDue to the amount of blade feel, I decided to forego the third pass. It's late, I don't need a clean shave, and I want to shave in the morning too, so two passes it is!\n\nDFS with 2 passes today, with LOTS of blade presence. If you like blade feel, this is a great option!\n\nHope everyone day was a good one!",

It didn't take that long nor did I get irritation from it. I did a two pass + clean up. WTG, XTG/ATG, Clean up. Feeling my face in the late afternoon and still can't feel any stubble. Speechless.\n\n**The Soap** was great. It lathered up quickly and made a creamy and yogurt-like lather on my face. The scent is pretty good; It started a bit off but I'm enjoying the Old Spice inspired scent more as the shave goes on. Good slickness and performance. It is a Vegan soap but the Shea Butter really helps it tone down into the creamy goodness. Overall, a great soap to work with.\n\n**The Razor and Blade** combination was none other than excellent. I'm starting to understand why some people think the Old Type is the greatest razor of all times. It mows down the stubbles effortlessly and didn't give me any irritation. If I overbuffed some areas, it definitely can give me irritation but I purposely did not do so. I made sure I had lather where I was shaving and ended up with a clean BBS face. Good blade as well. It was a bit rougher in the first shave but now, it's working as it should.\n\n**The Brush** was very nice. One of the softest brush that I have. It has some backbone but not to the point of discomfort. It splays out beautifully and shows some resistance as a synthetic brush but it's still a pleasure to use. I'm beginning to enjoy it more.\n\n**The aftershave portion** was great. Light Witch Hazel matched with a Ice-Kicking aftershave balm. Brhhhhhhh!!! I immediately felt the chill all across my face and I loved it! It's one of my favorite product and it's perfect for all the menthol heads out there.\n\nOverall, one of the best shaves I ever had. I enjoyed every single product I used today and came out with a BBS and No-Irritation shave. I'll continue to experiment with the soaps I got from mail call. Next in the chopping block will be Piacenza from Stirling. Excited!",

Very enjoyable it's has less blade feel then I was expecting. A great first shave. At the moment I feel like it has characteristics of both the D and the E SB plates. I think tomorrow I will to a side by side shave with the D Open comb and the D safety bar. Followed up by a D OC VS a E SB the next shave.",

Woody, spicy and deep. I know this is a seasonal fall release, but I think of it like an Oriental scent. It's a great evening shave soap to use before going out with the wife. I wear some D&G \"The One\" EdP with it. Just a perfect pair. I won't even talk about Icarus. It's an amazing soap base. Right up there with Reserve and Donkey Milk.\n\nI ah... well I fell into the rabbit hole today in a big way. I sold one of my watches recently and today I invested some of the cash into more soaps and aftershaves. I was able to get quite a few out of production or limited editions soaps. There was some really good stuff. I'll have lots of products to photograph in over the next month.\n\nHave a good Wednesday!",

Though the C plate is mild for me, it is still very efficient and doesn't leave me wanting more. The Wizamet remains sharp with no tugging. Finally got around to trying a sample of this soap, and I quite enjoyed the scent. The sample was softer than my other DG bison, but lathered just as easy. The Fresh Vetiver and Habit Rouge complimented the vetiver and citrus from the soap very nicely.",

I'm not educated on most of the nuances, but I found what works for me, and it gets the seal of approval from the wife, so I'm happy. Been working like a dog, and soft considering a career change, but it's likely not going to happen, since relocation would be mandatory. Got into watches and spent way too much, but I'm happy and that's what counts, right? Hope y'all are having fun!",

It's just a pleasant, non masculine scent.. I would say it's unisex.\n\nOverall their soaps lather up nice and give\nMe good shaves!",

All I know is [it was a tough shave](https://i.imgur.com/N35abzk.gifv).\n\n\nThe scuttle is [awesome](https://i.imgur.com/ZpztKxX.gifv).\n\n\n**The song:** It's not an amazing song, but I know some people like to write off Les Claypool as a good bassist. This song is a perfect example of how he can support the guitarist, but also play a lead line with the same lick.\n\n\nEarly Primus is also awesome, but I think the *Brown Album* is their first honest attempt at making songs people want to hear. The whole thing is listenable from start to finish, in part because it doesn't have anything in there like [this](https://youtu.be/c9SWonLDO_Y) (which is awesome in a different way).\n\n\nGreat shaves, all!",

I noticed that there were hardly any pricks when lathering. There is still an element of scrub, but it is leaps and bounds better than when it first saw use.\n\nSoap Uses: 2\nGoing to try to remember to keep a count, starting yesterday, to see how many shaves I can get out of this tub. While this won't be a perfect count because I got this tub used and have used it several times before yesterday. Was a better lather this morning, but the first pass could have used more water worked in as it was a bit pasty.\n\nOverall a nice shave, but lather could use some work.\n\nHave a nice Wednesday everyone!",

R. Harris - Arlington Aftershave\n**Fragrance:** Brut EdT\n\nI was finally able to try Williams thanks to the generosity of a fella from the SERF group on FB. Couldn't pass up the opportunity for my very first William Wednesday, now could I? The performance of the soap itself is very basic. It gets the job done without overly drying my face. I felt a bit of tightness in the post shave, but that's not unusual for me with most soaps. The scent of the soap was very surprising to me to say the least. It felt like I got smacked in the face with a citronella candle when I opened the box but it faded rather quickly and I only caught hints of it during the actual shave itself. It got the job done and gives me a reason to keep my eyes open for an Old Spice mug when I'm out and about. Still just haven't found one in the wild for a reasonable price. Oh well. No rush.\n\nAs for the D. R. Harris, I received it in a trade that I misunderstood and have held off using it because of that. Just hadn't decided if I wanted to keep it or not. Well, after using it, I'll say I enjoyed the bright citrus pop that faded away to nothing much rather quickly as well. So, since I've used the Williams and got that blast from the past, I decided on Brut to round everything off and I enjoyed it as always.",

And also thrice the price and barely available, at least at present. Ah, sad dilemma! This blade is perfect for the Timeless 0.68, which definitely likes sharper blades.\n* **Soap Impressions**: Technicals are great - base is straddling first tier, surpassing Caties and Noble Otter, running neck in neck with Wholly Kaw (especially given the relative pricing) and just a tad lower than Reserve and Eufros, Impressive for a newcomer company, though perhaps not so much given the opportunity to reverse engineer so many fine bases now available.\n* Labeling resembles B&M Leviathan all too closely, Yes, the ouroboros image is not IP, but still...\n* Scent: Lots of incense and amber - similar to Declaration Harmony but with more amber and a hint of patchouli. Pleasant design, but I'd call it medium scent strength rather than the \"strong\" classification on the makers site.\n* Value: Exceptional - 5.5 ounces of A- grade soap for $17! An impressive calling card to introduce the brand, though better packaging and more innovation will be needed to elevate the brand to the top tier.\n* **Frag:** Incense and vetiver, good match for the soap, and a nice somber note for Ash Wednesday!",

Feather still cranking out the great cuts.\n\nNo tugging or irritation.\n\n#### ❧ Soap Notes\n*^(Wholly Kaw - Project Leather - Tallow)*\n\nWe all know this soap is superb. No change there.\n\n1/4 tsp soap + lightly-wet brush + 2.5 tsp water = 5-6 passes of creamy slick lather, which did prefer it if I left just a little water on my face after the rinse.\n\nScent: dry, it was like anise. But that backed off when in lather form. Maybe the leather and oud were the dominate notes. I think I like it. Manly, for sure.\n\nScent Strength: 5/10, present during shaving.\n\nBowl - I used the XL version of this bowl:\nhttps://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3392930\n\n\n#### ❧ Brush Notes\n*^(Semogue - 1305 Boar ‹9 uses›)*\n\nSuch a great brush. no scritch.

The Black Beauty is a great shaver and mild enough for hauling ass.\n\nI felt like smelling of a man today so I broke out the Siliski that was a PIF from u/MadDingersYo and was my intro into patchouli. I had an association of patchouli with hippies and this soap broke my aversion. Super easy lather and a mild fresh scent. I had a tiny bit of lavender left in my bowl and that might have added a little brightness.\n\nFrom the vendor: \"Masculine Musk: A clean, masculine musk that somehow manages to be fresh and phenomenally sexy at the same time. What sets this one apart? The topnote is accented with a little-known Indonesian essential oil called \"jatamansi,\" which adds mystery to the blend, and bottom notes of sandalwood, patchouli, and amber boost its staying power.\"\n\nGood shave. Good day.\n",

It works really well for me, because I don't have all that much growth in a day. Timeless Ti 2, Game Changer .84, and Charcoal Dual Comb Lvl 1 are the other razors in my current rotation. I pulled the trigger on the OC B plate cuz...well I have a disorder like most people here 😬 - I have all the Karve plates in standard safety bar form. Only the B plate in OC.\n\nThe open comb has a tad more blade feel and is also slightly more efficient than the SB, without feeling unsafe at all. It took a little less buffing / cleanup to get to BBS, something I care about but others may not. The rake lines that OC razors produce are clear and present in the lather - I've not figured out how that affects the shave. I could see this replacing the SB for daily with no problem. If you prefer no blade feel, the OC might not be for you. As it is a new plate I took a little extra time so I could get a feel for it. So, will have to report back on what happens in cruise control mode.\n\nI think a lot of people like the C and above plates, but I don't find I need that level to achieve excellent results daily.\n\n**//The rest of the setup**\n\nI chose to use products I'm amply familiar with so I could judge the razor on its own merits. I love this soap, it performs very very well. You would probably not guess it's a vegan base because of the bias against them in general. It can take a lot of water, and it behaves like a lower structure/dense lather, but has some volume too. Great stuff.\n\nTuxedo knot works great. Been using a lot of badger knots lately and have finally come to believe that the high end badgers are more luxurious feeling. However, your cheap synthetic brush will produce a great lather too - no arguments with the end results.\n\nBoucheron Jaipur has become a go-to frag for me. It's elegant and refined, and it lasts. Creamy with a mild citrus note it pairs well with scents like Padre Leone - a more old school refined gentleman's parfum. Non-offensive, and a very luxurious scent while not breaking the bank at all.",

The post-shave feel is a bit dry on the skin but I don't use it for the post shave. As long as the shave was great, I could supplement that with other balms.\n\n**The Razor and Blade** combination worked well. I could feel that the Razorock old type is a lot milder than the Gillette. I could buff some areas without feeling irritated. However, the Razorock needed the buffing since it cannot take down certain areas without going over it couple times. Still a good razor but it tends to be on the mild side.\n\n**The Brush** was something that I took out last night. I wasn't planning to use this brush because it is short, stubby, and rough on the face. However, I do need a travel brush and I need one that can be disposable if I lose it/damage it. This was the choice. It performed well but as I feared, it was still scritchy and pokey. I did more of a painting motion and it dulled the scritch. A good brush but just not my thing. I'll keep it for a travel use.\n\n**The aftershave portion** was great. This is turning out to be one of my favorite post-shave method. The WH calms down the skin and the Ice Cold Balm brings to chill to the morning. Paired with menthol soap and cold water, BRHHHHHHH!!! I feel cold just thinking about it.\n\nOverall, a great shave. I was pleased with all of the products and felt great afterwards. I couldn't get a BBS today but a good shave. I feel stubbles here and there but I didn't want to overbuff my skin. I'll continue to break in the midget boar brush and get it ready for travel use.",

Some of it was wasted on mediocre soaps/brushes (regrets, I have a few), and some of it was for razors that I evolved out of as my technique improved and I considered them too mild. I've slowed my roll in 2019 but the upside is that I've settled on one razor and a couple brushes that work well for me, and I've got years' worth of software/blades. Considering all the samples in my collection (like the Cheshire I used today), I can probably shave for at least 2 months daily, without repeating products. So really, the finance dork in me would note that my year 1 expenses should be capitalized over several years...which makes me feel somewhat better about dropping all that cash ;-)",

I had about three day's growth, which is pretty long for me, and it was just phenomenal. Had a pretty stringy lather build, which was new for me from the ATR, but it worked out very well. Didn't use an aftershave today, wasn't really feeling Executive Man or Texaus with ATR, so decided to forego it.\n\nI'm ready for the rain to stop here in SoCal. It feels like we have had all the rain for the calendar year in the space of 3 months. I'd much rather spread it out, or just not have it during baseball season.\n\nHappy Shaves Y'all!",

I received yesterday the sight unseen razor I ordered a few weeks ago to /u/RocTraitor74 via Etsy, so I had to try it in today's shave.\n\nI have to say that I was a little nervous at first : I didn't shave in 4 days in a row, so I had to take a little dense early beard with an unexperienced hand with a straight razor. However, as I decided to go only on the cheeks, jaw and the high right-under-the-jaw neck areas on WTG and a part of XTG passes, I didn't get any irritations nor cuts. Not even a wheeper ! Yet, I couldn't say that the straight razor part was comfortable, but this is obviously because I have not found the right angle for now. I still decided to use my DE favourite razor to shave the troublespots, because I didn't feel I would have been able to shave it without drama.\n\nAnd oh dear, how my skin got smooth after only one pass with this monster ! I see great times coming into a mid-term future with straight razors. Cause despite of the little uncomfortable first steps, by the end of the shave I managed to get a pretty decent angle and wrist use, which made this straight razor discovery far more efficient than my DE razor's one.\n\nAlso, I got this brush at the january brush drop from /r/Phteven_j and all I can say about that is this brush is even more good-looking than in the pictures he got from 'em ! And after a few shave the knot became the most efficient and comfortable that I ever had (well, okay I only had 3 brushes before it lol).",

Living in California I rarely see snow unless I'm skiing in Tahoe. I would say I miss snow, but after living in Kodiak Alaska for two years, I really don't. I feel the same way about snow that [Anakin felt about sand.](https://i.imgur.com/TlepWRZ.jpg) I don't like it. That said, the occasional winter scent can be nice especially for the holidays.\n\nFor today's theme I picked Nocturne. During the fall and winter of 2018, Nocturne was one of the soaps I used most frequently. I wore it when I took my family to Tahoe for a fall vacation, when we went apple picking at an orchard during the harvest and during Christmas morning. Nocturne *feels* like a winter in California. Cold, dry leaves, apple picking at harvest for Christmas pies and after the last set of wildfires, smokey. Since January I haven't found myself reaching for this puck much and I was glad to see the theme come up. It reminded me of some very pleasant winter holidays with my family.\n\nIn other news, turns out Robots can get sick. I'm fine, but as I type this, Robot Jr. is asleep atop me while I'm rocking him. His sister was sick a few days ago and now he has it. Thankfully it's nothing major and if he follows the same course as his sister, he will be better in 48 hours.\n\nFinally, I posted up a thread in the /r/Shave_Bazaar looking to trade or buy some Noble Otter NeV or DG Lamplight Penance as well as some other stuff. There may be a picture of a cat riding a unicorn hidden in their too. Take a look!\n\nWe're almost to the weekend boys, stay strong and have a wonderful Thursday.\n\nRobot",

Wonderful scent from the lather, aftershave lasts for hours. Used the straight for WTG/XTG, then finished ATG with the Karve. Very close and comfortable shave but did cut myself on the cheek when I set the blade on it. Still trying to figure out how to go ATG on my neck, the blade just skips for me, may try stropping before the third pass. I haven't been able to find any videos of anyone going from their mouth to ear which is against the grain for me, and I haven't figured out a way to do it comfortably yet.",

It felt very small on my face as I lathered. It is softer than my Omega for certain and holds less lather as well. I under loaded and had to go back to the puck twice. Overall I liked the feel of it and appreciated not feeling like my entire face was going to be swallowed up in the brush while I lathered.\n\nHappy Thursday.

Lots of water added this time and the lather was fantastic. Razor felt *very* smooth against it even for three-day growth! No noticeable blade issues to report.\n\n\nFirst time using an aftershave splash and man did it feel good. Nice cooling alcohol feel a few seconds after application.\n\n\nSweet lemon scent for both the soap and AS is really nice. It's a soft citrus (Japanese Yuzu) and has a lovely calming effect. I really like it.\n\n\nDisappointment of the night: the 24mm Yaqi. I think the knot is too deep in the handle that doesn't allow the bristles to spread nicely. It's like I'm fighting the brush while lathering (in a bowl). I have another yaqi 24mm tuxedo that doesn't feel this way.. it's too bad since I really like the handle on this one.\n\nOn a different note, this cold is starting to get to me. Another -20 day. Spent some serious time in the gym last night to drive away the winter blues.. at least the sun is shining!\n\nHave a great Thursday!\n",

      "body": "Thursday 3/7 SOTD\n\n* Razor: Timeless 0.68 SB SS w 100 mm plaid handle\n* Blade: Polisilver (3)\n* Brush: Yaqi Chianti 24mm synth\n* Soap: Wholly Kaw Cuero Oscuro tallow, DM, hops.\n* Post: Aqua Velva 5 in 1 Sensitive Balm\n* Frag: CL Lamplight Penance EDP\n\nProduct Notes:\n\n* **Razor / Blade:** Another uneventful two pass BBS from this efficient combo. The plaid 4 inch handle remains the only deficiency in the combo, being hard to maneuver due to length and weight, and from its tendency to feel slippery when even slightly wet. I am coming off the ATT Windsor 3.5\" handle and the CG 4.0\" and both of those are certainly not lightweights but are both much easier to shave with and produce no hand fatigue at all. The Timeless plaid, though gorgeous, is a chore to use.\n* **Soap**: An excellent winter scent, would probably feel very out of place in warmer times. Performance is excellent, and the scent is a very unusual dirty, harsh leather that is very polarizing. Makes Roam seem like a crowd-pleaser by comparison!\n* **Brush**: New acquisition, due to CC points surplus on Amazon. Bought from the WCS store there, with a $3 buying on Amazon surcharge. Unpleasant, but still came to $0 after the points were used. so hard to complain. It's getting harder and harder to find any decent wet shaving stuff on Amazon, amidst all the hucksters selling rebranded Weishis, \"SWEDISH steel\" and \"real badger\" brushes that will strip your face off even as the brush itself rapidly disintegrates.\n* The brush is excellent, beautiful handle meant to suggest the complex coloration of red wine. The fiber is similar (exactly the same?) as the \"silk smoke\" stuff sold by other vendors, and the mid loft moderate to high fiber density and tall handle make this an easy splaying brush that is also soft and possesses moderate backbone.\n* There's a theory that every synth fiber now available from Yaqi (who both sells its own stuff and also supplies the great majority of the synth market) is all the same, but is just colored differently. The cynics hold that different vendors just combine the colors in different styles of diameter, glue bump, fiber density, and loft and then claim magical, utterly unique results from their specific combo.\n* I can't say the Chianti disproves this - it is quite different from its stablemate the Yaqi Mew Brown Moca, but that's mainly due to the differing lofts and handle to knot proportions. And really, the two brushes I own from Yaqi are not radically different from other branded Tuxedos, Gamechangers, BOSS, etc. that I own.\n* It'd be nice to see some scientifically minded lad or lassie do an actual material analysis of all the different fiber types and see if there is anything different between them. As Yaqi themselves do not market their own brushes as having any distinctive performance characteristics based on fiber type, I have my doubts on this, but will of course yield to Science if evidence shows a real difference.\n* **Frag**: Another marvelous cold weather scent! It as if melancholy loneliness had a scent - may work equally well in summer for some, but I think of this as a depth of winter sort of scent.",

Sounds like a good way to never finish any of my soaps off, which I sorely need to do. I just pick what sounds enjoyable on the day and let the lather fly.\n\nWent with TNEV because I don't get around to using the Noblest of Otters nearly enough. I was torn between this and Barrbarr when I was first making a purchase, but I don't think there is anything else with this unique scent profile on the market. As another user on here remarked recently, NO soaps have to be one of the best performance to cost ratios we have, and their scents are pretty killer to boot.\n\nHave a good one!",

And I've been using sharper blades in the .68 OC and it's been quite aggressive feeling. But this blade calmed the OC down nicely.\n\nDid not use post-shave today, and there was no problem.\n\n#### ❧ Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Timeless .68 - Open Comb ::: Wilkinson Sword - India ‹7 uses›)*\n\nI was confident while working this razor and it didn't stir up any razor burn or irritation. This is a good blade, for me at least, for this razor. Cut close with it too.\nNo tugging or irritation.\n\n#### ❧ Soap Notes\n*^(Tim's Soap - Roots)*\n\nMy first time with Tim's. It's a very good soap. I needed to load for a bit longer, and I'm afraid the scent was too light.\n\n40 second load with lightly-wet dense boar brush + 2 tsp water = 3 passes of a-little-too-wet lather. Next time I should load for 10-20 sec longer.\n\nScent: I liked this green vetiver type of scent. Not much complexity too it, but who says there always has to be?\n\nScent Strength: 3-4/10, very lightly present during shaving. Probably too low for me.\n\nBowl - I used the XL version of this bowl:\nhttps://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3392930\n\n\n#### ❧ Shave Quality\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Cut flush to where I just see the tips (above average for me)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm)\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

It was my second shave with the X3 head and this 7 O'Clock blade. Much different from the first go round. A bunch of weepers on the neck and a lot of post shave irritation.\n\nThe good news is that although it wasn't the best shave ever, I learned some good lessons last night.\n\n* The pre shave face wash didn't seem to make as much difference on prepping my neck as I'd thought it might have. So that might not be as necessary on most nights.\n\n* Although it wasn't the closest shave ever I managed to hold myself back from totally destroying my neck in a vain attempt to clean it up.\n\nMy lather wasn't great last night. Although I wasn't specifically participating in the theme today, this sample of Stirling Barbershop I have is just about dead. Might be able to get one more shave out of it, but will need to push it all in the middle.\n\nWhiskey Wednesday SOTN. Went with some Wild Turkey Rare Breed last night. Haven't had this one in a while. Strong notes of vanilla, corn, and a heavy barrel flavor. Bourbon hasn't been my whiskey of choice lately but I've had this bottle hanging around for awhile so I figured I'd put it in the rotation. Did some small samples of Basil Haden and Sagamore Rye after to compare. I definitely prefer the higher rye content in the BH and rye over the Wild Turkey. However, I couldn't taste much other than the spice of the rye and the fact that they were smoother to me after the WT.",

WTG, XTG/ATG, and clean up. Not bad but I felt couple stubbles here and there after the shave. I was using a bit more pressure with the mild razor but I'm glad I didn't overdo it. Great soap and aftershave portion.\n\n**The Soap** was great. It has a bright, fruity scent at first and fizzles into a bit more sprite-like scent towards the end. I would say it's a unisex scent that anyone can enjoy. The performance was great unlike last night's hand lather with a midget boar brush. I think my brush didn't take in much soap but today, it worked fantasically. Good slickness and protection. Good post-shave feel and not as drying as other soaps.\n\n**The Razor and Blade** combination was good. Maybe the blade is getting duller but the sharpness just isn't there. I would have to go through several passes on certain areas and I still couldn't get it smooth. It cut well through the stubbles and was very smooth. However, I couldn't get the BBS shave at the end. I do want to keep using the blade but it's just not doing the best. It doesn't tug but it doesn't perform as well.\n\n**The Brush** was enjoyable to use. It's such a huge difference compared to the pure badger brush. I'm not sure how it can be so different but for whatever reason, it is so much softer. Plush on the face and gave a good enough scrub without irritating the skin. Still remains as one of my favorite brushes to use.\n\n**The aftershave portion** was great. I haven't use the Alum Block in a while and hooo my gosh. Boy it stung. I do have a slight zit on the corner of my mustache and I think shaving opened it a bit. The sting lasted for couple seconds but it wasn't too bad. Ended with the freezing Ice Cold Balm. Good stuff.\n\nOverall, that was a good shave. Not a BBS but a smooth and enjoyable shave. I'll probably change up all the products for the next shave and try some other goodies. I'm thinking of using Gillette Knack with Astra SS and a Razorock Soap.",

I'm pretty sure my Dogwood brush is getting here today, which I am SUPER stoked about.\n\nWell, this was a job interview shave for me today. I'm up for a promotion at work and met with my past manager who runs the team I am looking to move to. I already knew him and the role, so I am pretty confident I'll get it, but it's still a bit nerve-wracking. I'll find out what is actually happening tomorrow.",

Today is going to be a big mail call. I picked up a bunch of awesome soaps from /u/BourbonInExile and they should be arriving later today. It's always nice to have some new stuff to play with and I already have some photos planned.\n\nAlso, I can finally say goodbye to this scam of a badger brush. Art of Shaving really took me for a ride when I started out and now I cringe at how much I paid for my 22mm pure badger brush. Anyhow, last night I got a package from /u/Ugmug. Like a silent PIF guardian angel, he read that I was looking for a new badger to replace my Art of Scamming brush and he sent me a [Stirling Finest Badger.](https://i.imgur.com/SnFsFkP.jpg) I gotta say, next to my AoS, the Stirling has some real [big dick energy (SFW).](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=big+dick+energy&=true)\n\nAnyhow, today's shave is Executive Man. I like a little pick me up as I go into the end of the week. Executive Man if nothing else screams confidence... a big dick energy, if you will. It's a can't lose smell. My only concern with wearing it is that perhaps it smells a little too good for the workplace and that's why I tend to use Executives, older and slightly restrained brother Sharp Dressed Man more often. I don't know about you, but I cant afford an HR claim for wearing some big dick energy soap too often. I have a family to provide for. Either way they are excellent scents and I think dollar for dollar, Stirling is the best value brand on the wet shave market.\n\nOn other news, my son is still sick but the fever is gone. He is sleeping poorly at the moment and I've been up all night putting him back to sleep. By tomorrow he should be back to his normal, into everything, rambunctious little boy self.\n\nHave a Good Friday Y'all,\nRobot",

It's not my favorite scent, but it's different and the base is terrific. This cream has some of the best performance out there, especially for the price. Oriental is my favorite of the bunch, but have not tried Chypre or Pear Brr Shop yet. The two-band finest knot in the Grizzly Bay is breaking in well, soft tips with some scrub and backbone. No scritch. Quickly becoming a favorite of mine.",

I'm slowly getting used to this soap's scent. I didn't like it at first but enjoy it a bit more with every use. I'm getting better with the base too : never had a bad shave with it but it's getting better as I understand how thirsty it is ! It helps that the scent pairs rather well with my personnal favourite LQV. I hope it's getting reissued at some point.\nHave a good day !",

I need to practice that. There was a woman that owned a house near my house(apparently I owned a house there) who ran a cat rescue for ill-socialized cats. She worked on giving them therapy. There were stringent rules on cat populations on properties, and she was apparently disqualified despite having a license, with all of her cats removed shortly after. I recall trying to comfort her and the process of comforting being awkward, because I didn't know her all that well. Her home was large, and the cats mostly lived in a barn like structure with communal feeding bowls.",

I know that they take a while to get to me (about 2 weeks), but I keep hearing amazing things about them and am I am really glad I pulled the trigger and ordered them.\n\nHappy Friday!",

Wind chill values as low as -7. West wind 5 to 15 mph. High tide at 12:20 this afternoon.\n\nBrush Lathers: 36\nThe conversation yesterday with /u/K1986 about the backbone of this brush had me paying more attention to that aspect. And on second thought the backbone on this is actually not as high as I thought it was. Out of all my brushes it's probably one of the lowest amount of backbone that I have. I guess that goes to show that I prefer something with a little less backbone, as is evident by that when I do use a brush with a good amount of backbone I immediately notice, and am a bit put off by it. So in this regard I really like this brush.\n\nRazor/Blade: I've been wanted to try a GEM-style SE for a while now, and saw this Featherweight on ShaveHQ during the last drop. It was described as mild, which is what I like so I pulled the trigger. Got it in last night. It looks almost new, apart from a little blemish on the top cap it looks like I could have just pulled it out of the package. How's it shave? It's shaves wonderfully. Took a bit to get the angle down as it's not as intuitive as either the Timeless or Wolfman (to compare it to DEs), or my Schick Grip or Hydro-Magic. That said, I am glad there is some audible feedback when it's cutting, otherwise I don't think I would have known it was doing anything, it was that mild. I would like to shout out to /u/fuckchalzone fora great product and service. I think this razor will definitely make it into the regular rotation.\n\nHope everyone has a nice Friday!",

Felt nice enough on the face. I left the brush too wet when I loaded it though so the first two minutes of trying to lather in my bowl were basically spent stirring soap soup. I guess I need to spend some time experimenting with this brush to get the balance of soap and water right.\n\nThe Astra felt miles better in the Tech today than it did in my Edwin Jagger on Wednesday. BBS everywhere including problem patches on my neck and jaw. No irritation anywhere that couldn't be blamed on my super-dry skin from a week of blowing my nose every few minutes. I'm afraid the future is looking grim for Edwin.",

The second pass wasn't as smooth but wasn't really tugging just yet. I can't believe I reached 50 shaves on a single blade. Prior to that I think the longest I pushed a blade was 6 or 7 shaves.

I watched the video with [Will from B&M](https://youtu.be/RqfUvqLxOy8) explaining how to lather the Reserve so I knew it wouldn't be super thick. I had a pretty soupy lather. The scent isn't just a pure lavender as I was expecting but is based on a fragrance from Wales. The only scent listed is Lavender but Mrs CosmoBarber said she didn't recognize it as lavender. It's a warm and very pleasant scent. I'll need another go to get the lather where I feel it needs to be. Still very happy with it.\n\nI'm still progressing with the Shavette. This WCS is much lighter then my Equinox and easier to handle but not sure if that's a plus for shavability. Again, needs more reps.\n\nI'm happy it's Friday because I'm absolutely wiped out. Work all day and school all night is a big challenge and I'm enjoying the personal growth. I've created my first IG account dedicated to wetshaving and hair cutting. So now I have that to obsess over as well.\n\nHave a great Friday\n\nEdit - Forgot to add the brush",

I remember it came in a nice burlap pouch with a cool little postcard and everything. I'm sure the V2 stuff is noticeably better, but I've always had great shaves with my set. Last night, something weird. I felt some burning. I don't know why, and it's never happened with this before, so it coulda just been a one off, since it was a post gym shave...but who knows. Also, I noticed my tin seemed to have seperated more than any of my other stuff. It looks kinda weird after it sits for a while...maybe I'll take a pic sometime, but it doesn't matter. Still works great, and I love da Otter.\n\nAlso, yes, I used a VdH blade. Works fine for me WTG and XTG, but I don't think it's a great idea to try to go BBS ATG with these. At least for me.\n\nI'm going to steal the idea of posting a song here...\n\nSONG! Been on a Hum kick lately...missed out on the vinyl reissue of Downward is Heavenward, but here's one of my favs of all time : [Hum - Stars](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMEB4HNNZ2I)",

I did not end up with irritation. But since I may not have used the brushless cream properly, I won't make any judgements about the Fig Bellow at this point.\n\nThough I can tell you that I like the heft and size of it.\n\nThis one is maybe the roughest looking razor I own. He's been through a lot. Looks like someone took a wire brush to his cap!\n\n#### ❧ Soap Notes\n*^(Mon Platin - Dead Sea Minerals Shaving Cream)*\n\nMy first time with a brushless cream. I tried to follow instructions as best I could. They didn't say to add water, but I felt like I got better results when I did.\n\n**If anyone knows how best to use this, I'd love to hear from you.**\n\nAlcohol and Menthol are both in this cream! I did feel something lightly come up my face and bother my eyes a little. I did get a bracing cool blast if I used cool water to rinse, but with warm, it wasn't there.\n\nScent: seems powdery to me, with something else in there. Didn't mind it at first, but when it wouldn't leave, I started to hate it.\n\nScent Strength: 7/10, definitely present during shaving. And, like a visiting in-law, it seemed okay at first. But it wasn't too long before I wanted this smell off my face and hands. Next morning, after the night shave, and it was still there. Ooof. Serenity NOW!\n\nBowl - I used the XL version of this bowl:\nhttps://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3392930\n\n\n#### ❧ Shave Quality\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: A little irritating\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Very Close Shave\n*Neck*: Cut flush to where I just see the tips (above average for me)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm)\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

Boar brush was not as comfortable when face lathering so I switched to a bowl. 2 pass WTG tonight for a little clean up without irritating the skin too much as this is a back to back shave.\n\nDG Sweet Lemon AS smelled like coconut to me this time around.

I learned if I apply too much Sandalwood AS I will have a reaction, so I guess I can't be too liberal with the application. It's okay though, considering this is the only sandalwood scent I actually enjoy.\n\nHappy Friday everyone!",

The first complete set I was able to grab was this one. TST has this at a 2.55 for me which seems about right. Interesting scent but I won't be getting a full set of this one. There's enough soap to last me quite a few shaves though so we'll see how this changes.",

I'm pretty confident I've got it and that this is just a formality, but still a bit of a nervous feeling.\n\nWe got nailed by a random blizzard (at least, it feels like a blizzard) this morning, which made my commute horrible. I was not fooled by our false Spring the last week.\n\nThis was my first time using the OC D plate for my Karve. It felt significantly more aggressive than the C Plate I've used over the last couple days. I managed to nick my jawline twice, but it wasn't bad. It's a close shave, and I think it will be more comfortable once I've used the plate a couple of more times. I'm pretty damn impressed with the OC Karve plates. They are smooth!\n\nIt was also my first time using the Bon Vivant soap and splash (I've used the EdT previously). Great scent. I didn't love the soap off the puck, but it is much better lathered, and then the splash and EdT take it to a new level. That seems to be a theme with some of Chatty Lux's line, but maybe it's just because his scents are so complex that they challenge you a bit. Regardless, I'm a huge fan of CL and just ordered Biblio this morning. I also figured I might as well pick up a 30 mL of Lamplight while I was at it.",

This won't be my shave of the day. This tin of Mikes is going to the Post Office today, headed to /u/SoullessSingularity in exchange for some Dr. Jon \"13\". Ethically, it didn't feel right to shave with a traded soap, even if I was still in possession of it. I did however want to get a photo of it before I shipped it off, along side my new Stirling brush that was a gift from /u/Ugmug.\n\nEthics are a funny thing. You never know when they will pop up, at least it seems that way for me. Sure I have rules that I follow, things that I know to be right and wrong, but then there's grey areas. Case in point. I just got some \"Night Music\" from/u/BourbonInExile and as part of an upcoming photo I was coming up with ideas. I thought I might do a hard focus on the tub as it's sitting atop black silk with ladies underwear scattered across it and around it. Implying as /u/BALD_and_BEARDLESS once said *\"a high class orgy... In the best possible way.\"*\n\nHere's the issue, where do I get the underwear from? It goes without saying that my wife's will **NOT** be used. I like y'all, but not that much. So my only option would be to buy them. Then what? I use the garments for some photos and then return them? I don't think that's right. What if I buy them and then give them to Goodwill? What if I buy them from Goodwill to defray costs. Does Goodwill even sell underwear?\n\n**Ew, yuck, yuck, yuck**\n\nThese are all thoughts that went through my head. Obviously I had to scrap that idea and went back to the drawing board.\n\nAnyhow, my actual SOTD today will be Night Music. I was a little concerned about notes like the blending of five musks and one reviewer comparing it to a barn with \"animalistic\" notes. I don't get that at all. Some musk, sure, but the vanilla and bergamot are far more present. I think it's fantastic. It's a little dirty, sexy and clean all at the same time. It was a blind purchase, but it was a home run and will be staying on my keeper shelf.\n\nIn other news, my son is over his cold and I'm taking my family to the local farmers market today. I don't know about y'all, but I love farmers markets. The food is fresher and cheaper than a grocery store. You cut out the middle man and are able to buy right from the producers. We usually stock up on our fruits and veggies for the week every Saturday. My daughter likes to pick out the fruit and it's a good way to spend some family time together while she learns where our food comes from.\n\nI hope y'all have a good Saturday!\n\nRobot",

Sad to see this one go, but all good things must come to an end right?\n\nHallows is also appropriate because I finished watching The Haunting of Hill House last night. I'm normally not a horror fan, but this was an excellent show. It's more of a family drama with a little horror mixed in. So, if you're on the fence about watching it, give it a try. It's fantastic. Just scary enough to make you watch an episode of The Andy Griffith Show afterwards so you can calm down :).\n\nJust have to make it through today and tomorrow at work...then a week off to catch up on life.

      "body": "**2019-03-09 SOTD**\n\n**Prep:** Took a warm shower, shaved with cool water\n\n**Brush:** Maggard Plisson-style 24mm Synthetic\n\n**Lather:** Barrister & Mann Reserve Classic\n\n**Razor:** 1961 Flare Tip Super Speed\n\n**Blade:** Astra Superior Platinum (shave #13)\n\n**Post:** Stirling Unscented Post-Shave Balm\n\n**Soundtrack:** Songs for the Deaf, by Queens of the Stone Age\n\n**Thoughts:**\n\nFirst go on a B&M Reserve soap. It lathered up nicely with 1/4 tsp of soap (thank you for the tip, /u/sgrdddy) and a fairly wet brush and made a beautiful, almost overflowing bowl of foam... \"Looks good!\" I thought, but I must have done something wrong because the shaving performance wasn't nearly as good as... well to be honest, it wasn't as good as any other soap I've ever shaved with. This was one of my all-time worst lathers ever in terms of shave performance. It honestly felt like the first time I tried using Proraso and didn't know anything about how to lather soap. It was constantly drying out on my face, leaving my razor sticking to the skin instead of gliding along. Absolutely awful slickness and zero residual slickness at all. Attrocious post-shave feel with ugly razor rash all over my neck. Loads of irritation. Sort of embarassed to go out in public like this.\n\n**I've seen enough reviews of Reserve that say \"use more water than you think you need\" to know that this was my own damn fault and the quality of the soap isn't the problem.** I'll give the Reserve base another shot for my next shave, but... definitely not with this scent.\n\nOne of my grandmothers was an upper class nurse who lived in a small mansion, wore a lot of perfume, and drank a lot of vodka / consumed a lot of stolen narcotics from the hospital. She didn't like me and I didn't like her. This soap (along with Reserve Fern and Cologne Russe) reminds me a lot of the way the master bathroom always smelled at her house, with all her vintage perfumes and scented bath products. It makes it very difficult for me to give an objective assessment of its fragrance.\n\nTryThatSoap lists this soap's scent notes as Citrus, Oakmoss, Lavender, and Sandalwood. Prior to smelling Barrister & Mann's soaps, I thought I knew what all those things smelled like and I had very high hopes for this soap. I had expected the citrus would be more zesty and forward (as it often is in the Stirling soaps that I've tried), the sandalwood would smell more like my actual real-life sandalwood comb, and the lavender would smell more green than purple. Instead, I'm finding this very floral, not very citrusy, and more creamy than woody. I'm getting a little more of the oakmossy powder thing in the drydown as the other fragrances burn off, but it's pretty mild. I strongly dislike this fragrance, *...but that doesn't mean it's a objectively bad.* It just means that *I* don't like it. My kitty loves it, at least. He won't stay out of my face after this shave, which has made it very difficult to type this post.\n\nBetween the poor performance and the negative emotional response to the fragrance, I honestly couldn't wait for this shave to end. It was just so awful in every way. I'll give a different Reserve scent a go next time and try to \"dial in\" that lather better.\n\n**Edit:** I have one nice thing to say about this soap now. Several hours have passed and I went back and smelled my shaving brush. The oakmoss-sandalwood drydown on it smells very nice now that the citrus and lavender have departed, but I think it smells better on the brush than on my skin.",

It feels like the knot is set way too high so that it has just enough backbone that it won't splay, but not enough to keep it from flopping like a paintbrush when you face lather. I'll give it a few more shaves, but this one is a bit of a disappointment so far.",

Gonna hafta agree and say that, when given the proper amount of work and attention, it's slicker than greased owl shit and don't argue with my analogy because it sounds good even if owls don't actually shit and blah blah blah. Honestly wasn't expecting that caliber of performance from a puck of soap that had a 40 cent price tag on it, but stranger things have happened. Seriously, just an all around great shave right there!\n\nStill enjoying the Blizzard Balm from Sudsy Soapery on a regular basis, even if I don't actually mention it on my SOTD posts. Just the right amount of menthol with a light enough scent that can be covered up by almost anything.\n\nAnd this is my first time wearing 1 Million. I haven't read scent notes so I'm not gonna comment quite yet before I wear it a few more times but I do enjoy it.",

The one scent I have that it reminds me of is Stirling Island man only instead of the fruit mixed in with the bay-laurel/spice accords, it is some kind of tropical floral scent. Either way, I like it. I just plan to cut it with a little thayers next time because it smells great, but yow does it burn.",

Seemed to improve the performance. I can't fathom why that changes anything. I put the Barberpole handle back on as well. I'm still struggling to get what I would consider BBS. 2 1/2 passes and very comfortable but I doubt this is BBS. Even as it seems my SAD is beginning to get under control I can feel a RAD itch developing. I'm curious to try the .84 plate on this razor to see if it's more efficient or just too harsh for me. I'll see what I can get done in the next couple months. The soap was just black tea as I lathered and the toner has been much more complex. I always enjoy this base. It's like home at this point. I think the boar is finally beginning to break-in and I got three passes worth of lather out of it. It feels at least as soft as my synthetic at this point when bowl lathering and I wonder how it would do at face lathering in the near future.",

The beef tallow/ duck fat base performed well but I'm not big on the Freesia and Apricot scent. I can pick out the light apricot scent but I don't think the Freesia agrees with my nose.",

So far it's gotten a lot softer but stills eats lather. I'm\nsure that will fix it's self with time. So far I think it's a great brush for the money.

I wont be buying the soap in a full tub, but i am amazed of how long it lasts.

Thank god Mrs. Robot vetted this stuff first, otherwise she might have accuse me of coming home from a stripclub. Actually, to compare Night Music to a strip club is a disservice to the soap. Night Music is more like the Playboy Mansion and shaving with it, I feel like [Hugh Hefner in his prime](https://i.redd.it/7kll1kx90r7y.png). Throughout the day I would continuously catch the occasional whiff of Iris and Vanilla tinged with a bit of musk. There's a bit of powder and rich leather I ascribe to the musk present as well. It's an absolutely fantastic blend of notes and my only regret is that I don't have any AS or EdT to pair with it.\n\nSpeaking of AS, I was at a bit of loss for what to reach for. I just got some Noble Otter NeV courtesy of /u/Ythin as a gift and that was one option. Trythatsoap lists the notes as similar, though I get far more sweetness from NeV than I do Night Music. Darkfall was another option I had and what I ended up settling on. Obviously the scents are totally different, but I thought the spicy notes would play off of the soap pretty well and I ended up enjoying it.\n\nIn other news; we got a fair amount of rain out here in the Bay Area today and I had to cancel my trip to the farmers market. I ended up taking my family to a local park during a break in the rain. Kids cooped up in the house is the worst. There's no place for them to get their energy out and they get stir crazy. Do any of y'all remember when parents would give us keys to the house for after school or we could go outside and play until dark? My kids will never know the feeling of being told to go play in the nearby field and be back before dinner. Everyone has a phone and is only a call away. Hell, let a child go play outside unattended and you might get a call from CPS. It's sad that kids have lost that chance for exploration without their parents being labeled as irresponsible.\n\nFinally, the photo... Night Music is a risqué scent, implying torrid rendezvous and sensual moments. The photo was inspired by that and I hope it elevates the story of Night Music without coming across as coarse or vulgar.\n\nHave a lovely Sunday\n\nRobot",

The scent is terrific and is dominated by the Rose. Soap is very soft and loaded easy into the badger not. The soap didn't take much water on this first go around and made a very slick lather. I may continue to use this base and offer a first impressions since I have seen very little information on the company.",

This was the first Barrister and Mann soap I ever bought. The scent is still decently strong after all this time. The soap has dried out a little, but it still works fine. Besides, I've never been afraid of putting water into wetshaving. Duh. I sampled some of this soap out to someone, I can't remember who, and as a result there is a hole in the middle of the soap. It gives the false impression of impending death for the tub. There is still an enormous amount of soap left.\n\nI am torn between doing some sample slaying and using soaps I don't use much. Maybe I can alternate the two. Or maybe I'll use my favorite stuff. Or maybe I don't know what the fuck I'm going to do.\n\nSunday chores are calling me.",

If you can pick one up, for the price, I highly recommend. The SHD is going to be a huge seller. It is soft with zero scritch, and the tips gelled on first use. A bit less backbone than i'd like, but it's OK. I really should have used something in between this and the Declaration B7 i've been using for 2 weeks, that kinda wasn't fair to the SHD....Maybe before the next time I use it, i'll use a Yaqi or something. If you can't get your hands on a Declaration knot, or don't want to drop the cash, the SHD is a fine substitute and a definite upgrade from the Yaqi knots out there.",

It doesn't provide any tangible benefits. It messes with our sleep schedules. And hell, we're already on DST 8 months out of the year. That said... Seattle would be deeply hellish December through February if the sun was setting an hour earlier.\n\nNice head shave this morning with Trumper's Spanish Leather. I over-loaded somewhat (always a potential problem with creams) and the lather on the first pass was a bit on the overly heavy side. But everything was lovely on the second pass. This is definitely one of those products I use for the smell rather than the superb properties of the lather. Sorry, Mr Trumper, but you've got nothing on our top-tier artisan soap bases.\n\nHave to leave the house in a couple hours to catch the ferry over to the Seattle side so I can catch an Uber to the airport so I can catch my flight to Phoenix so I can spend Monday and Tuesday working and learning in the PHX6 fulfillment center. When I started at Amazon, it was \"a good idea\" for everyone to go to the training. Then it became \"mandatory for new hires\". Then, somewhere around November, it became \"mandatory for everyone, if you haven't gone yet you've got 9 months to go.\" I'm a desk jockey and entirely unfit for any form of strenuous manual labor.

Stirling soaps never fail to perform very well.\n\nAstra SP blade is still going strong and didn't have any issues. Face lathering with the Stirling synthetic is a breeze and luxurious feeling.\n\nStirling scent wise, I'm on a Piacenza kick - not as strong as Bergamot Lavender but quite pleasant. I'm thinking along the lines of Sharp dressed man or executive man for my next Stirling scent. There seems like so many to choose from.\n\nHave a good time-change Sunday everyone.",

WTG, XTG/ATG, and clean up. I was a little more dazed because of the lost hour of day light saving but still had a good shave. Everything was smooth and felt great after. Couple of stubble here and there but no sweating over it.\n\n**The Soap** worked well. I didn't have much of an expectation because it was such a cheap soap. However, it worked better than I thought. It worked similar to Catie's Bubble, performing like a vegan soap. Good slickness and performance but nothing crazy. It did the job and I was happy with it. The scent is citrus/grapefruit with a hint of spice towards the end. A light and enjoyable smell.\n\n**The Razor and Blade** combination worked well. It was very smooth and sharp enough to cut through the stubbles. I really enjoyed this combination and didn't get any irritation at all. I could use a bit more aggressive and sharper blade but it's no big deal. Overall, very nice.\n\n**The Brush** worked well as always. I think this is one of my favorite Yaqi synthetics. It has a stubby handle and a great grip. The knot splays out well despite being embedded a bit more in. I always enjoy this brush whenever I use it and it'll continue to be a great one.\n\n**The aftershave portion** was great. Little stinging sensation with the alum block but it tightened the skin well. Finished with the Stirling Balm and I was feeling great and smelling good. My skin's still feeling smooth in the afternoon.\n\nOverall, a great shave. I was satisfied with all of the products and I can't wait to shave again with other soaps/razors/etcs. I'm planning on trying out more Stirling soaps and go back to my boar brushes later on.",

I am really impressed with my first taste of a The Club soap. And this is my first shave with a normal soap with the Big Fella: tremendous.\n\n#### ❧ Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Gillette - NEW Improved Big Fellow - 1926 ::: Gillette - 7 o'clock - Ylw ‹3 uses›)*\n\nWhat a great combo. Excellent cutting, almost not feeling it. I really like this razor. He's roughed up and pretty left him a long time ago. But he gets the job done with skill.\n\nNo tugging or irritation.\n\n#### ❧ Soap Notes\n*^(The Club - Hemmingway 1898+1)*\n\nI really like this scent, and it is a bit stronger -- happy am I -- than Stirling's Kaboom and Noble Otter's offering of the same name.\n\n30 second load with lightly-wet young boar brush + 5 tsp water = 6 passes of a most amazing, slick, creamy, elastic lather.\n\nScent: Based on cologne 1899, similar to Spicebomb with some vanilla. What a great blend. The notes helping each other out really well. Great fall and winter scent, but I'd wear this sucker all year long.\n\nScent Strength: 5/10, enjoyably present during shaving. I loved the clean up after the shave because i kept wafting it around and getting to enjoy it more. It didn't last long on my face, though. But that doesn't bother me.\n\nBowl - I used the XL version of this bowl:\nhttps://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3392930\n\n\n#### ❧ Brush Notes\n*^(Semogue - 1800 Boar ‹9 uses›)*\n\nloving this guy. Soft, but able to whip up a lather no problem. Soaked for 30 mins before shave today.\n\n#### ❧ Shave Quality\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Cut flush to where I just see the tips (above average for me)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm)\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

No blade feel and the hair came right off. Today's scent was in honor of yesterday's outing in crappy post drizzle weather.\n\nMy 5 year old finally wanted to go hiking yesterday, so we pulled a few miles in a park close to my house that has a bald eagles nest. No luck spotting eagles, but he was stoked to hear a few chickadees and woodpeckers. We also had to make an emergency stop on the trail so he could go pee. So the first thing he tells his mom when we walk in the door: \"Guess what?!? I got to pee on a tree!!\" Gotta love kids... XD",

It worked quite well. I'm not sure it's quite as good as blooming but it's close. Sweet lemon is a wonderful scent, and I kind of regret not getting the splash. It's perfect for the warmer weather ahead. I broke out a very old sample of classic vanilla to pair with it. A nice scent and works well with the citrus of sweet lemon.",

I went with my setup that popped my wetshaving cherry (the setup which I've mastered) to really test out this new Karve OC. It was great. Karve recommends that you do a step down to keep the same efficiency when moving from SB to OC. I kept the same level (going from E-plate SB to E-plate OC) and got a superior shave to using the F-plate SB. Just my opinion.\n\n\nHere it is *with* the hyperbole:\n\n\nJesus, this was the best shave of my life! Such *slick, creamy lather!* Totally whipped it up in, like, 25 seconds! BBS with half a pass of WTG! And, oh God, the *residual slickness!*\n\n\n**Thoughts on the song:** Been getting nostalgic for Mall Metal. Saw a few posts (including one from u/MadDingersYo which really made me question whether or not I'm over my contempt of Limp Bizkit, which I am, but I still really dislike Fred Durst), so I got on board and cranked up my cellphone to 11 while I shaved with my new Karve baseplate.",

Gotta give this skin a chance to recover. Picked Dunshire because I'm quite familiar with the Stirling base now and this is an optimistic scent... it's supposed to go up to -3°c today! That's warm enough for snow to start melting in the sunshine!\n\nI was going to put a few more shaves on the Astra blade to see how it handled at 15, but then I realized, \"I know this blade is already past its peak - why would I keep using it just to see *how uncomfortable* it gets? That's stupid.\" So I popped in a fresh Shark Super Chrome. I haven't used one of these since I moved from cheap creams to artisan soaps, so in other words: this was my first shave with a Shark with a decent lather.\n\nMy face is still a bit rashy and tender from my last shave (plus really dry from non-stop nose blowing during my cold last week) so I probably shouldn't have shaved at all today. Ended up just irritating all the damage I did last time. It's going to be a few more shaves before I can get a proper reading on what I think of this blade, I suspect.",

This was my first chance to try this soap. Citricuyá was made for the 2017 South Florida Wet Shavers Meetup. Scent notes are Blood Orange, Passion fruit, Pink Pepper, Pear, and Galbanum and it is supposed to reflect a Floridian vibe.\n\nNow let me tell you, I've been to Florida over a dozen times. I once spent three terrible weeks in Mayport and at no point did I smell anything other than desperation and poor decisions. Then again, Mayport is a Navy Town so my opinions may be biased. I digress, regardless I've never once stepped off the plane in Orlando and thought \"Wow, is that pink peppercorn I smell!?\" Or flown into Miami, hopped in my lambo and became assaulted by the odor of passion fruit\". (Full disclosure, I don't actually have a Lambo, but even if I did I doubt passion fruit would rain upon me.).\n\nAnyhow. I was up last night taking photos. The daylight savings on Sunday threw off my sleep and between that and taking care of my son last night, I think my day is going to be less than stellar. Oh well, I can do all things through coffee. I'm going to keep this post short, take a nap for a bit and then take my daughter to school.\n\nStay classy /r/WetShaving and have a good Monday.\n\nRobot",

Literally the day after I ordered it, I was given a chance to take a sniff and fell in love. My problem then was that, thanks to SAD and SAD-related disorders, I've been unable to justify spending retail price (or even fragrancenet price), so the set has been sitting in my cabinet, lonely and mostly unused. Well, I got lucky a couple of weeks ago on the fragrance swap subreddit and snagged a mostly full bottle of Spicebomb and 1 Million for an affordable price. And now the magic is able to happen. I truly do love this scent and, even though it's mostly a cool weather scent, I know I'll break it out during the hotter months as well because fuck it.\n\nAs for the razor, I asked about affordable aggressive razors the other day and, thanks to u/Old_Hiker, I grabbed a Maggard V3A. After seeing it and how gnarly the blade gab is compared to everything else I own, I wanted to truly put it through its paces my first use, so I skipped shaving yesterday to see what would happen today. Holy shit y'all, that fucker sliced through my beard like nobody's business! And, the craziest part about it: no fucking tugging whatsoever!! I'be got some thick hair that grows hella fast and I've never skipped a day and then had an effortless shave like that. It was truly a thing of beauty! New favorite right here!",

Had it for months, was kinda reluctant to get around to it, due to bad memories of the Fine Bakelite Slant. No need for the worry - the Marvel gave a smooth, highly efficient and very rapid shave (12 mins for a two pass BBS). The ginormous blade gap looks a tad daunting, but the actual shave felt quite mild. The cutting angle was pretty intuitive to find also, and remained easy to hit throughout the shave. Handle was a bit short maybe, but other than that, no complaint.\n* Brush: The tall narrow Victorian shape works very well with the tall narrow synth knot here. Efficient to load and clean, nice combo of softness, backbone, and splayability. Arguably, every synth since the Gamechanger has been superfluous.\n* Soap: Excelsior continues to impress. As does the wonderful Beaudelaire scent!\n* Frag: Matches up very well with the soap scent.",

Woohoo. This weekend was my birthday, so I was really hoping to have a nice, celebratory shave, but felt disappointed with most of my soap scents. I'm realizing that if I continue to wet shave, this is going to remain a thing... Scents either don't exist that I want, they're discontinued / hard to find, or they sound okay but in smell, end up not being for me. Womp womp. Hopefully my likes will evolve? At least I have a few things I like!\n\nDecided to go with a new sample to try. Smells okay in the tub but when lathered, it was very light and I practically forgot what it was that I was supposed to be smelling. I'm still learning how to lather, but I think this was my best one yet.\n\nShaved sitting on my counter with my legs in the sink vs sitting in the shower. I think it was a bit faster and required less preparation as I didn't have to deal with a bowl of water, a towel, setting up everything so it's ready by me, etc. I'll be trying this method again!\n\nWas also a first for multiple passes. My legs don't seem sensitive, so previously I've been doing one pass ATG and it's been working well (no irritation, ingrown hairs, just a few missed spots). This time, since it was a bit more difficult to maneuver with my leg(s) in the sink, I did... Ehhh... A second pass combined of AGT and horizontal. Not going to lie, went over a few spots without lather and I felt nothing terrible. Do my legs even have feeling? Am I an alien?\n\nToday they feel... normal. Moisturized and smooth and no issues. We'll see how it feels later.\n\nNeeds improvement: lather, area around the knees, location to physically be in while shaving that isn't some sort of struggle lol.",

Had just enough energy after taking some pills for a shave. Went the comfort route with a familiar heart-warming scent and a tried and true cloud-soft badger.\n\nAnd... my skin was fine with no post-shave.\n\n#### ❧ Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Wolfman - WR1 Open Comb .61 Polished ::: Treet - Platinum ‹4 uses›)*\n\nOkay combo. Was working on a 2 day growth, and got a little tugging. This blade has worked wonders in another razor, IIRC. But not a great match with this one.\n\n#### ❧ Soap Notes\n*^(Cella)*\n\nToday's tub load w soft badger (and soft water): 40 sec load and 3.3 tsp soft water gave me 2-3 extra passes but was just a little too wet. I can't seem to remember that Cella likes to be a little drier than my usual high-elastic standard.\n\n{PRIVATE}\nTub-load notes (small comfy Boar): 40 sec load with a lightly wet brush + 4 tsp water = gave me an extra pass or so. But the lather was too wet. Just 3 tsp of water probably would have been about right. It looks like with Cella, I don't need to get the lather super elastic for it to work right on my face.\n\nTub-load notes (soft silvertip badger): 45 sec load with a lightly wet brush + 3 tsp water = gave me an extra pass or so. Lather was protective and enjoyable. Funny how much of a difference changing brushes makes.\n\nTub-load notes (with dense 2-band badger): 40 second load (with this brush, at least) is about right. This lather might have been spot on. Seemed a bit too dry, but I think that is just the way Cella is. Any wetter, and I start losing creaminess and glide. A lightly wet brush used during load and less than .5 tsp of water for the lather. Might just be a model lather for Cella.\n\nPast scooping notes: Try 1/8 tsp or so next time. 1/4 tsp gave me 3x as much lather as I needed. But that day it looked hot!\n{/PRIVATE}\nScent was great and about 4-5/10 for strength. Nice and present during shave.\n\n\n#### ❧ Brush Notes\n*^(Whipped Dog - Silvertip 22mm Tall Handle ‹7 uses›)*\n\nsuch comfort, folks. Cloud on the face.\n\n#### ❧ Shave Quality\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Cut flush to where I just see the tips (above average for me)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm)\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

I pulled out the WildWest brush tonight (Go Buckeyes) and it easily whipped up a beautiful lather. Everything was going great until the blade touched my face. Now, this blade isn't horrible but compared to the Feather Pro it isn't in the same league. The alum at the end of the shave told the story, I felt some burn here and there where with the Feather the alum was silent. The shave ended beautifully, the Armada Blossom is wonderful, I wish this was still in production. Overall a decent shave, we'll try another blade next shave. Have a great day folks!",

Today being Tuesday I'm reached for B&M's Tuesday. After an explosion of blood orange yesterday with Citricuyá, I was looking toward to something a little more peaceful and restrained.\n\nA few weeks back I got a sample of B&M Lavender Reserve as part of a larger trade. I'm sorry, but I've forgotten who it came from, so if you read this, please accept my apologies. My wife has been getting into the habit of smelling the soaps as they come in and after a single whiff of the lavender, claimed it as her own.\n\nSo, I had no idea going in what Tuesday would smell like aside from the dual notes of violet and lavender. I hoped it would be somewhat like a precursor to reserve lavender, but instead I found it was very violet foward with lavender playing second string. After a little while the violet faded and the lavender notes came out more. It's a pleasant, clean scent and honestly after a week of Night Music, Citricuyá, Darkfall and other heavier or \"richer\" soaps, something light and relaxing was actually very pleasant.\n\nSoap base performed as well as you would expect from a B&M, honestly it's just varying degrees of awesome. I've been shaving with the Glissant base for the last few days and despite it being a new soap, the performance was excellent. Today was the last day with the feather. It's starting to get a little rough. I'm going to try a Gillette Blue in the Rockwell next. I've heard that it works well with the Razor.\n\nI've been on a B&M kick taking photos and shaving with their soap for the last five days? I'm going to change it up tomorrow and go with some Storybook Soapworks. I like a good coffee soap. Later today I'm going into the office. I have a presentation to prepare for. I don't know about y'all, but I hate death by PowerPoint. I like to mix up my presentations, add some audio-visual effects, dummy props, and audience participation (and by participation, I don't mean taking turns reading the PowerPoint out loud. That's some bullshit right there.)\n\nAside from that, I just found out about the FB Wetshaving Enablers page and asked for access yesterday. Still haven't gotten an invite and apparently mods can only allow new members, so it's a waiting game.\n\nHave a good Tuesday!",

The aftershave felt great on my face, very soothing. I'm excited to try it with the soap as well. The EdP is very nice, especially for the price. Performance is good so far and it matches the aftershave perfectly.",

Slow this time around, only XTG on the cheeks and upper lip, didn't cause any harm. I know the correct way to use a straight is to drag it across as to slice through the hair, but maybe as I get more comfortable with angles I'll learn to incorporate it. As for now, I don't want to be slicing my check using said technique. Using a DE feels like easy mode after using a straight.\n\nLife is short, shave with good gear.\n",

Still loving the Karve OC. I'm finding some soaps don't need citric acid added to the water, like Glissant. It's actually making it worse. Don't know if I'm adding too much or I just shouldn't use any at all. The lather is getting slicker and shinier, but the volume has decreased significantly. I keep having to reload. First world problems.\n\n\nI really missed the boat with *Jacinthe.* Thankfully I got some off of the Bazaar recently. It's so nice, hope the new B&M can replace it.\n\n\n**Regarding the song:** *CLICK FOR THE AWESOME BAND NAME, STAY FOR THE ACTUAL SONG.* Seriously, it's probably not what you think. It's a dance/rock band that's synth based. They just, uhh, *happen to be called FARTBARF.*\n\n\nGreat shaves, all.",

At the time he was killing a tub of the Coconut scent. It really is a good soap with simple scents. I don't use it much in favor of my staples. What the hell, I may run with it for a while.",

The scent has really grown on me from the time I opened a sample a while back. I'm glad I got the full tub. Samples are tough sometimes.\n\nFirst time with Voskhod. I wouldn't call it a comfortable shave but it was a close one. Could have been due to my hasty prep. I'll reserve judgment for now.\n\nI'm starting to think this little Yaqi is like my wife's sister. All looks, not much personality. I've ordered another Maggard synthetic since I PIF'd mine and miss it.\n\nI'm trying my hand at taking pictures and it's been a fun learning process so far. u/Not_a_robot_101 has been very helpful with that so thank you my friend.\n\n\n",

First time with Seville. What a shave. First off, this scent is great. I understand why you guys drool over this scent regularly.\n\nWhat blew me away the most was the performance. I got an okay lather from this and the performance was simply the best I've had from any base. I was amazed in every aspect. I'm going to have to figure this base out a little bit more. It was so good that I actually immediately started looking at the other reserve soaps after my shave.\n\nHappy shaves everyone!",

It was very weakly-scented, but that seemed to fit it, in a natural way.\n\n#### ❧ Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Gillette - Aristocrat 66 - UK ::: Gillette - 7 o'clock - Blk ‹5 uses›)*\n\nI haven't used my 66 in a while, and I was reminded how nice of a shaver this was. Efficient, but very comfortable, and it sliced right through the growth.\n\nReally liked this blade. Excellent match for this razor and my skin/beard. No tugging or irritation.\n\n#### ❧ Soap Notes\n*^(LeBelle Soaps - Forest Moss)*\n\nI like this soap base. Works well and feels good on the face. Not top-tier, but they all don't need to be, do they?\n\n20 second load with lightly-wet scrubby boar brush + 3 tsp water = 4-5 passes of a very enjoyable and slick lather.\n\nScent: True to it's name, a light forest moss.\n\nScent Strength: 3-4/10, barely present during shaving.\n\nBowl - I used the XL version of this bowl:\nhttps://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3392930\n\n\n#### ❧ Brush Notes\n*^(Omega - 10098 Boar ‹10 uses›)*\n\nIt's a young stout boar. Needs a while to get comfy. Not there yet. Nuff said.\n\n#### ❧ Shave Quality\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Smooth\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Cut flush to where I just see the tips (above average for me)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm)\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

A very sweet coffee + Oud scent. It smells like coffee ice cream with a slight woodiness to it. Pretty good stuff.\n\nAlso my first try of this soap base, which (as expected) performed really well. Like other super fatted soaps it can take a fair bit of water, and dialing it in makes it brilliant!\n\nThis is a top base - further proof that there's tons of artisans who are achieving top level performance. The nice thing about this brand is the scent strengths and in general the scents are good. I also bought the Khalifa scent, so will give that a go soon.\n\nHappy Tuesday!",

On the one hand, I find the BBS here lasts less than from more aggressive razors (though BBS for 6 hours or so is still plenty fine.) On the other hand, the big ol bars make against the grain shaving pleasant and efficient, far more so than most other razors I own.\n* Even a CG L2 SB by comparison is much more irritating to use ATG and also needs more passes to clean, say, above the lip. The Marvel whisked through the nasty stubborn stubble below the nose with ease and comfort.\n* I like what Fine has done here. The big safety bars and big blade gap somehow offset and create a pleasant, highly efficient shave. The handle is still too short, given the ginormous head, and pot metal coating on the head is not at all pretty, but this is an interesting project that was executed well.\n* **Brush:** part of my \"are all synths the same?\" comparison week. The handle is lovely here, and the knot is a pleasure to use. Splays more easily than yesterday's Gamechanger ... but that is due to a more fan like shape for the Moka and less dense fiber placement vis a vis the Gamechanger. Still no compelling reason to think these fibers are each very different from the other.\n* **Frag**: A great way to straddle winter and spring, and the notes here subtly complement the traditional fougere of Reserve Fern.",

I was hoping it would calm down after the first shave like I had happen when trying a Feather blade, but no such luck. Same issues as last time and looks to be mostly in the same spots. Second shave on a blade is usually pretty good for me, but this was as bad or maybe slightly worse than the last shave. Haven't tossed the blade yet, but not sure I'm going to give it another go.\n\nMight need to take some time off shaving to let my neck heal or go to the Faux Fusion for a shave or two until things calm down. Disappointing, but perhaps these blades just don't work for me. Will try in another razor and see how they do.",

WTG, XTG, and clean up. A bit of a late afternoon start but great shave nonetheless. I'm loving all the Stirling's in my house and can't wait to test out more. Slim Twist is performing great and aftershave was on point.\n\n**The Soap** was a piece of art. What a soap. Smells fantastic, just like peeled oranges. The menthol gives it that extra chilling touch. Especially on the second pass, the lather feels luxurious and when the cold blade touches the face, mm mm Good. I had the soap months ago but haven't used it til now. Lovely one indeed.\n\n**The Razor and Blade** were great. No tug or irritation. Just smooth gliding across the face. It is a bit duller than the start but it still cuts fairly well. I think I can take this blade to 30+ uses just as an estimate. Anyways, great razor and I think I'll change it up next time just for variety sake.\n\n**The Brush** is also a piece of art. It looks amazing and performs even better. I was a bit disappointed with the knot though. Just looking at it, it has bits of stragglers and short pointed out bristles and I just don't like that look. However, the brush feels luxurious and has enough scrub to clean the face while not irritating it. This is just as I expected and I got nothing less. Also, the handle is like none other. Fits my hands perfectly and has a good heft. In conclusion, the brush is one of my favorite but the knot looks a bit shaggy.\n\n**The aftershave portion** worked well. Thayer's performs well as always. As for the balm, I didn't want to use the Ice Cold heavy-menthol balm since I already used a mentholated soap. So I went with the cooling balm and that cooled the face nicely without the heavy menthol. Lovely.\n\nOverall, a great shave. Stirling continues to amaze me with their amazing products and I can't wait to test out more of them. I'll change the razor for next shave and perhaps use the Stirling Boar one more time with a commercial soap. I'm thinking of using the Palmolive Shaving cream.",

It was 2011, summertime, and this girl who I was either in love with or just childishly infatuated with was moving across the country, likely for good. I sat in my car and I replayed some of the times we were together and some of the signs that I missed, like a hook to the jaw. There once was this one time when we were at a big house party. Before I drunkenly drove away, Dana asked me for a kiss on the cheek. I obliged and then walked out the door to drive to some other party to hang out with some girl that I didn't even like but that I *knew* had a thing for me.\n\nI still think about that night sometimes.

Brush is also doing well...it fits my scuttle nicely.\n\n\nSpeaking of Bison Base: I've noticed that it's sold out everywhere I've checked (Maggard's and DG's site). I really love the original bison base. I hope DG isn't going to change over to Icarus without any notice. Or am I just out of the loop? Ugh.\n\n\n**The Song:** I'm so beat up from listening to metal all day yesterday. Had to listen to something lighter. Can't believe this album is over 20 years old.\n\nGreat shaves all!",

I've only been shaving with a safety razor for a few months. I started with a cheap WEISHI I bought from Amazon to see if I liked it. It turns out I do! I'm not ready to spend over $50 on a razor but wanted something better than the WEISHI, so I bought the EJ from Maggard after they sent around a promo code. It's a completely different shave, and I'm very glad I bought the EJ. I won't be going back to the WEISHI.\n\nThis is also my first shave with Proraso. Previously I had just tried Maggard's London Barbershop soap. I vastly prefer the smell of the Proraso.\n\nMorning Tunes: ['Sorry You're Sick' by Ted Hawkins](https://open.spotify.com/track/02SD6aeNQIDYIGwu0Sz2Ad?si=iTLW-K8TTMO77mlxlF68sg)",

This tub of soap was one of the first artisanal soaps I ever bought. This is the OG 5oz tub. The scent has noticeably faded, but the performance is still excellent. This soap has always worked very well with my water and it really agrees with my skin. I have always gotten a really good post shave feel from it. I enjoyed it so much today that I may forgo my plans for tomorrow and use it again.",

It's a little overwhelming to me off the puck but when lathered it's awesome. I paid attention to hydration today (thanks u/wyze0ne) and was not shy with the water. Resulted in a much better shave ad lathered quite easily considering I used the boar brush.\n\nThe boar brush is slowly becoming my favourite. Lathering with it is like getting a gentle massage.\n\nPost-shave feel was fantastic. I applied a little bit of the BodyShop AS but don't think I really needed it. Skin still feels smooth this morning.\n\nAnd just like that, it's the middle of the week - I've got \"working for the weekend\" playing in my head right now...\n\nHave a good Wed folks!",

So now, I'll pull it out occasionally to see what it could and should not ever be paired with. First up: Zoologist/Chiseled Face - Civet. Two words come to mind when I smell Civet and that's sweet musk. Not bad by no means, but definitely sweet as hell. When I applied the Roam over it, I picked up far more of the splash's smoke and thyme notes than I previously had after any other use. I also ended up choosing Oddity to finish it off because i figured the spicy clove of the EdP would play well with the smokiness of the aftershave and I think I called it right. So today is definitely a win in my books.",

In fact the first statement out of here when the Small One saw the wife was \"I don't feel well.\" Dosed her up with some kids medicine last night, but those only work for 4 hours. So when that wore off I would get up and dose her again. Woke me up around 5:15 this morning coughing. Went into her room to give her another dose and she asked when it was time to get up. Took her temp: 100.8, yeah, she's not going to school. So right now she's on the couch eating crackers, drinking juice, and watching princess movies. I just hope that she's better by Monday, will probably have the wife make her a Dr.'s appt for tomorrow if she's not feeling any better by this afternoon.\n\nHave a good Wednesday everyone!",

So much that it ended up pretty drippy and kept running down my shave brush while I tried to lather my face and down my razor onto my hand while I was shaving. **Serious question for Reserve users: is that what it's supposed to be like, or did I mix it up too wet this time?** Not being sarcastic at all - just wanting to know if this is what the Reserve experience is meant to be or if I overshot this time.\n\nI like the scent. The notes are nicely balanced and the citrus seems to take a back seat... There's no big lemon or bergamot blast that I can notice, they just enhance the herbal / minty lavender and menthol. There's no actual menthol in the soap, though - just the fragrance of it. I feel like there's something else hiding in there too. Does anybody else get a sort of smokey / leathery / tobacco-y note hiding in the background with this soap? Something subtle and a little bit manly underneath everything else.\n\nThe Shark was much more comfortable today, as my face has largely recovered from my shaving disasters / endless nose-blowing last week. I would say the comfort and closeness of shave are *acceptable* and I could live with this blade if I had to, but there are better blades I could use in the same price range so I won't bother buying more. It didn't have the super-smooth/effortless feel of the Astra SP I was using last week. Not a top tier blade for me in this razor, but I'd take it over a Derby Extra any day.",

The Marvel continues to impress for its price, but the handle is less grippy than it appears if one gets it wet and / or soapy. This, plus the short size, and the pot metal head combine to make the Marvel a great $40 razor as compared to being a great razor period, a claim which some Razorocks in that same price range can aspire to due to use of better materials used.\n* **Brush:** Continuing my \"are synths different from each other?\" testing. This one definitely has a lot of personality due to size and knot density - this one is a little denser than my other Tuxes, maybe due to the size. In any case, the density helps give the big guy a unique \"badgerly\" quality of retaining warm water in its core. Usually mid size and small synths take in hot water and turn it room temp by the time it hits my face after lathering, but the massive Tuxedo here gives nice hot liquid pass through.\n* The big knot is nice in other ways - smaller face feel than might be guessed as the knot is still very orderly even after 18 months of use - no blooming or stray hairs. Splay is pretty easily induced as well.\n* But is any of this due to the unique aspects of the Tuxedo knot? I don't think so. This is just a big dense knot, and I think a 30mm Gamechanger or Mew Brown or whatever synth flavor one prefers would perform in a knot of similar density and size. So I am still a synth fiber universalist!\n* The handle is lovely here - still looks brand new, catches the light in interesting ways, pleasant to hold and use. Fine work by Dogwood!\n* **Soap**: The most accessible and pretty of SW scents I have tried so far - has a nice mix of perfumey and natural design and is a rich, complex scent that also conveys a pagan woodsiness.",

Since shaving the beard off I've been trying to use soaps and splashes that I have in my collection but didn't want to break out just to clean up my neck or cheeks and today was Vespers day to shine.\n\nThis is also my first experience with the Excelsior soap base and while I've read countless positive reviews I have to admit that my attitude was, \"how much better can it be than the existing reserve base?\" The answer for people living under a rock is a lot better. It's like those last few points of improvement might not make a practical difference but they sure do have a great result. I don't even feel like I should call this base soap because it was like shaving with moisturizer, my skin was so soft and happy after my shave that I doubt that I even needed post shave.\n",

Hooray for me! I have 3 more tubs that are close to being killed (and about 20 or so that aren't anywhere near that :/ ) so my goal is to finish those 3 sometime this year as well. Special thanks goes to u/Hyvasuomi79 for letting me borrow this beautiful and awesome shaving razor for the last week. The shaves have been amazing to say the least. However, I would also like to slap him because now I want one and they're nearly impossible to get! I would opt for a different handle though. Although the 7 is beautiful, I prefer some more knurling in the middle section. A minor gripe. Fenchurch is nowhere near a match for MR, but I just felt like using it today because it's such an awesome scent and the Dec liniment never disappoints. Face is feeling great today. Happy shaves all!",

I drink far more coffee than I should on order of at least a pot a day. I don't know how healthy that is, but I justify it in several ways including \"I'm a parent and I need my caffeine\", to \"at least it's not a Red Bull\". You would think though that with as much coffee I drink I would have gone full coffee snob. Nope, If it's coffee, I'll drink it. (Note: none of that cafe mocha, latte, fat free cream double shot bullshit.) I have no loyalty to a brand or region. Black or a little cream. That's about it.\n\nCoffee Spoons, smells like coffee to the point that I was irritated post shave when felt cheated out of some caffeine. The soap itself is a very soft, base similar in feel to Black Ship Grooming. I did a 25 second load and got a full, beautifu lather that was very slick and protective. I did not have matching AS, so I used some King of Bourbon for a nice paring. WK stuff is awesome, y'all know.\n\nI may write more later, I'm not sure. I gotta run, lots to do today. Have a goodn Wednesday.\n\nRobot",

Oh well.\n\nIn other news, I'm rather sure what I thought was a G12 scuttle is actually a G20. I bought the scuttle off of s_b years ago as a G12. Recently a friend got a G12 because I was raving about it, and when I saw his it turns out it is much smaller than mine. I'm not sure how the person on s_b wasn't aware of what they had, but I sure got a good deal. Love this thing. Hate shaving without it.",

And I return to an old friend, my Fine Italian Citrus.\n\n#### ❧ Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Timeless .95 - Scalloped Bar ::: Gillette - 7 o'clock - Blk ‹6 uses›)*\n\nThis is an edgy combo, and while quite manageable, it was not comfy on my neck during the 3rd pass in one area. I think I like the .95 with other blades a little better.\n\n#### ❧ Soap Notes\n*^(Fine Accoutrements - Italian Citrus)*\n\nCopious amounts of awesome lather! This is my first Fine soap I tried years ago. Got it in a lot purchase and really savoring it these days.\n\n30 second load with lightly-wet big soft badger brush + 4 tsp water = 6 passes of creamy slick lather. Gotta trim down this ratio!\n\nScent: Citrus with a nice light spicy twist to make it interesting.\n\nScent Strength: 5/10, nicely present during shaving.\n\nBowl - I used the XL version of this bowl:\nhttps://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3392930\n\n\n#### ❧ Brush Notes\n*^(Declaration Grooming - Carnavis and Richardson Rubberset 400 24mm ‹1 uses›)*\n\nMy first time with this guy and I was delighted to feel the easy splay and soft tips! I was afraid the loft was too short, but it was spot on! What a delight for those sweet tips to not be shoved with too much backbone!\n\n#### ❧ Shave Quality\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: A little irritating\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Few hairs are showing some tip length (with most being cut flush)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm)\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

WTG, XTG, and clean up. I didn't want to shave today but I will be gone for several days so I said why not. Felt a bit rough in the start but got better as it went on.\n\n**The Soap** worked well. As it was my first time using it, I put in double portion into the brush. That was a mistake. I had to keep dialing in water and the lather wasn't getting wet enough. I stopped at one point and just shaved with it. It was not slick enough and it skipped over my skin a tiny bit. I dialed in more in my second pass and it got a lot better. But overall, a great cream. Great scent and good performance. Post shave is a bit dry but it's expected as a commercial product.\n\n**The Razor and Blade** combination worked well. It was a bit rough in the start but that was partly because of a dry lather. Rest of it went fine without any irritation or tugging. The blade is heading to the end of its life cycle and I think it has couple uses left. The razor is pretty mild so I had a comfortable shave today.\n\n**The Brush** worked well again. It did it job well and gave me a good lather to work with. Only thing is that towards the end of the knot, there were some water dripping. I did put it in water for 20 min and started with a wetter brush. But throughout the shave, water kept dripping over my arm. I may have started with too wet of a brush so I'll try a bit drier next time. Other than that, the brush was fantastic in its performance, comfort, and handling(?).\n\n**The aftershave portion** was great. That Stirling MITA Witch Hazel is amazing. It has a milky color and when it hits the face, it feels ice cold. The menthol level is like Proraso Green level, maybe a touch colder. Great smell as well. Reminds me of a lemonade powder/vitamin C powder drink. Nivea Balm is as always good on the skin.\n\nOverall, a great shave. The cream started a bit thick due to my mistake but it got better as the shave went on. Not the closet shave but since I'll be shaving tomorrow morning, I don't need a BBS today. I'll probably use a similar set up but switch up the soap to something else. I'm thinking of using TASS Strafford Station.",

I transitioned pretty slowly with a failed start back in 2014 with some Art of Scamming junk and then restarted again in 2017. I lurked on here for a long time before commenting. My first razor was a Merkur 34c and when I transitioned, to shave soap my first was Maggard Lime and Bergamot. In fact this was one of the first wetshaving layout pictures I took.\n\n[Basic starter setup.](https://i.imgur.com/lui09zL.jpg)\n\nI'm pretty sure I found all of the recommendations by reading the guides and simple questions thread.\n\nI wanted to share this photo for a few reasons. One was the theme. I don't have a lot of dusty things. I started out very slow and used two soaps for six months before I began trading things in and out. Second was to let y'all know about impact. The wiki, side bar and question threads make a difference to people. It helped me even though I didn't comment for nearly a year. I learned how to build an optimal lather via watching Michaels YouTube channel. The same goes with Ruds and his reviews. There's an impact even if y'all don't immediately see it. So thank you.\n\nI shaved today with Bon Vivant. I'm done with it. I've given it multiple chances and the smell does not agree with me. The bitter herbs and sour orange don't do it for me. Performance is great, I just can't handle the fragrance of it. Don't get me wrong, I can see that it's a complex scent and well put together, just not for me.\n\nWork sucked yesterday. I can't go into many details; I left an hour early after I got some bad news. I grabbed some beer on the way home and then proceeded to stew in my anger and frustration for the rest of the night. I rarely bring my work home with me, but having explained the situation to my wife, she was amazingly accommodating, taking care of the kids and giving me the opportunity to have some quiet time. I really don't deserve her. For what it's worth, I think everything will be fine. It's just very frustrating when you try to look out for your staff and you get blindsided by some bullshit that could have been solved with a simple conversation in the first place.\n\nAnyhow, today is a new day. I'm going to try to put this behind me and move on.\n\nI hope y'all have a good Thursday!\n\nRobot",

Chester Bennington - Cross Off](https://youtu.be/4KdCEg7I8A0)\n\nStirling Executive Man was the first full set that I acquired. It's a crowd pleaser based on the famous fragrance Creed - Aventus. I find that this homage is more citrus forward and lacks the smokiness of the real Aventus, but still smells quite pleasant. Side note, makes my lady smell my neck non-stop, so I got that going for, which is nice.\n\n​\n\nMark Morton finally released his 10-track solo album on March 1st called \"Anesthetic.\" Mark is the co-lead guitarist for the band Lamb of God, and this song is basically a mix of Lincoln Park and Lamb of God. Chester Bennington recorded his vocals in the spring of 2017, just months before committing suicide. Rounding out the cast of this song is Alex Bent on drums and Paolo Gregoletto on bass from the band Trivium. If you have not heard the drums on the latest Trivium album, I suggest you take a peak at the monster that is [Alex Bent](https://youtu.be/poo9hYpXOtI).\n\n​\n\nThe whole album is full of guest appearances by a great mix of musicians both in metal and rock and is well worth a listen. Highlights include \"The Never\" with Testament singer Chuck Billy, \"Save Defiance\" with Alter Bridge/Slash singer Myles Kennedy and \"The Truth is Dead\" with Randy Blythee of Lamb of God and Alissa White-Gluz of Arch Enemy. It is available on your streaming platform of choice.\n\n​",

I have to say that the new scent really delivers. It's a semi-sweet, gourmand-ish type scent that reminds me of breakfast at grandmother's house (in a good way) when I was a kid. The Excelsior base is of course top notch, so the shave was very smooth and comfortable. This soap is definitely worth trying, as the fragrance is a very unusual yet fun combination of things.",

Mikes natural lathered up creamy and yogurt from the get go, with additional water generating more lather while retaining thickness. I didn't try to push the lather but I might later on. The shave was quite comfortable even though I haven't used it enough to dial in.

I was lucky to score one and the pictures don't come close to doing it justice. It's truly a work of art.\n\nHe was kind enough to throw in a sample of the upcoming Tres Matres release, and this smells great! Ruds hit the nail on the head when he described it as a masculine floral. It's not as dirty as some of their scents and might be their best scent yet in my opinion.",

Today was no exception. This soap is one of the least performing that I own. It requires about twice the loading as nearly all of my other soaps and has almost no tolerance for water. The lather isn't quite as stable as nearly all of my other soaps as well. Also, I get a slight burning sensation when I use it. Today wasn't too bad. So why do I use it at all? The scent is absolutely divine. This is my favorite tobacco scented soap. In spite of the shortcomings of this soap, I was able to get a useable lather and a resulting nice shave.",

Need to review two pharmacies we renovated last year, a hardware store that wants to add a greenhouse, a grocery store + liquor store + convenience store + carwash + gas station under construction on one large site, and assess damages at a grocery store with cracking in a load bearing wall. All in two long days with about 13 hours in the car, so I gotta look sharp for all the hand-shaking and smell mild for the car-ride.\n\nB&M Reserve Waves is of medium strength for fragrance and it's basically all top and heart notes - no lingering base to speak of after a few hours. Just a little bit of spice from the bergamot, some nice herby/leafy notes from the lavender and geranium, and some freshness from the so-called \"aquatic\" notes. This is a very '90s Gillette scent (it's based on their discontinued Wild Rain aftershave), albeit a more natural/floral rendition of that family of scents, and it reminds me of the shaving products that I used when I first started shaving. This is my favorite scent in the Reserve lineup and it pairs nicely with my Gillette after shave gel (though I didn't use that today).\n\nMy first time using Reserve I went too dry, my second time I went too wet. I aimed for the middle this time and had better results, though I don't know if it's \"perfect\" yet or not. All I can say is that my skin felt... normal after the shave. Not dry or tight or anything. I'm still unsure whether or not I'll invest in a full tub of Reserve after I finish up these samples (because I have cheaper soaps that are quicker and easier to lather), but if I do it'll be Waves.\n\nTried the Shark in my Tech today. Compared to the Super Speed, where I would just its performance as \"only acceptable,\" it was *absolutely flawless* in the Tech. No tugging, no harshness, no whiskers left over... just 100% irritation free and BBS everywhere, including problem patches. Easily a match for the Astra SP and Wilkinson Sword, or maybe even slightly better (in this razor only). Very impressed.",

I see it every day but keep meaning to put a spacer in it. It's so mild I have to check to see if there's a blade in it. I think it's 1951? No code.\n\nI've given away a lot of things so the D503 is probably my oldest soap on hand. It's a really good scent and Stirling always works for me. It's citrus, lavender, oakmoss, and some florals.\n\nI bought the brush at TJ Max a while back because why not. Never used it until today. Tiny little thing but works just fine for an in shower face lather.\n\nDecent shave today. Glad to get the 503 out again.\n\nEdit: The thing I tried with editing my photo didn't come out very well. That's how I learn.",

Also testing out SB's Daybreak and hoping another blade treats me better than yesterday. Trouble though, was that I couldn't use my tapwater for very much due to a water system maintenance warning they put out today. Ack.\n\n#### ❧ Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Timeless .95 - Scalloped Bar ::: Astra - Platinum ‹12 uses›)*\n\nYesterday's .95 razor was a little rough on my neck during the last pass and I didn't enjoy it. It was with a Gillette 7oclock Black and today was about checking this razor out with another blade. Big success. The comfort level was back to where I remember it being, and it was a joy to use this razor again. Great combo of razor and blade for those whose skin and beard resemble mine.\n\nNo tugging or irritation.\n\n#### ❧ Soap Notes\n*^(Stubble Buster - Daybreak)*\n\nGeneralImpression\n\n50 second load with long and soft, lightly-wet boar brush + 3.5 tsp water = 4 passes of super slick, wet lather. I wouldn't go any wetter, and might reduce the water ratio just a bit for more creaminess next time.\n\nScent: was a bit odd. might have been clashing with another scent in my bathroom. Undetermined. Will have to try again.\n\nScent Strength: 3-4/10, very lightly present during shaving. Pretty much par for the course for SB soaps.\n\nBowl - I used the XL version of this bowl:\nhttps://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3392930\n\n\n#### ❧ Brush Notes\n*^(Semogue - 2000 Boar ‹1 uses›)*\n\nFirst use of this new one. He's a different Semogue, so I think I will add him to the boar-a-thon rotation.\n\nDid so well out of the block. Held plenty of soap, felt great on the face: no scritch, but a little scrub, and softness too.\n\n#### ❧ Shave Quality\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Cut flush to where I just see the tips (above average for me)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm)\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

It was legit fascinating. Also, I am not proud of the travel shave setup I took with me, so there will be no posting of my SOTDs for Monday and Tuesday. But when I got home yesterday, I had packages waiting from Chatillon Lux, Maggard, and WCS.\n\nThis morning, I decided to shave with the Mammoth Soaps Almond Leather. Off the puck, I get a very sweet/candy/marzipan almond smell and not much leather. When I lathered up, a funky leather scent started to appear. The aftershave seems to be a nice balance between the sweet almond smell and a less funky leather.\n\nI paired it up with CL's Biblio. I know u/hawns said it would be like this, but it still blows my mind that it is like this... it opens with the smell of dryness. I don't know how something can smell dry, but it smells like dry. A liquid came out of that bottle and when that liquid hit me it smelled like dry. Mind. Blown. The dryness has now opened up into a more dry old paper type smell with a bit of musty old leather underneath. So far so good.",

This was not a pleasant shave - I nicked myself in on my chin and neck, so a couple of weepers. Post shave, in this case also included some polysporin. lol.\n\nRest of the items worked well enough. SBS Brain Break scent reminds me of \"Yardley English\" talcum powder. Soap performs well usually although it didn't feel like it with this razor. The yaqi brush was so-so. Seems like this knot is too deep in the handle so it wasn't as easy as the Stirling synthetic for face lathering - also not as nice as the tuxedo knots.\n\nI was hoping to keep the DE89 as a backup but it's more likely heading into the PIF pile.\n\nHappy Pi Day folks - tonight, I'm heading to watch the Raptors play the Lakers. So pumped for my first NBA game since 2015!",

Combo of Vokshod in the Marvel makes the blade feel as if it's losing sharpness more rapidly than the norm. Between that and the stubby, slippery when wet handle of the Marvel. I think this combo is at the end of its lifespan.\n* The Marvel seemed excellent at first, and still gives a wondrously gentle shave given its very good though not great efficiency and immense blade gap. However, the handle only looks good, and becomes very slippery when even modestly moist. Plus as always with pot metal heads, the fear of dropping returns to the shave, an aggravating factor when the handle is already a weak point. All in all, the Marvel is an interesting design and a decent budget razor, but I can't see revisiting it with any frequency.\n* **Soap:** The scent is pretty decent - plum, amber, and tobacco leaf. It's not quite my cup of tea as any hint of fruitiness usually is not. Performance was excellent though - in the same ballpark as WK DM and Excelsior. That brown spot though -- hm, no easy answers there!\n* **Brush:** Cashmere is very soft and splayable, probably from the mid range density and high loft of the fiber rather than due to the fiber material itself. A very pleasant shave, and the efficiency of the design is excellent. Plus plenty more backbone than the average Plissonitator of yesteryear.\n* **Frag:** A classic, powdery rose and orange with some leather notes in the base. Very versatile and great longevity!",

This razor is still good but I don't find it as efficient as the timeless and not sure if it just in my head but I feel blade chatter or instability when doing my across the grain passes.This badger brush is great and in some aspects I like it more than my Paladin but I had to switch because it sheds hair every single shave and I bought it back in 2015! This is my oldest soap/aftershave as I bought it in 2016; love the scent but I learned with this set and few others that my face does not like alcohol based splashes as I always break out when I use this. This soap is actually next on my kill list so I can feel free to order it in Excelsior base and Deltus formula. Now back to my bed as I've been in cold mode all week and finally decided to take a day off from work. Time to catch up on some reading.",

Finished off with Karve, but honestly there wasn't a whole lot to pick up. My first soap from Mammoth, worked very well for my first lather with the base. Scent is terrific and is exactly as described. Biblio was an excellent match for the Almond Leather.\n\n​\n\nBiblio opens with a dry, musty scent, but transitions to leather and vanilla soon after. Strength and sillage is quite good so far, 8 hours in and going strong. The dry down is where this scent shines, where the cedar comes to the forefront while the leather supports from the background. I'll be interested to see what other soaps I can match with this fragrance.\n\n​\n\nDemon Hunter released their newest double album War & Peace on March 1st. I've been a fan of the band for a long time, and it's one of the rare groups that I have never been able to see live. I feel the same about this double album as I do about all double albums. If they would've taken the best songs from both to make only one album, it would be great. Peace has a lot of slower songs and gets pretty boring where War has the heavier side. It makes sense thematically, but they really should be interwoven in a singular story as not to make me want to change the track. Close Enough is my favorite track so far and starts with a Zakk Wylde type riff and has a Zakk Wylde a la Ozzy solo. Hard to go wrong with both of those influences. Still worth checking out if you're more of a hard rock opposed to metal person.",

I had a crummy day yesterday. Many of you commented on my post with encouragement as well as a few PM's. Thank you for the support. It meant a lot.\n\nI got some new shave gear in today. The first was a lightly used Karve courtesy of /u/rocketk455 and the second was a small lot of soaps from /u/thefourohfour. The lot included a set of 42, Chiseled Face / Zoologist \"Panda\" and something very special I'll be shaving with at a later date. I'm pretty excited about it, but I want to get some time to really gather my thoughts about it before do a SOTD.\n\nSo today I shaved with my new Karve. It's an absolutely beautiful razor and just a pleasure to hold. Today was only my first go, but I found the B plate to be a mild and easy shave. I was surprised when I looked up the blade gap and saw that it was comparable to a 5 plate on a Rockwell. For those of you that also have the Razorock GC with the .84, what did you prefer between the 6s, GC and Karve?\n\nMy actual shave was with CF/Zoologist Panda. After talking to /u/Ugmug yesterday, I decided to switch it up and try a face lather. I need some practice but with a little work managed to get a nice, slick three passes out of the soap. Zoologist Panda is described as having a green fragrance that combines bamboo, zisu leaves, sichuan peppers, osmanthus flowers, mandarin and blooming lilies.\n\nI expected a fougere and instead It's this odd mix between a fougere and aquatic scent with floral hints and a fair amount of musk. Y'all may think I'm crazy, but I found the musk to be more present in Panda then I do Night Music. It's actually a great scent, just not what I expected. After the shave I looked up some reviews on it and /u/res2wedge said that Panda fell into the realm of a chypre fragrence. I've never tried a chypre before so I can't comment if this the case.\n\nWith no matching aftershave, I fell back on my Black Ship Grooming \"Philips Fougere\" to play up the green notes. It was very pleasant and just a really nice shave.\n\nOn the personal front, I had a day off today. I went to Home Depot with my family, picked up stuff for Easter and made some plans to visit the Monterey Aquarium. My father was a big fan of Steinbeck so it would be cool to see Cannery Row. I've see pictures of the giant glass wall tank. I think my daughter would really love it.\n\nHave a Good Friday Y'all\n\nRobot",

The M2 is one of the mildest heads but had no problem with 3 days growth.\n\nLast night was entertaining, my wife needed her legs shaved, typically I do the lather while she equips the DE. Problem being that she's vastly underexperienced and overconfident with it. Couple that with a fresh blade and even with my mildest razor, there was bloodshed. You know how they say the rule of thumb is a 30 degree angle? Well she shaves with it damn near 70 degrees, and I am cringing thinking of the irritation she's getting. Doesn't matter how many times I correct her, she claims she \"can't feel\" the blade cutting anything. No fewer than a dozen cuts on her left leg alone. I was in charge of her right leg (not the knee though, FTS), and no blood lost. The alum block was her friend that night.\n\nLife is short, shave with good gear.\n",

Good thing IDGAF about following conventional protocols. I pretty much do wtf I want. The Icarus base ain't no joke. This was a good choice to follow up yesterday's soap. The contrast is very evident. The performance is stellar. The post shave feel is excellent. I thought I might have overloaded, I had no trouble adding enough water. I still had quite a bit left in the brush so I just put that on my face while I cleaned up the sink.\n\nI am a confirmed boar fan. This is known. However, this brush is truly amazing. Every time I use it I like it more and more. It is likely to knock off my Semogue 610 for my favorite brush overall. Now for most folks that is a \"Well duh!\" comment. But it's a really significant comment for a boar guy to make. That is an indication of just how good this B6 brush is.\n\nBeware the Ides of March.",

First up was Tres Matres and that scent is now up in the top tier of scents for me. This is seriously a wonderfully blended floral goodness. I can appreciate the sweetness as it's mixed in with a healthy dose of a dirt accord. I'll definitely be getting a set of this before too long.\n\nNow, I didn't have a matching splash or fragrance, so I went with the two main scent types I picked up. For the aftershave, I went with Mammoth's Funny Valentine for the hit of sweet and then B&M's Fougere Gothique for that dirtiness and I really enjoy the way they play off of each other.",

The initial scent from the tub is blended very well that I got equal whiffs of both rose and grapefruit. The tangerine and sugar scent began to come out once I began to add water. I couldn't make out any other scents but I'm sure they are there. Overall this is a very fun soap and the Excelsior soap and Deltus aftershave bases are absolutely fantastic.",

I've been using the Parker kit (99R / Black Badger brush) I first got when deciding to explore wetshaving a little less than a year ago. I have to focus much more with that razor for a quality shave. The maggard brush whipped up great lather in no time at all and this V3 was incredibly forgiving. Pretty sure this maggard combo gave me the best shave of my life. Very happy I switched up my hardware. If only razors and brushes smelled as good as the software side of things - I may have tried something different sooner.\n\n​\n\nHope everyone has a great Friday!",

The scent was perfect for the windy rainy weather last night.\n\nAnyway, TGIF and all that.",

The handle is a bit large, but is pretty. This was my first use of one of Dean's knots. Medium density, solid backbone, soft, but with a decent amount of scritch. It's a solid performing badger knot. Dusk is incredible as always, though I could have loaded a bit more. I blame not being used to the knot yet.",

She was very pleased with the situation. My wife and I, however, were caught slightly unawares and had to scramble to ensure the Tooth Fairy would have sufficient folding money to ensure the little one's expectations would be met when she woke up in the morning. Luckily, I was able to locate a couple of dollar bills. I made the swap this morning on my way downstairs for coffee. The kid nearly woke up, but I think I got away with it. Also, I need to figure out what to do with the tooth in my pocket because I really don't want to carry it to work.\n\nGreat shave this morning with the GTB and Karve C plate. I know I'm going to have to make GTB a more regular part of my routine if I want to kill it this year. Maybe I'll start doing Ghost Town Tuesdays or something.\n\nAlso sad to report that my sneak peak SBS Bell Ringer bath bar has dwindled away to nothing after approximately 2.5 weeks of daily use. I imagine if I was actually using it as a shampoo bar, it would have lasted longer. But, as a head shaver, I have very little use for shampoo. Luckily, April 3 is just a few weeks away.",

Goal for today was to test the new tiny shave bowl i got to replace my old VDH mug that broke. Forgot how dense this brush was. Dense to the point where it soaked up most of the lather. i did not even need to go back to the bowl to finish the shave. Still a good buy though. Will need to experiment with other brushes.\n\n​",

I got the Karve a couple weeks ago and the [Dogclaration](https://imgur.com/gallery/4gG6dFd) brush came in on Wednesday. It's my first Dogwood Handcrafts brush and my first Declaration knot. I fricken love it.\n\nI have struggled with getting good shaves since I started wetshaving about a year and a half ago. I still get irritation on my neck to this day and have almost given up a handful of times. Reading your guys' responses to posts on here about people struggling with the exact same issues kept me going and optimistic. I got so fed up with the irritation that last week I went back to basics and started doing just two WTG passes, and promised myself I would not change a thing about the kit I was using (with the exception of my new brush).\n\nToday's shave was probably the best shave I've ever had. This was the second day of using the B7 knot, and it is leagues above any knot I've used. The 26mm knot feels incredible coming from a 23mm SOC. The knot seems to hold so much more lather and water, and it produced one of the most slickest lathers I've used. No tugging or skipping like I always get, which is no doubt causing my irritation.\n\nEven though it was just two WTG passes (I know I'm a noob) I got zero irritation and no redness on my neck. I believe I could call it a Damn Fine Shave. The CB is incredibly smooth and efficient. I feel much more comfortable using it over my ATT S1 and Rockwell, both of which I will be letting go if the CB continues to outperform them for me.\n\nThank you to /u/whiskyey for talking me into getting the B7 and to everyone else answering my noobie questions. /u/AgtSmithBlack, I'll post a pic of the gelling once I get a couple more shaves after breaking it in. It feels incredible already.\n\nFeelin good today.",

Perhaps it's the density of the brush, or maybe the fact that it's a 26mm (most of my brushes are 24), but it seems to require more than my customary 30 second load. Think I'll go for closer to a minute and see how that turns out. As always, am open to other suggestions.\n\nHappy Friday!\n\n\n\n\n",

Oh. My. God. I now understand the hype around Excelsior and Deltus. This soap was so slick and so protective, it has instantly jumped into the top 2 for me, and possibly the very top. The thing that struck me the most was how *soft* it is. I squeeze the lather out of my brush for a cleanup pass after my normal WTG, XTG, ATG passes, and I don't really think I have ever noticed a soap's softness in my hand before. This soap was silk-blanket soft. Unbelievable.\n\nAnd the scent. Oh boy the scent. I get an equally strong mix of the Rose and Grapefruit, and maybe a little lemon in there. That might be the dryer sheets though. The sugar cookie is definitely there, but in the background to my nose. It is wonderful. Absolutely brings me back to my childhood when my grandma and grandpa had rose bushes that were in full bloom in the middle of the summer.\n\nAn extraordinary piece of work by /u/BostonPhotoTourist\n\nHappy Shaves Y'all!",

West wind 5 to 15 mph, with gusts as high as 30 mph. High tide at7:58 this evening.\n\nFirst morning shift that I've had in a while. Went with a setup that I could sleep through using. I would have to agree with /u/maddingersyo about using a synth. It's there, it gets the job done, but it just doesn't have the personality that a badger or a boar has. The handle on the brush is a bit small for my tastes, but it does add a little bit of character to the shave. Along with the age, it's also the first PIF that I won, so I will be keeping it around.\n\nThe soap is getting dialed in more and more as I use it. Just for this reason I would recommend to both new and veteran users to stick with one base for a few days or more and see how your lathers improve. But using a synth reminds me another reason I prefer natural fibers, they use up more soap. I have enough soap to choke a ~~horse~~ giraffe, the last thing I need is a brush that is so lather efficient that a tub will last me 4-5 months.\n\nThe frag was acquired at the same time I purchased Biblio. I also got Rose Santal, and Santal Auster. hawns also was kind enough to add samples of Gratoit League Square and Unconditional Surrender. I've been wearing Lamplight Penance for about 30 minutes now and the initial blast of lamp oil is just starting to fade and the scent is really blooming. It will probably become a full bottle purchase. Makes me wish I got the soap and A/S too, but see the above statement about the amount of soap I have as to why I'm glad I didn't.\n\nHave a nice Saturday everyone!",

I just received the aftershave from Maggard's the other day and boy was I missing out. Noble Otter's aftershave is one of the best as far as performance and scent. This is another example of a scent that you have to have the soap and splash to truly enjoy it.\n\n​\n\nThis is my favorite Nevermore song.

It was a surprise as I thought I was slated to go in on Saturday night, but I was already getting prepared to switch to a night shift, so it wasn't a terrible lift.\n\nToday's shave was Sakura Musk by WSC / Dr. Jon. I missed out on the T + S \"Kyoto\" a while back and when I had the chance to trade for some Sakura I jumped on the opportunity. Trythatsoap describes the fragrance as a blend of Japanese cherry blossom, white musk and amber for a sweet and smokey scent.\n\nHonestly, today wasn't a great shave. I tried the Marco method after reading some people raving about it on here. Water and wet lather was going everywhere. It was a mess and I coulden't dial in a solid lather like I'm used to. Into the second pass with my Karve, I ended up nicking myself. Its been a few weeks since I've done that with a DE and I attribute it to poor, overly wet lather on my part.\n\nI still toughed it out and got through three passes. I can't say I loved the scent. I like amber and musk, but I diden't get much smoke or amber out of the scent. Mostly it was cherry blossom. It felt a bit one dimensional. I might be biased after my terrible job with the Marco method and it tinged my impression. I'll give it a few shaves and feel it out. It's not bad, its just that after comming off of Chiseled Face / Zoologist Panda yesterday, this was a very liner scent.\n\nIn other news, I sadly missed out on [u/blufury1](https://www.reddit.com/user/blufury1)'s Unicorn Ivory Franklin on /r/Shave_Bazaar. I've been hunting for a Declaration Grooming Unicorn Ivory brush for a while. I'm sure another opportunity will come at some point, but if you find yourself looking to sell one and you read this, PM me. I did however manage to get his full set of Night Music. I love that stuff. Seriously, I love this stuff. Wearing it makes me feel like I'm [Dirk Diggler.](https://media.giphy.com/media/l1J9OmYu2cYKz8ZAA/giphy.gif) This is the first and *\"probably only\"* time I will double up on a soap, but this hobby has a way of making me a liar, so you never know. What do y'all think about keeping a backup of your favorite soap?\n\nLast but not least, I stopped into the wetshave IRC for the first time earlier today. There were some deep questions being asked, and y'all know how to make a guy feel *special.* /u/wyze0ne, /u/Spankmeister88 and everyone else in IRC, thanks for that, I think...",

I think I like it. understated. green, a little floral, but manly still, IMO.\n\nScent Strength: 5/10, present during shaving.\n\nBowl - I used the XL version of this bowl:\nhttps://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3392930\n\n\n#### ❧ Brush Notes\n*^(Semogue - 1250 Boar ‹10 uses›)*\n\nwonderful. not floppy, but soft tips and great splay. Hard to find too many split tips at this point, so it's surprising that it is so comfortable.\n\n#### ❧ Shave Quality\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Smooth\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Cut flush to where I just see the tips (above average for me)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm)\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

I'm headed across my state which is half under water right now. Also my first shave with my new Dogwood brush. /u/phteven_j and or /u/johnb413 named this beautiful brush 'kyle' which essentially meant I had to buy it. It was also the perfect chance to try out the Maggard SHD knot. This knot takes all the best qualities of the Maggard 2 band and Maggard Silvertip and combines them in to one amazing knot. Is it good enough to take on a Declaration knot, no probably not, but it's an excellent value for the price.",

I refuse to soak my soap or load a soaking brush. I don't like the mess. After watching videos and reading reviews, I said F it, I'm doing it my way. Damp brush load for about 40 spins. Wipe up the proto lather and stick that on the brush too. In the shower I washed up and started to lather. I thought, now this is properly overloaded the way I'm used to. Keep adding water until it felt right. It's a bit messier than other soaps but looked and felt right. Perfect for the shower. I got an amazingly slick lather and the scent is great to me.\n\nAfter I was done, I thought I'd add some more water just for science. The soap broke down into the soupy nightmare I experienced the first time. I felt satisfied that I had lathered correctly.\n\nBy the time I was done drying off, my skin felt tight and dry. I applied some Stirling balm and realized I had the smoothest, softest post shave skin to date. I couldn't stop rubbing my cheeks. I'm sure four face lathers will make the skin feel tight with any soap. Regardless, I'm a fan.\n\nHave a great weekend",

Stellar combo as usual - it just hits the right buttons for me. Who needs fancy unicorn tallow soaps when this stuff is easily available, and hopefully will be forever (I hope Proraso heard that).\n\nThe Durham Duplex, the world's first commonly available \"shavette\" (from 1907 or 1909) is a strange little beast. Even with a sharp blade, it tugs a bit. Today's blades are still carbon steel, but are meant for pet grooming, so the edge is built more for longevity than sharpness. I like my blades dull and buttery smooth, so it works for me. The results, however, defy logic. A shavette blade that tugs usually needs an extra pass for me, but this one gave me a smooth as glass shave without the extra pass. The guard on this razor is built in such a way that I couldn't cut myself if I tried. It's nice to have diversity in razors.",

Lathered up perfectly on the first try, so no complaints there. The scent is medium strong off the puck but mild in use. Piacenza this is not, despite their citrus / rosemary / lavender similarities and occasional comparisons. Piacenza puts the citrus right up front as you shave, particularly the orange; Seville focuses more on the herb and spice. I'd say rosemary is the star here, with some support from the lemon, bergamot, and lavender. While Piacenza dries down to musky flowers for hours and hours, Seville was almost gone after rinsing my face, leaving just a subtle spicy / woody / powdery drydown from the oakmoss and patchouli. This stuff could be paired with any fragrance you want. It's not a heavy hitter that's going to interfere or play with your cologne. It left my face feeling pretty good too - not dry or tight. I can't decide whether I'll invest in a full tub or not, but only because I'm not sure it would get as much use as my more strongly-scented Stirlings.\n\nGave the Shark a chance in the Edwin Jagger, even though I'm not a fan of the DE8x head geometry. (Too pokey.) Just wanted to see how they paired up. Turns out they are an excellent match! The Shark + Tech was pretty much perfect for me and this was just barely a step below that. BBS everywhere, zero irritation. I still prefer the feel of the Tech against my skin over the Edwin Jagger though.",

It was surprisingly more comfortable during the shave, but had a little neck irritation, although it went away in a few minutes. Appears to be a closer shave, but that could have been because i'm getting used to the weight, idk.\n\nI had gotten a sample of SW Grapefruit, but hadn't used it, was kinda going to sit on it until summer. Did not realize how much i'd like my face slathered in Grapefruit, but I did. Will need to pick up a tub of this or something similar in the near future, I think. Delor de Treget was a great pairing with it, too.",

Once again, I went BBS only because it was an enjoyable shave. At this point, I'm not even sure if I want to try different AC blades because these feathers have been making it too easy to mow down whatever growth I have. I'll continue using these just to test the longevity of the blade because single edge blades are supposed to last a bit longer. Blade longevity hasn't really been an issue for me lately with DEs, but I think I'm going to enjoy testing this current blade. Anyway, enough of my rambling. Have a happy Sunday, folks!",

PATRICK'S DAY\n\nI realized that yesterday, it must have sounded like I was bagging on Dr. Jon's Sakura Musk. That could not have been farther from the truth. The fact is, yesterday I tried doing too much at once. I made too many changes to my normal routine, and in turn my shave suffered for it. That is in no way the fault of the Dr. Jon's soap base. As you guys can see, today is a repeat of the same soap from yesterday. What I chose to do, was go back and instead of using the Karve, or a fresh blade, or the Marco method, I went back to using things I was very comfortable with. I used my Maggard's razor with a three shave Astra and I bowl lathered, resulting in a much improved shave.\n\nI think there is something to be said for in trying to do too much too fast. Familiarity with your razor, soap and brush all add up towards how enjoyable a shave you have. Today's shave felt more \"comfortable\", I was much more familiar with my hardware and my lather technique was improved. In turn, I found that I had a much more enjoyable shave. Sakura Musk lathered very easily and the lather as a whole was much more dense and cushioning thanks to me being able to dial in the amount of water. Because of this I found slickness and moisturizing levels were also improved.\n\nSpeaking of improvements, I think that the Marco method and my inability to dial in the water somehow affected the overall scent of the soap. Today I could pick out a little bit more amber and musk that I thought was lacking yesterday. Also, rather than the scent being very linear in nature I found it actually changed a little bit during the course of the shave. Personally, I'm really glad that everything turned out the way that it did. I read some of the comments both here and on wicked edge that encourage me not to give up after one shave with the soap. For those of you that commented on it, you were absolutely right.\n\nIn other news, my days are all screwed up. I am back working nights, and so in the last 24 hours I've actually shaved twice. My second shave was B&M 42. I don't have any photos of it but it was a really good shave. I actually forgot how lemon forward 42 is. I was asking a simple question's thread, for a good lemon-based soap. I got a lot of really good recommendations there, and someone mentioned 42. Yeah, I forgot how much I liked it. Lemons first then after about 30 minutes the lemon starts to fade away and you get some ambergris and petunia for this really nice sort of aquatic floral scent with some died off citrus hits. It wasn't that straight up lemon that I was originally looking for, but yea it's it's great.\n\nFinally, I'm coming into a couple of days off. I was never able to make it to the Monterrey aquarium with my daughter so I think that's going to be slated for Monday. Later today, after I get off work, I'm going to go take a nap and the have dinner with my family and some friends. It was great talking to you all, have a great Sunday and stay classy!\n\nRobot",

It's more forgiving than the r41 that I've been using recently, at the cost of a slightly less close shave. It's not far off though, and for a first run I was very impressed. Less irritation than the r41 also.\n\nAlbion is.. interesting. I found it a bit floral while shaving, but the hints of grapefruit I've got from it since then have been rather pleasant. Not an immediate favourite but I will be coming back to it for sure.",

Noble Otter has risen to the apex of my den, magnificent scents and performance. Rose Santal is an excellent compliment to the soap, great performance out of an EdT.\n\n​\n\nDevil You Know, now known as Light the Torch, is fronted by none other than Howard Jones. Howard was the second lead singer for Killswitch Engage and in my opinion, was their best singer. The Way We Die is a great example of what this band is capable and is much heavier than their most current offering.",

Broke out a new soap for me in *Haverford*. What a terrific scent. And those that allegedly have a difficult time lathering Stirling Soap, I can't help you. This soap is like any other quality soaps I own - easy to lather with no \"special\" trick. I mean, u/a_lfredus gets fantastic results with Stirling Soap and he uses only soaps that produces a premium, high quality lather.\nI think a good match to the soap is *Bvlgari Black* and would also pair it with L'Occitane *Baux* even though those have a leather and/or balsamic accord.\nGreat Sunday shaves to all.",

Is a cheap option, and worked okay on first shot. And I'm continuing with my Boar-a-thon.\n\n#### ❧ Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Karve - Christopher Bradley A Plate ::: Feather ‹29 uses›)*\n\nSome tugging on first pass. Was just 24 hr growth, so maybe is old Feather, or the soap. Will try to figure out that on next shave.\n\n#### ❧ Soap Notes\n*^(Dove - Men+Care Bar Extra Fresh)*\n\nWorkable, but no creaminess like I get with Yardley or Shugar Soapworks.\n\n40 second load with soft, lightly-wet boar brush + 3.5 tsp water = 5-6 passes of lather.\n\nScent: After the fact, is starting to wear on me a bit. just a strong soapy, fresh, zesty scent.\n\nScent Strength: 6/10, very present during shaving.\n\nBowl - I used the XL version of this bowl:\nhttps://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3392930\n\n\n#### ❧ Brush Notes\n*^(Semogue - 1305 Boar ‹10 uses›)*\n\nAwesome little guy. So comfy so early in life.\n\n#### ❧ Shave Quality\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: A little irritating\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Cut flush to where I just see the tips (above average for me)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm)\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

I wasn't expecting to like grapefruit because I don't like to eat grapefruit. But when I was sniffing the samples, the grapefruit just smelled so good and clean and citrus-y that I couldn't resist.\n\nThe ShaveScore(tm) of 92 is spot on. Great slickness, great post-shave feel, and at $15 for a 4oz tub, that gives it a ShaveValue of 98 (compared to Sebum Gold's ShaveValue of 37).\n\nWell done, SW!",

Went back to the Rockwell 6S for this one and stayed on R4, even though I had three days of growth.\n\nWhat an amazing shave. The lather was slick, the razor was smooth and the blade didn't hesitate at all even for its 15th shave! Kinda surprised myself considering I only got the 6S less than a couple months ago. Don't think i could go back to the DE89.\n\nLather was nicely dialed in - didn't even need an AS. Really nice weekend shave. Skin feels smooth and clean this morning too.\n\nHave a good Sunday folks!",

WTG/XTG with the straight and just a few touch up spots with the Karve. I stropped extra and I think it added to the smoothness of the shave. The soap lathered well and performed admirably. My first time using Siliski Soaps and have many more uses left of this generous sample. The scent was pleasant, but not a favorite.\n\nYRP is a delightful scent and went well with the sandalwood aftershave. The initial blast of Yuzu stuck with me for a few hours and now finally have a earthy rose accord accompanied by the patchouli. I may have enjoyed the Rose Santal a little more, but both would be worth picking up.\n\nWho doesn't need a little Viking Metal in their lives? Amon Amarth puts out great album after great album. Great riffs and they stick to their lyric theme.",

This was my first chance to try anything by Southern Witchcrafts and I was very pleased with my shave. Pomona is a vegan soap and sometimes vegans don't provide great performance. That was not the case here. Pomona was pretty thirsty, but once I have it enough water, it lathered well and game plenty of cushion and slickness. I made it through three passes without any irritation and my Karve was able to glide easily.\n\nScent is always subjective. I found the scent to be medium on the puck and it remained that way throughout the shave. Post shave the scent lasted about and hour and a half to two hours. Pomona smells of spiced apple cider and Cabernet. I would place the scent as more fall leaning in line with B&M Nocturn, while being more sweet and less smokey.\n\nPost shave feel was good. I think you could get away without AS for this soap. I still elected to play up the apple scent and I reached for B&M Nocturne.\n\nIn other news I saw Captain Marvel yesterday. No spoilers, but I thought it was a good movie and will tide me over until Avengers: Endgame. If your on the fence about seeing it, I think it's worth it. Also, expect to see more photos with fog or mist in then next few weeks. I took a bunch of photos with some dry ice and will be posting them over the coming weeks.\n\nHave a good Monday!\n\nRobot",

Finally got through one with only one weeper. I don't rember who gave me the most sage advice, but it was \"Go slow.\" Very wise.\n\nI'm a little nervous that I look like a skin head. FYI, I'm blonde and have blue eyes. In my past, I shaved my entire head twice (both in the same month). It didn't bother me. But currently, I left the top hair. My girlfriend says I look militaristic, but I still worry. I'm going to be doing a little shopping today locally. I'll let you know if anyone hands me a manifesto.\n\n\nThe lather was great.\n\n\nI have mixed feelings about the aftershave. I definitely like it. Feels good, smells good. I just don't get any sense of vanilla or tobacco. I've never smelled the Tom Ford scent that it's modeled after, so I don't know what to make of it. It smells more like citrus to me. C'est la vie.\n\n\n**The song:** This song (and pretty much the entire album it's from) is in no hurry to get where it's going. But once it gets on the freeway, it stays really strong and steady.

West wind 5 to 10 mph, with gusts as high as 20 mph. High tide at 10:00 tonight.\n\n**Brush:** I got this brush late August last year when a member of our community, who knew I was looking for a B4, graciously offered me theirs before they put it up on the Bazaar. I didn't really pay attention to the feel, other than it was soft. I was more paying attention to how the soap performed.\n\n**Soap:** So I admit that I haven't spent the time with Icarus that others have, but I have learned that it performs better when allowed to bloom. So I allowed it to bloom when I got out of the shower while doing my pre-shave routine. Shook the brush out and loaded. Loaded great, but I think next time I will try blooming and going with the Marco Method.\n\n**Scent:** Ever since I first smelled Vide Poche I loved it. The first run of soap by Tallow & Steel was done for a small group of friends, it wasn't made widely available, until August 1st or last year. I jumped on the chance to get a tub. It's great, sweet floral scent. Lamplight Penance brings a certain darkness to the whole get up, and goes very well with Vide Poche.\n\nHope you have a nice Monday eveyrone!",

I probably need more practice on the B&M soaps, but I think Cella is both easier and quicker to lather... and the quality of lather is nicer to me. More like good whipped cream. B&M never seems to reach that same density for me... by the time it's properly hydrated it's always way thinner. Post-shave, the B&M soaps leave my face feeling a bit more moisturized... but post-after-shave-balm I don't feel much of a difference.\n\nAfter good results with the Shark in my Tech and Edwin Jagger, I decided to give it another chance in my Super Speed. Nope, it did not work as well as it did in the 3-piece razors. Oh well! Not every blade is going to perform brilliantly in every razor. I know I can confidently use up the rest of these blades in my Tech, but they won't be going back into my Super Speed again.\n\nA classic green / soapy fragrance today seems appropriate for work today with spring right around the corner. The first time I smelled Paco Rabanne I wasn't much of a fan, but I have to say that this stuff grew on me after a few samplings. It's better on skin than on a sample card, and it's nice when *lightly* applied. Good casual / office scent as long as you don't over-apply.",

Seems to have reasonable post shave as well.\n\n#### ❧ Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Karve - Christopher Bradley A Plate ::: Astra - Platinum ‹13 uses›)*\n\nMaybe it was the Feather that didn't agree with the A plate of the CB razor yesterday, but today's Astra felt great. Very good combo. Quick, clean, comfy cut.\n\nNo tugging or irritation.\n\n#### ❧ Soap Notes\n*^(Dove - Men+Care Bar Extra Fresh)*\n\nAs far as a cheap soap goes, it is not quite as good as Yardley or Shugar Soapworks, but a bit more manly smelling, and a better performer than Irish Spring. I was able to make an enjoyable, though fairly high-structure lather.\n\n40 second load with soft, lightly-wet boar brush + 2.25 tsp water = 4 passes of inexpensive, yet enjoyable, and very capable lather.\n\nScent: Scent didn't bother me on second use. just a soapy, fresh, zesty scent.\n\nScent Strength: 4-5/10, present during shaving.\n\nBowl - I used the XL version of this bowl:\nhttps://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3392930\n\n\n#### ❧ Brush Notes\n*^(Semogue - 2000 Boar ‹2 uses›)*\n\nexpanding and comfy. Already a large splay.\n\n#### ❧ Shave Quality\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Smooth\n*Neck*: Smooth\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Cut flush to where I just see the tips (above average for me)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm)\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

If you stare at it long enough youd probably get a passable lather, it smells great, it's one of the slickest soaps I've used, not ultra cushiony, but damn fuckin slick. I didnt know why people stopped using it! And then I rinsed my face off. Worst. Postshave. Ever. My face was as dry as salt lake city on a sunday night. I'd planned on using some apr fougere bourbon rose splash, NOPE FUCK ALCOHOL. And doubled up on pdp balm. Its not a bad soap, Just make sure you have a good balm if you use it.",

Case in point Cryogen. Face meet Cryogen, Cryogen meet Face. Cryogen is what I would call my abusive relationship of the wetshaving world. I have my side chicks (see Seville, YRP and NeV) yet somehow I keep coming back to Cryogen, despite knowing that she is going to make me cry and leave me broken with a face howling for succor.\n\nLike Ron Swason, Cryogen is my Tammy. I keep swearing that I am over her. No joke, I've sold or traded Cryogen twice.. and yet here I am.\n\nI suppose I should give you the rundown.\n\nThe brain is a funny thing. It's like it somehow forgets pain. Mine did, at least it did until I got the first punch of menthol. It starts off slow but slowly gets colder and colder, like the fucked up ice ghost pepper of the shaving world. There were some tears and I might have cussed a little. Got a fantastic shave though, couldn't feel a thing.\n\nMy daughter is having growing pains right now. She gets terrible leg pain in the middle of the night and we usually apply a little Icy-hot during her episodes to help. Well two nights ago while we are asleep, kiddo had another one. This time she elected to dig out the Icy-hot on her own and use half a tube on her legs. I woke up to her crying that her legs were cold and the acrid stench of menthol. I know that feeling kiddo, I know it too well. (I also put a lock on the cabinet the next morning.)\n\nParenting is great. You never know what is going to happen next. Case in point, my one year old son dropped a floater in the tub during bath time tonight. A big, brown, logjam of a turd. Of course my daughter was In the tub too. I hope she's young enough to not remember that experience. Unfortunately I don't think I'll have the same luck.\n\nPray for me y'all, it feels like one of those days.\n\nRobot.\n\nNote: please don't take my attempt at humor as an attack on Chiseled Face or Cryogen. It's a great soap. I mostly use it as an additive while bowl lathering to give a menthol punch to other soaps. However on the days that I really need a wake up call, I reach for it undiluted. It's like deathwish coffee to my face. A hard slap to shake the sleep from my eyes.",

Tried bowl lathering and ended up over watering. I definitely needed more soap. My fault, not the soap.\n\n​\n\nSantal Auster is what I imagine a freshly cut piece of sandalwood would smell like. The scent hasn't changed much since I first sprayed it on, and it shows no signs of weakening. Excellent longevity so far.\n\n​\n\nRevocation is a very underrated and talented band. This was the first song I heard from them and had me listening multiple times just to figure out what was going on. Revocation blends death metal/power metal/fusion/jazz/blues all into the same song.

I found the puck very easy to load and dial in. Cushion was great and slickness was top notch, especially between passes. Aroma is definitely on the weak side but the splash really helped compensate for that. I smell great!\n\nMy bowl already had a sample pressed in so I loaded with the puck in my hand. I was impressed with how the lather exploded and dialed into an acceptable paste with ease.\n\nI don't have much experience face lathering so I found this to be a bit more difficult to find the sweet spot on. I painted the proto-lather pretty thick and evenly before beginning to dip the bristle tips and brush some water into it. I waited until I began to see a bit through the lather before swirling the brush and trying to build it up. This is where I thought I was in trouble - my brush loves soaking up lather so I felt it was pulling a lot of it off me. I realized my mistake was mashing the brush too hard onto my face and swirled with less pressure. In no time the lather was where I wanted in terms of distribution and volume, and I had a dope shave.",

The Platinum and this razor worked so well together for me. One of the few where I honestly could not feel the blade. But it still gave me a great, close cut.\n\nNo tugging or irritation. At. All.\n\n#### ❧ Soap Notes\n*^(Storybook Soapworks - Foret de Liguest)*\n\nA very good base, and a scent I didn't appreciate the first time I tried it. Now I really do, and this guy is a keeper.\n\n1/4+ tsp soap + lightly-wet small badger brush + 4 tsp water = 6 passes of really nice, balanced lather.\n\nScent: you know, that undergrowth stuff. a bit dank and woody. I wish I knew how cypress smelled. Close to this, I would think.\n\nScent Strength: 5-6/10, nicely present during shaving.\n\nBowl - I used the XL version of this bowl:\nhttps://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3392930\n\n\n#### ❧ Brush Notes\n*^(Virginia Cheng - Silvertip Badger 20mm ‹1 uses›)*\n\nMy first shave with this one! A DIY project I put together because the existing VS silvertip I had was too large and I had an old school style barber type handle that I had bored out to be able to re-knot. This is one of those cases where it sat around with me looking at it for a while, waiting for me to get time to dremel the old knot out, then for the knot to come from china, then finally the last day or two to wait for the silicone to dry. It's really nice to see the parts really come together instead of sitting around in limbo land.\n\nThis 20mm knot looked too small at first, but bloomed out nicely during the shave to a great size. And this one's inexpensive, too.\n\nWhile it is floppy, I found it delightful. soft as a cloud, but handled the lather in all the right ways.\n\n#### ❧ Shave Quality\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Smooth\n*Neck*: Smooth\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Cut flush to where I just see the tips (above average for me)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm)\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

It's soft with just the slightest hint of scrub. The backbone is on the lower end of the spectrum.\n\n**Soap:** Bloomed the soap and did full on Marco Method. Both of those did great. Sure, you lose some \"lather\" when loading, but does it make for a really quick face lather. Don't have to put too much work into building it up.\n\n**Scent:** Much like /u/Dganjo said I can see Lamplight Penance becoming the default for Vide Poche. While I have not looked at *Guerlain Jicky* It might be something that I should look into picking up.\n\nHave a nice Tuesday everyone!",

I have to say, I am very impressed. The machining is spot on and the finish is near perfect. When it arrived it had what I thought was a water spot. I hit it with a toothbrush but I think its more of the patina starting.\n\nAs for the shave, one of the closest I've ever had but there was some tugging but i have no irritation or redness. It wasn't simply wiping away whiskers. I'm sure that it's the blade choice/angle of attack. Again, first shave got to figure out the nuances of the razor.\n\nTo sum up... It's a VERY good razor I'll try to take a SOTD pic if I can remember at 5am.",

SBS provides for a smooth shave without too much fuss. Post shave feel is good with no dry skin feel.\n\nAstra SP blade seems to still be going strong but I think I've reached a point where I should change the blade anyway. Just got Voshkod, Big Ben and Gillette Nacetts in the mail - which one should I try first?\n\nBest thing about today's shave was timing - I was able to get a nick-free, smooth shave in little less than 20mins. Including lathering properly, this is pretty great for a morning shave. I used to reserve shaving for the evening/night to take my time - now the practice is paying off!\n\nHave a good Tuesday folks.",

Still waiting on blades. Tried a Shark razor from a sampler and threw it away right after the shave. Soap was slick but the blade didn't feel comfortable at all.\n\nTeacher's Pet is APPLE! Actually a sexy man apple. There's some sweet and musk to back it up and patchouli holding everything together. But apple for days. I like apple so good times. Scent is strong both off the puck and throughout the shave. The soap can take a beating. I added a lot of water just to see what it could do and it held up well. This is a very nice soap. I'm looking forward to the Honor Roll base on the third.\n\nThe theory portion of my Cosmo class is only eight weeks and my final was last night. I'll get an A in the class and very pleased with that. I'm also looking forward to Mondays off for the rest of the semester.\n\nHave a great day guys.",

      "body": "Tuesday 3/19 SOTD\n\n* Razor: Colonial General SS AC\n* Blade: Feather Pro AC (5)\n* Brush: Elite Manchurian bulb 26mm in jasper stone handle\n* Soap: Crown King Porthos\n* Post: Aqua Velva 5 in 1 Sensitive balm\n* Frag: Lauder Aramis EDT\n\nProduct Notes:\n\n* **Soap**: A good soap from a bad man. Porthos is one of the few \"our version of X\" scents I have in my roster, and this one is there because it's based on vintage Aramis (80s era), a scent which has changed a lot over time. The modern version of the scent is still excellent, but the 80s version was wilder and stranger, and SmytHodges nailed the difference admirably in his scent design here. The soap is more musky and animalic than the modern EDT, with more prominent castoreum and the soap also has more of a cumin and musk scent.\n* The CK base is an excellent performer for me. It can more or less match Eufros and WK vegan bases, and is much cheaper per ounce than either. The protection and post shave is exceptionally good here. Not quite as good as the best tallow, but still damn fine. Proof that the Dark Lord has some talent in chemistry to match his talent in scent design. As for Ethics, well, I guess he cut those classes a lot in Shave Artisan Academy. But this is a great scent in a fine base.\n* **Brush:** The occasional dysfunctional Elite bulb, at least when used to face lather, was at his best today, and gave a very efficient and more than adequate amount of product for the shave,\n* **Frag:** The new Aramis is spicier and woodsier than the 80s vintage referenced in the soap of the day. Aramis from the 80s was like Mid-Atlantic wetlands in a bottle; modern Aramis is like the Southwest desert in a bottle. Still utterly worth a try, but different! Great longevity and projection as well, and quite reasonably priced.",

Currently trying to kill this soap sample but those Stirling samples last a while, especially since I don't use it everyday . The Stirling base is still great, it sets the standard for me.\nAboutthe song : The new Aldous Harding single is less intense than her previous works but she's still a great & softly crazy singer I'm fond of ! Pretty impatient to get the full album at the end of april.\nHave a good day !",

As with the Grapefruit, the scent off the soap was strong while the aftershave was a bit more muted. It's a very nice sandalwood scent. In retrospect, I wish I had taken the time to smell this and Proraso Red side by side. I was a regular Proraso user before being introduced to artisan soaps and I always enjoyed the scent on Proraso Red, which is primarily sandalwood, but not quite the same sandalwood as SW Sandalwood. At any rate, the SW Sandalwood paired very nicely with CL Santal Auster.",

This one has soft tips with moderately strong backbone, and just a tiny bit of scrub. It's enough to let me know it's there, but not enough to give me brush burn.",

Apparently it derives from Black Afgano but I haven't smelled that fragrance. In any case I get a mildly sweet slightly dark and deep resinous scent.\n\nThe Karve B plate OC is smooth and efficient as usual, especially nice to use it with a fresh blade. I've determined I can use a blade 2-3 times before tossing. Don't see a need to go beyond that, especially with cheap blades like Astras. Picked up 100 polsilvers about a year ago for $10, so not worth it to push the shave count on blades for me.\n\nHappy Tuesday!\n",

I could definitely keep going with the blade, but it's not quite as smooth as I like so I'll switch it up. APR coming in with another great scent. Off the tub it was surprisingly \"cologne\" like, with a tinge of sharp burnt wood. Upon lathering, more of the rest of the woody scents come to play with a hint of some of the fruitier notes. The Aftershave starts with a splash of the burnt wood but moves quickly to the fruit, patchouli and leather and hints at the musk base.\n\nLamplight Penance is polarizing to say the least. The initial bombardment of lamp oil is a shock to the system, and take a while to tame itself. After an hour or so, the daffodil and peach come forward with a solid base of wood and leather. I do like the fragrance so far, but it's not an instant by for me like some of the other Chatillon Lux has been.\n\nI thought this song was apt due to the reaction from my first use of LLP. Obsolete was the first album I purchased and Shock was always my favorite track.",

The first was back on Saturday, I asked on the simple questions thread, looking for a clean lemon scented soap. I got a lot of advice including Tallow + Steel *\"Sicily\"*, Eleven *\"Sicilian Lemon\"*, DG *\"Sweet Lemon\"* and a few others. I am still interested in trying Sweet Lemon, but one that I forgot I already had was B&M 42, as recommended by [/u/vigilantesd](https://www.reddit.com/user/vigilantesd). The second reason why I chose to shave with 42 today was the announcement from [/u/bostonphototourist](https://www.reddit.com/u/bostonphototourist) that 42 would be making another appearance this year in the Excelsior base.\n\n​\n\nThe scent notes from Try that Soap are Petunia, Ambergris, (a little nod towards the Infinite Improbability Drive) Tea and \"Pan-Galactic Gargle Blaster (sugary lemon). Today marks the second time I have shaved with 42 in the past week. The other day was the 17th and that shave reminded me how much I liked it. Its very lemon forward the first half our or so, then you get this sea air and petunia scent as the lemon fades off but still remains in the background. It's really, really good and I liked it even more on the second day then I did on the first.\n\n​\n\nLather was good. No complaints and I actually had to shave while being muted for a conference call. I only elected for two passes because I was having to stop, unmute my phone, make a comment and then mute it again. I'm looking to see how 42 feels in the Excelsior base. I finished up the shave with my set of 42 AS. I really dig the salty lemon, floral goodness of 42 and I appreciate how the splash extends it. I'll probably pick up the EdT for that reason alone. Also, before I left for work tonight I got my set of Beaudelaire as well as some Micky Lee \"13\". I love a good fougère and it is probably my most common type of soap that I own. I'm looking forward to trying Beaudelaire and the Excelsior base soon.\n\n​\n\nHave a good Wednesday!",

I've fallen for a number of scents in Glissant, but stopped being able to justify picking up the limited releases or seasonals.\n\nAfter trying the new Excelsior finally {skipping Vespers because I don't want Xmas stank on my face regardless of anything [I tried the AS, and I thought it was a fine scent, but I'm a wicked Grinch (yes, I worked a Dr. Seuss joke in there, because we're from the same area)]}, I'm so ready to buy anything B&M puts out in this base. I remember seeing some comments about how the new base was oh so great, but I thought to myself, \"I survived moving from CD to MP3, but I don't know if this base upgrade is worth a damn.\" **Boy, was I wrong.** For the record, I'll be picking up both Diamond and 42 completely blind, because this soap base rocks. And let's not forget the awesome price-point.\n\n\n\n**The Song:** Such a great singer. He's like indie Chris Cornell: so many grace notes and embellishments in his melodies, it's like they're just falling out of his mouth. Strong guitar sound, great rhythm section sound. Very nuanced production. Great lyrics too.\n\n\nGreat shaves all.",

It seems to have gotten a lot of attention lately, and I wanted to try it for myself. I like giving new companies I try so I can form my own opinions. The scent on the soap is another take on Aventus. It is fruitier then some other versions I've used, including Sellout. The scent strength is quite light.\n\nThe soap, at least from the sample packet, was very soft, and it appeared to take a fair amount of water. I had no trouble generating a very glossy, smooth and dense lather. Probably the slickness of the soap is what I would say is it's best characteristic. I had a very smooth shave without any issues.\n\nOverall, I would agree this is a very good soap. I really can't think of any areas that I would say are lacking. If I had to make a minor criticism I would say that the only area I would want improved is that I personally prefer a fattier feeling soap, and I didn't feel like the soap left a fatty layer after I rinsed. That's purely personal preference, however, and some people like soaps that seem to rinse cleaner. That is a very minor criticism, and it really did not bother me at all in the context of an otherwise great shave.\n\nOverall, this soap gave a positive impression, and I think it is a worthy addition to what is currently being offered by wetshaving artisans.",

So when Biblio dropped decided to add the parfum to the order. First time using it, and I only sprayed it about 20 minutes ago. First impression is sharp, and woody, not exactly like the aftershave. I am hoping it will mellow out as the day goes on. Not quite sure if this one will be a keeper.\n\nHave a nice Wednesday everyone!",

Specifically, I wanted to revisit the Feather with a lather I knew. I also wanted to test out the scent on the Melange again.\n\n#### ❧ Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Karve - Christopher Bradley A Plate ::: Feather ‹30 uses›)*\n\nI think the Feather is telling me he doesn't like some mild settings/razors now, at 30 uses. We'll put him in something more aggressive next time.\n\nA little tugging, but no irritation. Great close shave.\n\n#### ❧ Soap Notes\n*^(Dr Jon's - Sunday Funday Extravaganza - Melange)*\n\nAnother of the Sunday Funday soaps from DJ. Dry, I picked up more of the sweetness of apple and pineapple, with a touch of the smoky-woody. But in lather form, I get mostly the smoky-woody-and-something-else (that may be floral-ish), that is also very lightly seasoned by the aforementioned fruit notes. I'm afraid in the actual use, that floral whatever-it-is is just too dominant, while the apple and pineapple and woodiness sit on the sidelines. I'm going to have to pass this one on.\n\n25 second load with lightly-wet brush + 2 tsp water = 4-5 passes of creamy lather, delivering luxurious feel during the rinses. It was a little dry, needing a bit more water. Razor had wonderful glide, and the alc splash at end revealed no sting at all.\n\nScent Strength: 6/10, present during shaving. Some of DJ's recent SF soaps were too lightly scented for me.

Takes about an average amount of effort to whip up a good lather and it's sort of medium-fluffy when it's finished: not thin like B&M stuff, not quite as voluminous as whipped cream. At no point does it make me go \"this must be some shitty glycerin soap without tallow.\" Post-shave feel is about average or slightly higher: no complaints, no glowing praise.\n\nThe scent? '95 Liquid Labels is inspired by Tommy by Tommy Hilfiger. Citrus top notes, apple in the heart, and cotton flower underneath. The citrus is mild though and was gone by the time I was finished shaving, leaving only apple and cotton (which honestly brought Aventus to mind for me, due to the apple connection). The fragrance is practically gone by the time your face is rinsed and after-shave balm is applied, leaving you ready for whatever cologne you want to use without any interference from your soap.\n\nAnother practically perfect shave from the Shark / Tech combo. Shark Tech. I like that. Miles better than the Shark / Super Speed combo on Monday. I'll be curious to see how long this blade lasts now. Can it make it to 10 shaves? Past 10 shaves? We'll see.",

Picked up this soap and sniffed it and it smelled like a sugary sweet thing. Once lathered though, turned into a whole new animal. First thing that hit me was the rose in it, and i kept getting a spice accord (and feeling the burn from it) with it i could not put my finger on at the time. Now though I realize it was the cardamon. Base is fantastic...I'd put it just under Southern Witchcrafts in terms of performance. Makes me anxious to try the other ones I got sent!",

Great blade feel, the efficiency is out of this world and it's very smooth. If I were to compare it to my Karve OC or SB with C plate, the shaving experience is completely different. The CG is more efficient and has more blade feel and sound feedback while the Karve feels safer to use because you don't feel the blade as much.\n\nThe Leonidam Atlantis is such a wonderful brush. Face lathering with it is like massaging your face with a piece of wet cloud in a very sunny day.\n\nI was rewarded today with my closest shave yet.",

However I feel I get a little less thickness. In this regard I compare it to the Glissant base in its structure. Its slickness doesn't have any comparisons.\n\nIt doesn't require a ton of water like other super fatted soaps which makes it fairly easy to dial in. This is an important consideration because with some of the more pasty loading/marshmallowy loading lathers, I think beginners or people new to those bases might struggle to get them to behave.\n\nAll in all I've found this base to be awesome.\n\nI'm not sure I've paid enough attention to aftershave performance to give a proper opinion on Deltus. But I can't deny the results of using the base and the AS together, my face feels luxuriously moisturized for the day. I've noticed that later in the day this effect lingers.",

The General is milder but heavier, and I find AC blades do best with less weight behind them. The ATT is a quicker more aggressive shaver that is less likely to irritate or cut, but the Colonial is smoother in feel. Both are great shaves, so I usually move the AC over to the aluminum ATT after 5 uses so as to minimize any rust concerns.\n* Brush: The Jeffy always feels like it costs a lot, so the price is not really an issue. Knot has lost 5 or 6 hairs over close to two years and has a few horizontal stragglers, but looks great and performs wonderfully. I occasionally wonder what other Declaration batches might be like, but, as with marriage, the costs of varied experimentation are definitely prohibitive and the potential upside purely speculative.\n* Soap: Scent here is much stronger and hence better than the splash. A pleasant mellow understated soap, much different from the usual B&M sturm und drang. (Which I like, BTW...)",

It was my travel set-up for those days and it was not the most enjoyable shaves, let's say. I kinda did it just because I needed to shave and working with the canned goo was less optimal. Traditional Three Pass shave. The best thing about this set-up was that I did not get a lot of irritation or nicks.\n\n**The Soap** did its job but nothing spectacular. I used the Palmolive Stick for one day and it was harder to lather up than the usual. It's probably because I loaded it for 30 + Seconds and I had to dial water for over 5 minutes. And it was still too dry. As for the Gillette Canned Goo, it worked up a fast lather. However, it provided very little slickness and little protection. I could barely shave over the lather and I had to reapply every time. Not optimal but it worked.\n\n**The Razor and Blade** combination worked well surprisingly. Maybe I developed my own technique but it was surprisingly easier than the last time. It has been about 4 months since I used this razor and it was not the best. This time, it was quite enjoyable despite the sub-optimal lather. Nice shave without a lot of nicks or cuts.\n\n**The Brush** worked okay. It is one of the hardest brushes to use because it is so small and small loft makes it rougher to use. It worked but it has a bit too much scrub for my taste. When I try to paint it, it does not do a good job because it is so small. It works for travel but I do need to break it in even more.\n\n**The aftershave portion** was great. The Aloe does burn my skin a tiny bit and it's probably because it has alcohol. Regardless, my skin was well moisturized and a bit oily because of the Nivea Creme. Overall, it did protected my skin and I was satisfied with the combo.\n\nOverall, it was okay shaves. I would definitely not use the Canned Goo nor the tiny brush but during a travel, I do not have much choice. I could dispose these products over a travel but I would not dispose my other essentials. That said, I shaved and it worked. During the next travel days, I'll probably stick with these items again because they work fast. I'll enjoy the rest of my wet shaving gears at home.",

Turns out it was just over 2 weeks of daily shaves. I realize that's nowhere near the record on this sub but still impressive IMO. I knew Polsilvers were highly regarded but didn't have too much experience w/ them prior to this. Even at 25-30 cents a blade, this is quite a bargain. I'm now realizing my current stockpile of software and blades will not need to be replenished anytime soon.",

South wind 5 to 10 mph. High tide at 12:10 this afternoon.\n\n**Brush:** Back to the boar today for the theme. While this brush isn't my favorite, it is my favorite boar. Backbone is just about where I like it. It's scrubby but not overly so, and the scritch factor has dropped immensely since I first started using it. Over all I will be keeping this brush, but it might not see much use.\n\n**Soap:** Tradition. First full day of Spring is when Adagio comes out. This set was my first Barrister and Mann purchase and was the start of a beautiful love affair with shaving. This was the tip of the iceberg in regards to finding what scents I liked and didn't like. This was the first soap that when I lathered it up, and had the wife come to smell it she stole the brush so she could huff the scent. Also the first soap in my experience to have menthol in the soap as well as the splash, which is why this soap gets relegated to use during the warmer months. Over all a great performer and scent.\n\n**Frag:** While I wish Adagio had a matching EdC I find that L'Eau D'Issey pairs with it fine. I am almost out of my decant from when Frag Fridays were still going on. I will have to pick up a full bottle as it just hits all the right notes for me.\n\nHave a nice Thursday everyone!",

Splendid shave with the SE1 today. Been awhile since I shaved with something this sharp. The Feather Pro Super is the sharpest AC that I've tried and went right through a few bumps that my DE has missed the last few days. BBS still 10 hours later now, gotta be a record for me.\n\nThe Seville EdT smells exactly like the soap and aftershave. I applied my usual two sprays to my chest which was enough for the first hour. The scent started to fade after that and there wasn't much left at hour 4. I suppose that's not completely unheard of for EdT strength, but it makes it the worst performing in my collection. I will try more sprays next time and see how it performs.\n\nJust purchased tickets for Devin Townsend with Dance With the Dead and Avatar in May. Be my first show in at least a year, must be getting old. This is the best live performance every recorded, hands down. Enjoy!\n\n​",

I haven't shaved in a week since I was off all of last week and just didn't feel like doing it. So, needless to say, I had quite a lot to take off. This was my first use of an Astra since I took up wetshaving and the experience was night and day different from the first time. It was buttery smooth in the R41, even with 7 days growth.\n\nI know it's technically now Spring, but it's been cold and rainy here so I felt Hallows was appropriate. Pairing it with La Fougere Parfaite was really something special. Those two play really well together.\n\nTo those of you in the r/wetshaving NCAA bracket challenge: Good Luck! I can't wait to lose to all of you.\n\nP.S. Keep an eye on Grant Williams and Tennessee in the tournament and thank me later.",

Between picking up an extra shift at work and coming down with a 24 hour bug I haven't gotten the chance to take any photos over the last few days. I've been doing a little trading on the shave bazaar though. Thanks to [/u/giganticsteps](https://www.reddit.com/u/giganticsteps) I was able to make a trade for some DG Sweet Lemon. I also traded for some Phoenix and Beau Whitechapel. I'm pretty excited about Whitechapel. The scent notes of smoke, leather, vetiver and sandalwood sound amazing, but honestly? I'm a [sucker for the art](https://i.imgur.com/z13roy2.jpg) (credit to /u/120inna55 for the photo from his first impressions post).\n\n​\n\nSpeaking of art, I was thinking about art and label design. Last month /u/La_Yerba_Mate did an AMA and one of his top comments was *\"I completely understand that as a small artisan you may not have the means to hire a graphic designer. To save costs, they make the designs themselves. The issues occurs when instead of keeping their designs simple, they try to imitate popular designs and they fall short. Instead of a having a fully serviceable label that they are capable of designing, they now have a poor looking design that is doing them no favors.*\n\n***Instead of finding a cohesive look, too many brands focus on the individual label. It may lead to a good looking label, but it does nothing to help brand awareness.*** *As far as seeing the whole picture,* *my biggest peeve is when an artisan picks a scent name that doesn't fit the label*. *May seem like a dumb thing, but all parts have to work together.\"*\n\n​\n\nAs someone who appreciates good design aesthetic, the part in bold stuck with me. Case in point, Noble Otter. Today I shaved with Flying Hide. I got a sample of this from Maggards earlier this week. This is an awesome scent. It smells like walking into a western wear store. The lather and slickness are fantastic too. Seeing as how the owner /u/NobleOtter is from Houston, I could almost imagine him basing the scent on a Cavender's Boot City (an iconic western wear chain located across Texas). I would argue that Noble Otter represents one of the finest unified design aesthetics in the Wetshaving community. One only need look at each of the labels with an inner and outer circle and the centrally located otter. Each design is different, but their is an unified theme as a whole that is distinct to the Noble Otter brand.\n\n​\n\nI don't know how often people think about good design aesthetic, but it does matter. When Brad /u/undream22 was doing his AMA 11 days ago, on the topic of how he selects his products for sale he wrote: *\"Packaging. It's becoming more important. stealing photos off a google image search, Clipart, and Office '97 \"word art\" fonts are no longer an option in this market.* ***If your stuff ain't beautiful, it ain't gonna sell***. *Also, we want to know that packing isn't going to change. Crazy enough, in this market, people will literally not buy a soap if it's been re-released with a new label. Old labels = dead product.\"*\n\n​\n\nI think we in the wetshaving community want to believe that the quality of the lather and the scent of the soap makes the most difference (and it should). But I can't deny that some soaps seem to garner more attention then others. Think about Declaration Grooming with their collaboration with Chatillon Lux, Mammoth Soaps or Chiseled Face with the Zoologist line. All of the product lines I have mentioned are distinctive while still maintaining a unified whole. They photograph well and are easily recognizable.\n\n​\n\n**TL;DR** Label design aesthetic matters.\n\n​\n\nRobot.",

Makes it hard to dial in your baseline shave, so to speak. Last two shaves haven't been great, and it's harder for me isolate the reason why as a result.\n\nFor starters, I typically shave every other day. The right side of my neck is still looking/feeling quite angry from my last two shaves, which came on back to back days.\n\nTrying a new blade brand, having my first try at a synthetic brush, and face lathering for only the second time ever yielded less than stellar results.\n\nI rushed my load and only had enough for two quality passes. I also needed to spend more time working the lather on my face and feeding it more water before I began my first pass. It was a lot dryer and thicker than I'm accustomed to compared to my bowl lathers. Lastly, I was thrown for a loop with the amount of backbone this brush had compared to my much floppier Parker silvertip.\n\nI've used Feather blades almost exclusively, and was excited to try the PolSilvers. Sharpness is no issue for me, but I found them to be notably rough on my skin. I didn't take my time though and I'd expect it has as much to technique and timing as anything\n\nPretty uneven results - lots of feedback from the alum, and I missed some stubble here and there.\n\nThat said, I've grown to adore Beaudelaire's scent after being lukewarm on it initially. The soap base did all it could to protect me from a shave I should have taken more time with. The aftershave has left my skin feeling nourished and satin-smooth - between this and the excelsior base, I'd say I'm actually more excited for new releases of B&M's Deltus splashes.\n\nTomorrow is another day, lads.",

My normal driver was the SB D plate, so the comparison will be to that.\n\n\nThe soap: Used the same soap as yesterday so I could compare apples to apples. Good slick lather face lathering using the Marco method and I was ready to go.\n\n\nThe hardware: Same brush, blade, handle, and top cap as yesterday's shave. Only the open comb base plate was new. I decided to start with the C since the Karve website stated that the open comb from one step less aggressive with perform similar to the next step up SB plate (The C OC plate should perform like the D SB plate).\n\nI hadn't realized how much patina my Karve had developed until the shiny new baseplate was installed. Nothing mind blowing, but given that I have only had the Karve a few months, I'm impressed.\n\n\nThe shave: Honestly, this was one of the most efficient shaves I have had in a long time. After a WTG and XTG passes, I have achieved a DFS. I decided not to push for the 3rd pass since my youngest was up last night for over an hour with a night terror (those are no joke) and I want to be on my game for a 3 pass shave with the OC.\n\nThe C OC felt about as aggressive as the D SB plate, but much more efficient. I had more blade feel with the OC, but not in a bad way. I paid slightly more attention to my angles and was more than fine. No blood sprayed on the mirror, no weepers, and less irritation than normal for my skin. I would call this OC a keeper and it'll probably become my daily driver.\n\n\nThe verdict: OC is a great choice if you want efficiency and a great shave. IMHO, better than the SB plates. I would love to get my mitts on a OC D plate to give it a spin and do another comparison.\n\nedit: pre-coffee mobile posting spelling corrections",

This tin has the ring of death so it will be gone soon. My lone boar brush performed admirably well for the theme today, but I was kinda looking forward to giving my new SHD knot it's maiden voyage. Ah well, there's always tomorrow. Happy Thursday shavers!",

I was very hyped to get this one from what everyone has said. I enjoyed the scent, id call it a powder fougere, but honestly wasnt my top scent. Definitely enjoyable, and I think it will be one of those scents that grows on me over time.\n\nThis was also my first time with Excelsior. This things take water like nothing I've seen. It's actually incredible. Also, someone had mentioned that the lather just seemed soft, and id have to agree. It's a different consistency, like a dense cloud, and I really like it. I'm gonna need a little more time to dial in this base, but it worked well for me\n\nI also realized how important witch hazel is for my skin. I was going to not use an AS for science, but then my skin got super tight (happens very easily and with pretty much every soap). After about 20 minutes, I put on some Thayers and I was instantly moisturizerized and soft. Does this happen to anyone else?\n\nOne more day till Friday",

Not sure if that's due to the blade or improving technique so I'm looking forward to going through them a second time. I've stopped trying to go ATG on my neck and my face has thanked me for that. Still getting a pretty decent shave but with no irritation which has been nice.\n\nTaking a little extra time building my lather has really paid off as well. Definitely wasn't adding enough water when I started but I'm slowly getting the hang of it.",

Visiting the Long Black Beauty and seeing how it handles the aging Feather. And trying out a new-to-me synthetic: Timberwolf.\n\n#### ❧ Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Gillette - Black Beauty Long Setting 5 ::: Feather ‹31 uses›)*\n\nA pretty good match. wasn't smooth, but was comfortable. Still giving great shaves as we move into the 4th decade of use.\n\nNo tugging or irritation.\n\n#### ❧ Soap Notes\n*^(Henri et Victoria - Terre d'Henri - Vegan)*\n\nI enjoy this vegan base of HeV.\n\n50 second load with lightly-wet synth brush + 5 tsp water = 6 passes of slick, somewhat creamy lather.\n\nScent: woody (not pine, maybe oak-ey) with some gentle supporting notes is what I got. I liked it.\n\nScent Strength: 4/10, lightly present during shaving. Sure, I wish it was stronger, but is okay.\n\nBowl - I used the XL version of this bowl:\nhttps://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3392930\n\n\n#### ❧ Brush Notes\n*^(That Darn Rob - Timberwolf 26mm Blk & Wht ‹1 uses›)*\n\nI didn't expect to like this knot. I dislike most synths. I did feel some softness in the backbone with this one, that I didn't feel with the tuxedo. And I wondered if it could be different. But I didn't think it would be enough.\n\nBut it turned out not to push my face around very much at all. It was definitely workable. And of course the soft tips were very nice.\n\n#### ❧ Shave Quality\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Cut flush to where I just see the tips (above average for me)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm)\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

Lathering took longer than any other soap I've tried so far but I did start with a relatively drier brush. I kept adding water to get an okay lather but I didn't really have sufficient lather for 3 passes. I'm going to chalk this one up to \"user in-experience/error\".\n\nBoar brush scrub felt great last night. I'm glad theme Thursday forced me to use it. Not as easy to lather up but feels good on the skin when face lathering.\n\nI regretted switching to the R3 plate for this shave - went down a plate because of the new blade that is known for being very sharp. Didn't end up with as close a shave.\n\nThe scent of BTW! is really nice. A bit too sweet for an office environment IMO but my gf loved it! This one has taken over DG Sweet Lemon as her favourite scent. I enjoyed the scent a lot too and while it was quite sweet, I didn't find it nauseating.\n\nGood March Madness Thursday folks!",

The combo has got a full spectrum of notes.\n\nThe brush here is a Maseto, I think you have to acquire them on eBay, but it's sort of an OG affordable high density knot that has really soft tips and tremendous backbone. I don't see many people using them here. Solid choose and cool small selection of handle types.\n\nGreat shave.\n",

PIF'd the SOC last year, which was the last of em to go, and do not regret my unboared status.\n\n​\n\n* Razor: ATT Calypso SE\n* Blade: AC Feather Pro (7)\n* Brush: Simpson Chubby 2 Best 27mm\n* Soap: Eufros Lima Espices tallow\n* Post: Beardbrand Lumber Yard balm\n* Frag: Caron Yatagan EDT\n\nProduct Notes:\n\n* **Soap**: Moderate level menthol makes the post shave feel amazing (skin is a tad numb), the scent is gorgeous (lime and spices), and the performance is first tier. There have been emperors in history who have had worse shaves than this one... (Actually probably most emperors; besides the general lack of chemistry know-how, the steel used for shaving in past imperial ages has also been of poor quality.)\n* **Post:** Bought this at Tarjay by mistake - thought it was AS balm, but is actually beard and face moisturizer. Reading is indeed fundamental! But in any case, this stuff is fun to use - comes out of the jar like beaded sand and melts as warmed on face and hands. Plus it smells like cedar and other woods. For all intents and purposes, it feels and smells like one is rubbing sawdust on one's face.\n* Performance of the balm is also great, a fine moisturizer, but maybe a tad thick and tacky, so needs extended rub in to avoid greasy face. Still, a fine change of pace!\n* **Frag:** utterly weird ass mix of galbanum and artemisia, overlying complex herbal spices and incense, ends up smelling like vegetative grassy musk, or maybe ritualistic celery. Call it a really upscale Pinaud Veg, but with a ton more complexity and elegance, and less of a floral presence.\n\n​",

Super stoked based on all of the great feedback. This zenith is getting comfy after a number of uses. Seems to break in more easily than other boars, but I'm not a huge fan of the handle.

The first thing I noticed was that it was heavier than I thought it would be, which I was excited about. This is my first open comb so I wasn't 100% sure what to expect other than the comments I had read from others. It turned out to be a great shave, definitely milder than I had expected. There was more blade feel than with a safety bar, but it was super smooth. It was also very efficient. I can say that I am very pleased! I may try a C plate OC as well someday.\n\nI can also report that the Ghost Town Barber pairs very well with the Biblio fragrance.",

      "body": "Last night's shave, but I did look up the theme ahead of time so happily participating \"today.\"\n\n**Brush:** Omega Boar 80266\n\n**Razor:** Gillette Tech\n\n**Blade:** Derby Extra (1)\n\n**Lather:** Southern Witchcrafts Tres Matres\n\n**Post Shave:** Witch Hazel\n\nFirst of all special thanks to /u/Phteven_j for the soap courtesy of his awesome PIF! This is my first floral scented soap so forgive me if my scent notes/description is horribly off. [I'd refer you to Ruds review if you want a proper description of the scent and performance.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/ayqezs/review_southern_witchcrafts_tres_matres/)\n\nI had a couple of good shaves in a row thanks to a Vokshod blade, but didn't have a chance to post about them earlier in the week. So my face was feeling good coming into this shave and I was hoping to keep it that way. I saw the theme for today and figured that I've been meaning to use my trusty Omega boar again for a bit so I made sure to give it a good soak before my shave.\n\nLathered up my soap and got to work. The shave was pretty average. No major cuts or other issues, but the Derby definitely wasn't as smooth as I remembered. Although, I haven't tried a Derby in the Gillette Tech before so maybe it just isn't as good of a combo as it is with the EJ. Either way, the Vokshod blade I was using previously seemed to tug less and give a better shave on some of my stubborn neck hairs. Might be ordering a bunch of those soon.\n\nAs far as my thoughts on the soap - the smell reminded me of a wedding bouquet; almost like I rummaged through my wifes products to find something to shave with, but I wouldn't necessarily call it feminine. Attempting to pull any specifics out of the scent, all I could really put my finger on was calla lily which is likely why it smells like a wedding bouquet to me. The scent is billed as a \"floral petrichor\" and after looking up the word petrichor I'd say it fits the bill. It was definitely more floral on the puck, but as I lathered the soap up on my face, the floral scent was really balanced by the earthy dankness. As a quick aside, I'm not sure this is what I'd define a petrichor scent as just because I'm not used to this floral of a scent after a rainfall. It really made me feel like I was lost in a greenhouse or something rather than a classic rain scent if that makes sense.\n\nPerformance wise - the soap loaded easily into a luxurious lather for me at first, but I did seem to have an issue for my second pass. I'm not sure if I didn't load the soap enough the first time or it just needed some water to puff back up, but it seemed like almost all of my lather disappeared between my first and second passes. I loaded a little more soap up and the next thing I know I had way too much lather so perhaps it was not loading enough the first time around, perhaps my boar brush sucked up way more lather than I remembered, or something else. Something to work on next though as I'm sure it's not the soaps fault.\n\nWhisky Wednesday pairing - Lagavulin 8 year Limited Edition. For an 8 yo, this scotch isn't as harsh as I'd normally expect and it's also got this strange buttery smoothness that I can't quite explain. Scotch paired really well with this soap as I was having a hard time differentiating which lovely, dirty smell was coating my nose after awhile.",

I had imagined it to be made of thinner plastic and as someone who is quite clumsy, worried how it would withstand a drop onto a tiled shower floor, but that is not the case and am happy that it meets my expectations. The Shavebowl fits perfectly in my tiny hands and I didn't have too much trouble holding onto it even with wet soapy hands. Much easier to hold onto compared to my Timeless bowl.\n\nFor my lather, I folded Stirling's Autumn Glory sample-sized soap into half of an empty tub I had hanging around, and another sample-sized Hot Apple Cider in the other half to give it a more spicy scent. I used to have a hard time with this lather, finding it thin and not cushiony enough, but today I spent a bit more time with lathering in the bowl and found it to work out pretty decently.",

A super sweet scent to put you in a holiday mood.\n\nHave a great Friday all!",

I few tiny weepers, but overall a great shave. I'm getting much more comfortable with the razor. The key for me is no pressure and not over shaving.\n\nTres Matres performed wonderfully, easy to lather, scent is terrific. I get mostly the Lavender, Calla Lily and ozone once lathered. Maybe a slight bit of the fruit in there, but I'm sure getting the matching splash would bring out more of the accords as per usual. I will have to spring for a set soon. Nefertiti is a no for me. Not sure which note/notes it is, but it smells like grandma just got home from Bingo and used a car air freshener for deodorant. Just no.\n\nAny Given Day is not the heaviest music, but has some great riffs and catchy hooks. Have really grown on me lately. I could go without the skinny jeans and hipster beards. I have no idea why grown men think skinny jeans are okay or why there mother's let them leave the house with flat brimmed snap back hats. Anyway, great tune.",

I remember at the time I didn't care for it nearly as much as Executive, but overtime my tastes gradually changed and I came to enjoy it more and more.\n\nScent off the puck is juniper, but it's less individual notes and more of cologne scent. Trythatsoap lists notes of juniper, bergamot, jasmine & patchouli as the primary scents. I feel like there are more notes here, but I really can't put my finger on them. It smells more complex than a four note soap normally is. It's very clean, my wife loves it and it's an anytime of the year scent.\n\nSoap loads well and while Stirling base is not usually listed in the top five for soap bases, I started out using them for nearly a year and I have a pretty good handle on how to build a lather. Slickness is moderate as is hydration. I reached for Clubman despite knowing that the alcohol in the Aftershave will dry out my skin because I love the way it compliments the soap. About five mins after I used some lemon moisturizing lotion to help balance everything out.\n\nIn other news I had a mini mail call. /u/BadlanderOneThree helped me out with a sale over on DFS. I didn't have an account set up and he brokered a deal for me to get some Night Music AS. It was really cool of him and I wanted to publicly recognize him for helping me out. I also got a Schick Injector Type G from /u/Fuckchalzone last night and I'll be using it soon.\n\nHave a Good Friday y'all and enjoy the weekend!\n\nRobot",

The soap has, so far, been an excellent performer, producing a rich protective lather with little trouble. Kind of underwhelmed by the Cat O' Nine Tails. After using Clubman VIBR, the post-shave burn was like, \"Is this it?\" Smells great, though.\n\n​",

I don't enjoy the SB version of the plate typically, but the increased efficiency made it much more palatable. There was no reduction in smoothness, however, which was pretty amazing to me. My Fatip is much more bitey, so I guess, just like blade gap, the fact that a razor is open comb does not guarantee more aggression. Looking forward to using the OC D today, as I think it will be the goldilocks plate for me.\n\nHappy Friday!",

Especially because it was raining all day yesterday. I was surprised by how light the scent was. This is the kind of scent you could use for ages and not be bothered by- at least I could. I still find the DG Splashes to be a little challenging. The menthol and alcohol always wake me up. I think this scent would work really well with Shawn's La Foret de Liguest so if the day is just too cold I could always pair that toner with it. In other news I'm psyched for the West Egg drop especially after reading Shawn's scent notes. I have a tub of WK Jamestown Gentlemen that I think it might be excellent for. Happy Friday everybody!",

Smells very similar to TF Oud Wood. Although the scent is really nice, it is pretty strong and \"colognish\" for my taste in soap scents.",

Advertised notes are citrus, ozone; champagne, kelp, sea air; cloves, driftwood, musk. I don't notice *any* of them as distinct notes though because it's all blended and balanced so well. To both me and my buddy, this stuff just smells like really nice hotel soap and we found it to be pretty linear - not much change through the shave or drydown. So it's good, but it's not like, 'Yarrr, I be spendin' the day buryin' treasure at the beach with me hearties\" nautical.\n\nWith elbow grease, this produces some beautiful lather that reminds me a lot of canned shave cream. Thick, voluminous, gloopy, nice peaks... Just beautiful. Felt excellent while hand lathering and I was quite impressed.\n\nNow the bad: The look and feel of the lather outshone its performance on my face. Primary and residual slickness were not as good as the other artisan soaps in my collection, though they were still a step above cheap glycerin soaps like Proraso. Post-shave, my skin was pretty tight and dry, *even after letting my post-shave balm soak in.* I know Andrew @ Siliski said his soaps were developed for sensitive skin (eczema and the likes) so it's probably a good choice for a customer who needs that, but it doesn't come close to making the cut for my own collection.\n\nAnother nice shave from the Shark Tech combo. Starting to fade a bit but it's not across the threshold into unpleasant territory yet.",

Super soft tips, but not near the amount of backbone as B7. I can see where the comparisons to knoots come from but this is still a far cry from the same density. I even drilled the handle a few mm deeper because it splayed too much for me at the original depth. Still an awesome knot and MASSIVE. I would say it pretty much blows my Elite and other similarly priced options out of the water. The SW lather was glorious as usual and I love pairing it with Santal Absolut. I've been using the unscented liniment everyday since I got it because it leaves my face feeling incredible. I'm thinking I should've bought 2 bottles when I had the chance. :/ Happy Friday all and have a great start to the weeekend!",

This is a great performing soap. I swear it's as slick as anything in my den. This barbershop scent is a traditional powdery clean. I've never seen a scent profile listed but I believe it's bergamot, leather, fir, inscence, and patchouli. I'm sure someone can correct me.\n\nThe lather was so good I had to check my razor setting like, is this thing on? Had to crank the dial up a bit. What a great shave. I remember early on when I kept experiencing \"the best shave ever\". Well, I just had another one. I'm fully on board the Murphy & McNiel train. That's good since some St James should be arriving today.\n\nHave a great day fellas.",

The Hoshi Tombo is such a small, nimble, straight, and it takes such a nice edge. It really is a pleasure to shave with. Talbot Incholm was excellent, as always. This was my first use of Maol aftershaves, and the hype is real. Amazing stuff. The scent also paired very nicely with Incholm.",

They just feel very rough and I get a bit of a scratching sensation from them and my skin is red and I got a good nick by my Adam's apple. So needless to say I probably won't be using these anymore. I had to apply an additional post balm to further soothe my skin which I used Nivea cooling post shave balm which helped.

Next time add a little more water.\n\nScent: a nice, sweet lime.\n\nScent Strength: 4-5/10, present during shaving.\n\nBowl - I used the XL version of this bowl:\nhttps://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3392930\n\n\n#### ❧ Brush Notes\n*^(That Darn Rob - Timberwolf 26mm Blk & Wht ‹2 uses›)*\n\nNice, comfy and soft.\n\n#### ❧ Shave Quality\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Few hairs are showing some tip length (with most being cut flush)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm)\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

A&E's base is really really awesome, highly recommend for those who haven't tried it. It's got a lot of super fats in it, so not surprising, but the performance still surprises me.\n\nB&M Excelsior is slicker by a tiny margin. But the volume and thickness of A&E is a notch above. All in all, can't see how this gets any better, but I'm sure it will.\n\nWith all the new releases coming up, my face and my brain need to come to terms with the lightening of my wallet. Maybe there's a compromise there...but not one I'd bet on.\n\nHappy Friday! time to kick up the feet a bit as this week has been absolutely nuts.",

Initial impression is that it's a bit more floppy (higher loft) and not quite as soft in the tips as my Zenith 28mm Chubby Scrubby. Still a very nice brush though and I appreciate the larger handle on this one vs. my Zenith (less likely to get soap on my fingers). I had wanted to add a second boar to my lineup (the Zenith has a very dense knot that takes > 24 hrs to fully dry), and this will definitely work. I know Semogues have a reputation for long break-in period so I'll be patient with it and hopefully it gets even softer with time.",

As usual a fantastic shave with this setup. Last time I used Kyoto, I mentioned not having a matching frag, and pondered a combination of Leau d'Issay and Encre Noir. Well today I went for it, and while it isn't a perfect match, it is absolutely complimentary. Hell yeah!!! It's a little brighter and lacks the seaweed and green tea notes, but the Yuzu and woodiness work well together, and are a perfect combo for the beginning of spring. I'm stoked on the discovery!!!\n\nHope everyone has a great Friday!!!\n=)",

The art on the front is just hilarious, so I'm definitely happy with my purchase. Have a great day, folks!",

Top performance and one of my favorite scents. I think I'm finally getting the hang of lathering with the B7, turns out I just wasn't loading enough soap. It's such a dense not, that I was underloading and thinning it out too easily.\n\nHerod matched very well with Fenchurch. The scent opens with a bit of pepper and cinnamon, quickly followed by a pipe tobacco scent with a slight bit of vanilla. As the scent dries down, I get a touch of wood and musk, but the tobacco is still every present. Longevity is quite good, not over strong but I can still easily smell it 8 hours later.\n\nTool is on the verge of finally completing their next album. It's been over 10 years since 10,000 Days was released, so saying that fans are eagerly awaiting the new album is an understatement. The use of dynamics makes the song sound even heavier than it is and is something Tool does better than anyone else. Cheers!",

Being in the UK, I'd rather try a soap first before paying for shipping (and possible import duties etc) from the US.\n\nThe first one I tried had to be Thé Noir, as I've heard it mentioned on here a lot. It did not disappoint! Great lather and I love the scent. Being British I'm naturally predisposed to the smell of tea, which is probably part of it.\n\nThe net result is I've ordered a full size puck of it from topofthechain. I'm looking forward to working my way through the other samples, but it's quickly going to get very expensive if I like them all as much as Thé Noir!\n\nHave a great weekend all!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Eventide was a seasonal winter release by Barrister and Mann in 2017. Scent notes from try that soap include oud, raspberry, rose and lime. The soap base is Glissant and the lather, cushion and slickness were all excellent.\n\nBefore we go any further though I need to tell you a story. Years ago, when I was in college two of my roommates liked to chew tobacco. My roommates, also had communal spit jar that they kept on the living room table. Over the course of weeks I watch these two guys slowly fill it up with Skoll and Copenhagen remnants. To say that it was absolutely disgusting is putting it mildly.\n\nWhy would this story matter you might ask? Well, to this day I have never forgotten what chewing tobacco smells like. I don't chew tobacco and I never plan to, but nonetheless I am very familiar with ascent. Unfortunately here is the rub. To my nose Eventide smells exactly like chewing tobacco. I like a lot of B&M products. I've raved before about Nocturne and Night Music, but I can't wrap my head around this one.\n\nThis isn't my first time shaving with Eventide. Like several others soaps I own, I tried to give it a chance. Maybe if I had not been exposed to chewing tobacco in such a negative way, I wouldn't have picked up on those sent notes. But I do and it makes it very, very hard to shave with it.\n\nPost shave feel was excellent. It was exactly what I would expect from a B&M Glissant based soap. I'll be trading off Eventide soon and I hope the next person will enjoy it more then I did.\n\nIn other news, I was an irresponsible but awesome parent last night as I let my four year old stay up until 11pm and I introduced her to some clean versions of the Foo Fighters, Toadies, Soundgarden and Nirvana (she liked Everlong btw). I don't know, I just feel like there's so much crap music out there right now. I want her to grow up with a good base in music like I did from my father.\n\nHave a good Saturday Y'all,\n\nRobot",

Cloudy through mid morning, then gradual clearing, with a high near 47. Breezy, with a west wind 15 to 20 mph, with gusts as high as 45 mph. Chance of precipitation is 30%. High tide at 1:52 this afternoon.\n\nNice shave this morning. Marco method provides another great lather. Still not feeling great, hoping it doesn't last long.\n\nHave a nice Saturday everyone!",

Some loading issues, but ended well, giving slick creamy rinses between passes.\n\n#### ❧ Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Gillette - Fat Boy Setting 3 ::: Personna - Vikings Sword ‹1 uses›)*\n\nSo smooth! Great combo and results.\n\nNo tugging or irritation.\n\n#### ❧ Soap Notes\n*^(Soap Smooth - Sandalwood Ten)*\n\nPerformance so good.\n\n60 second load with lightly-wet low-backbone boar brush + 2 tsp water = 3 passes of creamy and slick lather. Probably needed a bit more water.\n\nScent: fairly simple dry woody scent. Is it really sandalwood? I dunno.\n\nScent Strength: 4-5/10, lightly present during shaving.\n\nBowl - I used the XL version of this bowl:\nhttps://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3392930\n\n\n#### ❧ Brush Notes\n*^(Semogue - 2000 Boar ‹3 uses›)*\n\nThe small container of the soap made loading need a little longer than usual. Otherwise this brush continues to be very comfortable and a joy to use.\n\n#### ❧ Shave Quality\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Smooth\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Cut flush to where I just see the tips (above average for me)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm)\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

I was always under the impression that longer growth made for an easier shave and gave my skin a little more time to recover in between shaves. However, since switching to every day, I find that I'm getting better results. With much less growth, each shave requires less passes, there's less irritation after a shave and my skin feels better overall. I think a big part of that is not chasing BBS every time I shave, knowing that if I didn't get an area to my satisfaction, it'll be waiting for me the next day vs. 2-3 days down the line. I guess I'm just surprised. I would have thought that shaving more frequently would have resulted in more irritation, but I've found the opposite to be true. Enjoy your weekend!",

I used my synthetic brush and the Kaboom bottle is just there for some green.** So today was my best shave with the Reserve line yet. It had decent slickness and gave me a very close and comfortable shave. It's not as heavy a post shave feel as DG or WK and maybe a little drying for me so I threw some balm on it. This is the first base I've really had to work at. Maybe with more use I'll get it dialed even more. Maybe April will be Reserve line as my daily driver. Ruds shave score was part of what kept me from throwing in the towel on it, that and Will's scents. I could see a lot of people just moving on potentially. I'm a little more curious about excelsior as a result but I'm full up on bases to learn at the moment. For now the Gillette 7 o'clock Blacks are my blade. Still should probably try Voshods and maybe Gillette Rubies. Have a great Saturday everybody.",

I honestly just think I haven't been loading enough soap. I'm gonna try an even heavier load next time and see. I think I am getting it though. I smell amazing. I have a full set of reserve Seville coming in for next week and I'm super excited. Question for reserve lovers, does this last for a long time since you don't need to load that heavy? I'm thinking it will take a long time to get through a reserve puck\n\nIt's the freaking weekend, hell yeah",

I got a bunch of samples when 3M had the pre release. This scent smells perfect for spring. The best part was when I let the bathroom and then came back and it hit me again. I'm going back for a couple of full tubs and some edt's. The soap lathers super easy and I damn near had a solid lather right in the loading bowl. The vegan stuff isn't quite as slick as the tallow soaps but that could be me? The soap can handle some water and I had a ton of lather. The scent is really really good to me.\n\nI had finally settled on Feather HS blades and ordered a hundred. Then I popped a Personna in and said damn. This blade really works for me too.\n\nHave a great weekend. I'm off to school to cut some hair.",

Bring it back please, B&M!\n\nThe Knack and the Maggard synthetic brush are part of my travel kit, but it's been a while since I've used them so I took them out. I also wanted to try a Permasharp blade (usually I use Lord SS or Voskhod) in it. A few small mishaps here and there, but nothing that drew blood, so a decent shave overall.\n\nHappy Saturday folks!",

Gotta say, it was one of the easiest face lathering I've had. Soaking wet brush, swirled on the puck for about 90 seconds, then straight to the face. Enough soap for 3 or 4 passes easy.\n\nTuscan Leather is another terrific scent from Tom Ford. The initial blast of leather is very earthy with a tinge of suede. The scent transitions to a softer leather being supported by the raspberry and saffron. The dry down adds a little of a woody and amber accord and stays very pleasant. This is a perfect scent to compliment Flying Hide.\n\nWho doesn't need a little Pantera in their day? Rest in Peace brothers' Abbott!\n\n​",

Call it preconceptions, but I always associated it with a feminine scent. Instead, through some samples I found that I really enjoyed Lavender forward soaps and they are a nice break between some of the more heavy soaps and AS I use regularly. Today I used Reserve Lavender from B&M. This tub came from from /u/t[hecarbohydratedone](https://www.reddit.com/user/thecarbohydratedone) off of the shave bazaar. I also tried out my Shick Injector Type G for the first time. I got this razor from /u/Fuckchalzone after asking for advice on one of daily question threads. First impressions are good. The handle was a bit shorter than I was used to to as I prefer something like a 3.5 handle and the weight was very light and that threw off my shave a bit. I did get a very smooth shave though despite a few bits of razorburn.\n\n​\n\nI've used Reserve before, but I never achieved a great lather with my synthetic. I knew the soap base was very thirsty and I have read Wills advice for how to lather reserve, but it never really clicked. Then I got a nice badger and the additional water saturation from the knot really seemed to make reserve shine. Lather was super slick, very dense and there was no post shave dryness I had previously experienced using my Synthetic. The only Lavender AS I currently have is Tuesday, so I finished off the shave with that.\n\n​\n\nI would love to hear y'all's thoughts on other Lavenders you like. The two I am currently considering are Declaration Grooming \"Pure Lavender\" and Dr. Jon's \"Flowers in the Dark\". I am open to suggestions though.",

It's weird to think that I would have to re-learn how to use a mild razor after using the R41 daily, but I really have to stop myself from buffing to much with this thing. I was able to do that tonight and got a great shave.\n\nGood Sundays to all.",

It wasn't a bad shave per se, but it surely wasn't good either. This cream was graciously loaned along with a tube of blue Proraso and the razor itself. It was fast to lather and worked well enough.\n\nWhen I was done, I was definitely in a hurry so I grabbed the first aftershave I could get my hands on, the Arlington.

And jumping back into my sample stash of Wickham scents.\n\n#### ❧ Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Timeless - Bronze .38 Solid Bar ::: Personna - Vikings Sword ‹2 uses›)*\n\nPretty good match for blade and razor. Felt good. Not as efficient at cutting a small patch near my trouble spot flush, but let's not rush to chalk this up to the equipment. May have just been me. Looking forward to trying this guy out with other blades.\n\nFirst Impression: This guy doesn't offer anything in performance that isn't offered by other razors. So a person with a large collection isn't going to get a performance benefit from it. They would just get a \"now I have a bronze razor\" benefit. However, a shaver with a small collection of razors could benefit from its nice balance between comfort and efficient cutting. It's a good razor, just not super special. But again, that's just based on one use.\n\nAnd it definitely looks better in person than it does in photos!\n\nNo tugging or irritation.\n\n#### ❧ Soap Notes\n*^(Wickham 1912 - Scottish Heather)*\n\nGood soap performance, but I didn't care for the smell.\n\nless than a 1/4 tsp soap + lightly-wet small boar brush + 2.5 tsp water = 6 passes of slick, enjoyable, though only slightly creamy lather.\n\nScent: There is something zesty about this scent that may resembles a mint effect, but probably isn't. Maybe a conifer family or herb scent.\n\nScent Strength: 4-5/10, present during shaving.\n\nBowl - I used the XL version of this bowl:\nhttps://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3392930\n\n\n#### ❧ Brush Notes\n*^(Semogue - 1800 Boar ‹10 uses›)*\n\nvery comfy guy that works well in the splay. Soft tips and medium backbone.\n\n#### ❧ Shave Quality\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Few hairs are showing some tip length (with most being cut flush)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm)\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

This stuff is so easy to load and lather. Practically effortless. One of the easiest soaps I've tried out. Full marks in that regard. Good primary and residual slickness too, which isn't always the case when you build a soap without tallow. Tough to judge the post-shave feel because, well, the blade failed me today.\n\nI noticed that the Shark's sharpness was starting to drop off a little on shave number seven. On this shave, it fell off a fucking cliff. Wow. I should have just replaced my blade mid-shave instead of finishing with the Shark but I didn't. Oh well.\n\nAnyway, Druantia's scent notes are listed as Cypress, ginger, orange; mushroom and rosewood; and amber, cedar, moss, myrrh, oakmoss, sandalwood, and tobacco. I gotta say, that sounds pretty good, and it probably is... if you have the matching aftershave / EdP! Fresh off the puck it smells like a spice cake from the ginger and orange and underlying spicy notes. Yum. Lathered up, it... still smells like cake or cookies or something like that. Still yum. It's a nice mild scent through the shave experience, and then I rinsed my face and it was Gone. Bam. Just like that. If you want to experience the full Oriental perfume experience, the soap won't get you there on its own.\n\nBut you know what? I'm okay with that, because *I like Germanic spicy cookies and cake and this soap smells like that.* If they had sold this soap with the name \"Creepy gingerbread house in the woods and it has a witch inside it who wants to eat abandoned children\" (in keeping with their branding) I would have gone \"nice,\" bought it, and been perfectly satisfied and none the wiser to all those other Oriental notes that got washed off my face before I could detect them.\n\nIf [this recipe](https://www.tasteofhome.com/recipes/granny-s-gingerbread-cake-with-caramel-sauce/) makes your mouth water, you should try Druantia shave soap (and also bake some cake). If you like Oriental perfumes, you should pair it with the matching EdP.",

Elliot 6/8 wedge\n**Post:** Clubman Special Reserve - Oil of Olay Complete\n**Extra Post:** Chatillon Lux skin salve\n\nA really nice Sunday morning shave. I never get a bad lather with Stirling. I always get a nice shave with it. And I always get a good post shave feel. The Shea butter and lanolin are very friendly to my skin. And the huge amount of soap (5.8 oz.) stuffed into a tub for a fantastic price is the cherry on the top.\n\nThis brush. I was this ][ close to getting rid of it several times. It just didn't want to break in. Then I finally realized it was broken in but had quite a different personality than all my other boars. This brush dumps lather like no other brush I own. Also, I think the same trait makes it a tad reluctant to load. I make sure I spend a bit more time loading this thing and it has worked out great. This brush isn't going anywhere.\n\nSunday chores and shit.",

I had a thing for slant razors a few years back, and bought the Superlite to accompany my iKon 102. After a few years of shaving with my red tip, I occasionally go back to one of my old razors. This is one I've never really used all that much; I bought the red tip around the same time and never really looked back at it.\n\nTwo passes up and down; face looks great but neck is still a little stubbly. This was my first time using the red soap; it's advertised as being for tough beards and mine's plenty tough. Excellent lather, but the razor was just too light to really get in there and cut.\n\nFollowed up with the VIBR, which is one of my favorite aftershaves and hasn't seen much love since I started using the Epsilon. Dabbed a bit of the sandalwood cologne on my wrists, back of ears, and chest.",

Super rich so all you need is one pump, and your skin soaks it up like a sponge without feeling greasy/clogging pores.\n\nLove the Oleo canard base from my sample of the WCS Oriental soap. My lady is a huge fan of Mont Blanc Legend/Abercrombie Fierce, so when I found out this soap mimicked the scent I had to jump on it.\n\nSuper easy to dial in, resulting in a rich, Cool Whip-like texture. Solid slickness and a satisfying post-shave.\n\nAfter a run of bad shaves, this was what I needed. Super smooth and close shave, and I smelled perfect for date night.\n\nHave a great day gang.\n",

      "body": "**Pre-Shave:** Hot towel\n\n**Brush:** Custom badger from [WildWest Brushworks](https://imgur.com/a/cicHNJp)\n\n**Safety:** EJ DE87BL\n\n**Razor:** Gillette Platinum\n\n**Soap:** Proraso White\n\n**Aftershave:** Cold towel and Proraso White Aftershave Balm\n\nThis was my first shave with a badger brush. Getting the lather ready was a bit more involved than when I was using a synthetic. I actually enjoy the stiffer, coarser feel of the badger. I also really love the look and feel of the handle from WildWest.\n\nI'm continuing to enjoy the EJ. I don't have much experience with hardware so all I can say is that it works well and feels good.\n\nI know it isn't exactly an 'elite' soap, but I really like the Proraso White. My face is very sensitive, so the White is pretty much ideal. The aftershave is alcohol-free, which I recently figured out was a necessity for me. When I use the White and the aftershave balm I can comfortably shave two passes (one with, one across) and have no redness afterward.",

If you have one of these razors, March 24/14 is prominently stamped on the back. Unfortunately, I grabbed my Canadian version for today's shave, which was patented a few months later on June 9/14. Same razor, different handle - my Canadian one uses a longer lighter hollow handle rather than the shorter heavy one. I swap handles between heads because I prefer lighter razors with the balance point closer to the head and can't stand heavy handles that move the balance point set from the head.\n\nShave was great as usual - with that classic buttering dry toast sound. This is the second loudest razor I own, with the Ever-Ready 1924 Shovelhead being the loudest.\n\nI still really want to like this brush, and since I love horse hair brushes, it's odd that I hate this one so much. It's too dense, too short and too wide, so it's an unyielding wall of hair. Great brush if you're a painter, but horrible brush if you're like me and like to mash and do circles.",

WTG, XTG, and two clean up. A mild shave that could have used a bit more efficient set-up. However, I won't complain as I got no irritation. A bit of stubble left but it was a wonderful shave regardless.\n\n**The Soap** worked well. The scent is neutral for me now and it just smells like a old cabin house. It was a bit displeasing at first but it's alright now. The performance is pretty good. It does the job well with good slickness and protection. It does not have the best post shave but it is average. It's an another go-to soap that I can use any time without being disappointed.\n\n**The Razor and Blade** combination worked well. A mild combination. The blade is pretty efficient in my experience but with the razor, it was very mild. I felt a bit of tugging as I had three days of growth but nothing uncomfortable. I probably should have used a OC razor but I stuck with the good ol EJ89. I overbuffed some areas but still had no irritation. I have a couple stubbles left but most of my face is smooth. I'll take it.\n\n**The Brush** did its job. Still a bit rough on the face if I face lather. However, I bowl lathered today and it was a lot better. I do get a bit thinner lather when I bowl lather but it worked out to be fine. It made plenty of lather and I applied it to my face with no problem. A decent brush in my case.\n\n**The aftershave portion** was great. I haven't used Thayer's in a while so going back to it was awesome. Finishing it with the ice cold balm. mm mm good. I do love some extra menthol at the end. Now I want more menthol for the next shave. haha.\n\nOverall, a great shave. Everything went well except for the couple stubbles left at the end. I could've buffed and felt for those areas but I didn't want to risk getting irritation. With EJ89, I just feel so comfortable shaving. It reduced the three day stubble without much problem and I'm now clean and good to go.",

I was in a bit of a rush this morning. I have a 15 hour shift to look forward to right now. Abe from WCS asked me to do a video for their daily shave, so I tried to be up a little early today to knock it out. Check it out, if you got the time!\n\n\nStirling Soap Co. Deep Blue Sea is an amazing scent, and my favorite from the Stirling line up. Right off the puck I get a strong hit of citrus, and pineapple. Upon lathering I get a slight hint of mint, rounded out by a sweet vanilla. Perfect scent for the spring, and summer time that is quickly approaching us.\n\n\nBrass Blackland Black bird A.K.A \"Brassbird\". Beautifully crafted, and a very hefty razor. The first thing I noticed was how easily, and smoothly the handle screwed into the threads of the head. The brass construction gives this razor a vintage feel, and since it's raw brass it will develop a patina, giving it a vintage look as well. I'm going to try and resist the urge to polish this razor. I like my stuff shiny, and like new. Finding the cutting angle on the razor was really easy. As soon as I found the safety bar it was right there. This razor has a mild face feel, little to no blade feel, and is very efficient. The magical combination of smooth, and efficient. I got a solid 3 pass shave, BBS, with no clean up required. Which is pretty rare.\n\n\nPaladin shaving has been around for quite some time, and has established themselves a very large, and loyal fan base. They offer artisan quality brushes at a premium price point. Offering a variety of unique designs, colors, and material. My brush being the PK-47 style made from Ebonite. The Hand Selected badger is very soft. It also creates, and holds a lather very nicely.\n\n\nChanel. Bleu De Chanel Parfum is the latest offering of Bleu from Chanel. It shares the same scent notes as the rest of the family with the inclusion of cedar, and sandalwood from new Caledonia in place of vanilla. This scent is a darker offering, rounded out by the smoothness, and creaminess of sandalwood. Has good longevity, but projection is lacking. It a great skin scent however, and one must be up close and personal to really take in, and appreciate the scent.\n\n\nOverall. I give this shave a solid 10.",

Need more pink. Hummingbird is fantastic. Nick'd myself a couple times, which is unusual, but perhaps the combination of new razor plus new blade was too much for me at once. Overall though, great shave, and the addition of pink definitely increased my mood. Plus, Hummingbird smells amazinggggg.",

I'm always curious to see how good Chinese manufacturing is getting given the price point.\n\nIt was a good shave - relatively mild, efficient and lots of feedback / blade noise. The DOC meant there were no issues with clogging. Definitely more irritation post shave than my usual iKon 102 though so I don't see it going into regular use. Pretty good for £3.50 plus shipping though.\n\nAfter Cryogen yesterday I wanted the next sample I tried to have a strong scent - since Cryogen has a strong feel but not much of a scent. I picked up a sample of Bon Vivant because I'd heard mixed things about it. It's certainly a strong and interesting scent. My wife's review of it was it smells like hospital disinfectant (specifically TCP for UK folks!), and I can see where she's coming from. There's a *lot* of bitters going on. Not an instant favourite let's say.\n\nHave a good week all!",

Today was my first shave with the new Excelsior base as well as Beaudelaire. I used my Type G, courtesy of /u/Fuckchalzone and followed the directions that Will provided for loading.\n\nFirst let me say, the Excelsior base was a boss. This was some of the most denser and slick lather I have ever shaved with. Performance was top notch. The consistency was like thick, thick yogurt. Slickness was not quite as good as Reserve, but it was an improvement on Glissant. I'm looking forward to seeing some of my favorite soaps in this base. It was very, very pleasant to shave with.\n\nAs far as the scent goes, Beaudelaire was a miss for me. Full disclosure, I love Fougeres, but I've yet to find a soap with mousse de saxe that I like. In Beaudelaires defense the aftershave is the star of the pair and the soap is more like a base that the AS rests on. Scent notes are Mousse de Saxe, Fern, Lavender, Ylang-Ylang, Rose, Sandalwood, Oakmoss, Coumarin. I don't get a lot of these notes. This is a dark Fougere, with something resembling Hollows mixed in with some MdS. It's not fresh and green, I get decaying vegetation, old wood and musk.\n\nI think a a lot of people are going to like Beau, but can't get past the soap. I actually love the AS, and I think it would add some depth to a lighter Fougere. It's too bad because the Excelsior base performed exceptionally.\n\nIn other news, I managed to knock out two additional photos last night and I thought y'all might like the chance to decide my SOTD photo for tomorrow. Would you rather see a B&M \"Night Music\" or P&B \"Whitechapel\"?\n\nRobot",

Good enough.\n\n\nOne note: This is my second spring as a wetshaver. The first spring didn't really register with me. I was still hunting for scents I wanted year round. This spring, I'm really, *really* into the seasonals. I'm surprised with myself. Really wanted some Fern today; it's crisp and clean enough for any season, but it feels apt currently.\n\n\n**The Song:** This group is a recommendation I got in a packie. Tried listening to a full album, and this song was my pick from the songs to which I listened.\n\n\nI really love classic jazz, and Coltrane is perhaps my favorite musician of all time. However, modern jazz has always left me wanting. Is there a way for a modern jazz artist to be bad-ass and dirty, but still high musicianship? I'm not sure, haven't found anyone yet, had high hopes for this group, but let down.\n\n\nGive it a shot, you may like it more than me.",

Zero nicks somehow, but I'll be damned if the aftershave didn't light me on fire! I didn't pay attention to angle whatsoever and I highly regret it. I definitely wouldn't recommend doin that with an unfamiliar razor and the worst part is that I knew better. (-‸ლ) Oh well. Never hurts to have a lesson driven home a bit better. Everything else is going along swimmingly. I finally cut my FitD to pieces and pressed em back into the container. Definitely gonna need to actually shred it next time with some sort of shredder or grinder instead of just using a knife. Call that a lesson learned as well.",

On a lark, put a little water in the Cella bowl before showering. I've been trying to 3017 this tub, as it's the last of my first kilo brick, and brick #2 is sitting in the closet in all of its still-white goodness. The water definitely woke the soap up, as it lathered even better than it normally does and was super-slick to boot.\n\nGreat shave and post shave today. Only real issue is that I wasn't paying close attention on my 2nd pass and took a nice gouge out of my lower lip.",

He told me that the focus of their new base is for a better post shave feel and I can say that it delivered. I still have to use it a couple more times for an accurate review, but so far I really enjoyed the first impressions. The soap was slick and afterwards left my skin feeling nice and soft. I'm looking forward to the official release in April.\n\nAs for me, I'm glad spring has finally arrived! I have definitely received my fair share of snow during the winter and I'm really looking forward to warmer weather. I also discovered recently that putting in a new water heater solo is alot less fun than it looks. I can't wait to attempt the water softener!\n",

Every time I smell it I go, Whoah that's good. Necromantic tells a story of interconnectedness. In Buddhism it's referred to as \"no self\" or \"non-existence\" but that's confusing to people. Basically, nothing is completely independent. Everything is made up of other things and can't exist without any one of those things. No mud - no lotus. Necromantic has a side of life with the rose and wisteria which only exist because of their parts; sun, air, water, etc. The other side of Necromantic represents the life of the floral forward dying and becoming the earth (dirt, oakmoss) that will in turn feed the life of the next rose. Without one, the other can't exist. No mud - No lotus. It's all in there. I use my shaving time as a time for reflection and meditation. For me to get that soap in my hands it took the stars, the clouds, the death of plants and animals for the earth, the artisan, their ancestors, the truck that carried it, the ancient decay that made the fuel, etc. Take away one of those things and the soap doesn't exist. That's the idea of no-self but easier to grasp if it's called interconnectedness.\n\nAnyway, it lathers so easy and is a pleasure to shave with. I wish the scent stayed with me longer so I just ordered the splash and edp. Which couldn't exist without.... okay okay you get the idea. 😂\n\nSpring break but work doesn't give a single shit about that. Be handsome my friends.",

I'll switch it up again once I'm finished a first pass through all the samples. After ploughing through the vegan soaps last week it's back to tallow!\n\nKraken's schtick is \"what if you had a barbershop... *by the sea??????????*\" This soap is built on a variation on the classic barbershop accord (in this case: bergamot, basil, patchouli, and oakmoss) with the addition of \"aqua,\" \"salt water,\" kelp, and agave. I put quotation marks around those first two because who knows what they're using to achieve those notes? Water and salt water have no odour on their own. It's only because of the things IN the water that we can discern any fragrance from them.\n\nAnyway off the puck, this stuff smells like some sort of refreshing liquid hand soap. That's the only way I can describe it: that phony \"fresh water\" smell. Lathered up and on the face, the scent was mild in strength, the \"water\" notes faded, and the scent was pretty much pure bergamot and powdery oakmoss. Post-shave as the bergmot faded it revealed a mild patchouli, leaving: patchouli and oakmoss (i.e. roughly the same thing as most barbershop soaps leave on my face).\n\nBetween this and Seville as barbershop soaps, I prefer Seville's opening.\n\nHow was performance? It lathered up about average. Slickness was not as good as I expected it to be. Also, this was the first soap I've tried that I had a painful reaction to. Pure burning through the whole shave, as though I had lathered up my soap with rubbing alcohol instead of water. As a result I can't really comment fairly on the post-shave feel. Sorry folks.\n\nEdit: tried out this Polo Green dupe by Belcam. The real stuff has a hefty tobacco note in its current formulation that I don't care for; it seems to have been replaced by a sort of \"cedar pencil shavings\" note in the dupe and it reminds me of using the pencil sharpener on those giant red pencils in 2nd grade. Beyond that difference, they seem pretty similar so far. I'll have to compare them side by side some day when I can stomach two sprays simultaneously... It's intense stuff.",

The R3 shave last time didn't feel as comfortable so likely I'm used to the angles for the R4 plate now. Voshkod blade was okay - I found myself thinking the Astra blade seemed smoother.\n\nI love this DG soap - it is a very luxurious lather that with the tuxedo makes for a really nice shave. The DG aftershave is just awesome. I think the DG set is slowly becoming my favourite performer and the scent is great pairing with the warmer weather.\n\nHave a great Monday all!\n",

We had roughly 10 people in attendance with software and hardware spread across most of the tables in the back half of Collins Pub. I made a few trades and then got the high score (19 out of 20 because I know what state Cadinsor's from but didn't know what country Treet blades come from) on trivia. The tub of Man from Mayfair was part of my trivia prize and the decant of Epsilon Blue was a gift from one of the guys. Made for a pretty classic shave this morning.",

The Astra Platinum made the Bronze so smooth and efficient. And I was reminded how much I love the fatty slickness of Bison soap!\n\n#### ❧ Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Timeless - Bronze .38 Solid Bar ::: Astra - Platinum ‹14 uses›)*\n\nRedeemed this razor from yesterday! What a great combination. Smooth and still gave me a superbly close shave by the end.\n\nNo tugging or irritation.\n\n#### ❧ Soap Notes\n*^(Declaration Grooming - Bison Gratiot League Square)*\n\nBison Tallow. Crazy slick. My fav base from DG.\n\n30 second load with lightly-wet soft boar brush + 3 tsp water = 6 passes of crazy slick, creamy, amazing lather.\n\nScent: I can't describe this thing. Just awesome and manly.\n\nScent Strength: 4-5/10, nicely present during shaving.\n\nBowl - I used the XL version of this bowl:\nhttps://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3392930\n\n\n#### ❧ Brush Notes\n*^(Zenith - B10 Boar Red ‹11 uses›)*\n\nContinuing to delight in this brush. Soft with medium backbone.\n\n#### ❧ Shave Quality\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Smooth\n*Neck*: Smooth\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Cut flush to where I just see the tips (above average for me)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm)\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

Tons of blade feel, feels unpleasant as I shave -- but mows the stubble down like a minigun in a wheat field, with even a moderate sharpness blade, like the Bolzi, and never leaves a whit of irritation or the slightest hint of a weeper. It's like the Hitman of Stubble - cold, unlovable, professional, and highly efficient. Aesthetics are really nice for the BB also, unlike most hitmen.\n* Blade: I think the key to a more pleasant shave with the BB is to use a moderately sharp blade. When I use the BB with a 7:00 Yellow or a GSB, it feels too damn surgical. But using BB with something like a Personna Blue or Derby Extra feels overly scrapey and does not give a clean BBS easily. The high end of moderate Bolzano is just about perfect with the BB.\n* Soap: Christmas scent? I think not. Feels just as good to use in March. Love the base also. Can't hardly wait for all the current Glissant line to be Excelsiorized...",

Trumper Sandalwood cologne\n\nRushed shave unfortunately. I typically have zero trouble with THB soaps but today's lather was quite airy without enough time to fix it. It was more of a touch-up shave so I just ran with it. Did two passes on my face WTG then XTG, but only once on my neck WTG.\n\nI've also gotten a handle on using the PolSilvers. It's only gotten smoother with each use and I'm incredibly impressed with it.\n\nThankfully, no real irritation. The shave itself serviceable, but I loved the combination of scents between the soap, splash, and fragrance. All very complementary and resulting in some seriously positive feedback from The Lady.",

The winning theme for 2017 was Jack the Ripper and according to Trythatsoap the scent notes were inspired by victims of Jack The Ripper.\n\nTheming is deeply moody and basing it around a series of murders feels somewhat tasteless. Others may not care so much, but personal options aside I can admit the art styling for this jar is... unique, or at least it was until the promo pictures for The Club surfaced on Instagram yesterday, but we will come back to that.\n\nThe jar is glossy black and the blood splatter has actually been applied via a raised vinyl label to mimic the appearance of one of Jacks victims. Does this cross the line? I'm not sure. Artistically it's a bold move, any time you incorporate skin into a photo it's naturally going to draw the eye and with the especially luridness of this label it may be a hard pass for some.\n\nScents in Whitechapel are noted as the following : Leather Vetiver Sandalwood Chocolate Jasmine Ylang-Ylang and going into the shave I expected a smoke, leather, sweet and dark. Instead what I got was the scent of a Rum and Coke. Honestly, I can't make this up. I'm beginning to worry my nose may be broken, but I clearly got the scent of cola and rum. Post lather some of the smoke from Vetiver came out. The soap was tallowed based and similar in performance to Stirling with a bit more slickness. I elected for a two pass shave and after the fact was left wondering what AS to reach for. In hindsight I should have gone with Hollows but I had Clubman close at hand so I just splashed some on. It was a fine, but coming off my shave with Excelsior yesterday, somewhat unremarkable.\n\nCircling back, I wanted to get y'all a thoughts on good taste in label design. As previously mentioned, The Club has announced plans for a new soap \"Brooklyn\" we also have Whitechapel and then to a lesser extent we have MLS Panty Dropper. What is the line between good taste and being crass in label design? We can agree that sex sells. I don't have raw numbers, but I suspect that the very large majority of wetshavers are men. Is The Club playing up on their target market? How much is too much?\n\nRobot",

KOB certainly did not disappoint with the deep, rich vanilla and incredibly thicccc (Yup, 4 c's), voluptuous, and dense lather it yielded. Now I just need Lav Sublime in this base, and I think I could happily retire from the soap hustle (at least for a few weeks 😋).\n\nI think I may actually prefer the OC c plate to the d much to my surprise. Not quite as efficient, but significantly smoother. More testing to be done with other blades, however.\n\nHappy shaves!\n\n",

Got a head shave and face shave in one go. I did have to reload the brush, because, as it turns out, T+S doesn't like sitting in a hot scuttle. Live and learn. I don't use the base often, but it always surprises me how great it is compared to how weak the lather looks. No nicks, no weepers.\n\n\nNot sure how to feel about *Fenchurch.* Sometimes I like it, sometimes I don't. Today is a day I don't like it. There's something in there that reminds me of Play-Doh. Usually when I have a love-hate relationship with a scent, it means it's time to go. Maybe it'll be on the Bazaar soon. Let me know if you want to swap for it. It's 90%+.\n\n\n\n**The Song:** It's worth a listen or three. Phenomenal sax player (and group). Sort of reminds me of Return to Forever, which is definitely a good thing. Hope someone besides me and /u/giganticsteps enjoys.\n\n\n**Great shaves all**",

Sadly, I never got to try the Floid Blue before it was discontinued, so as far as which one smells the most like it, I'm clueless. The Furbo definitely has a lot more menthol chill than the Epsilon, and is much more strongly fragranced. That being said, there's a musty, leathery note in the Furbo, and I think the clean citrusy Epsilon smell is going to win out for me.\n\nJust did a single pass today, to try and give my skin a bit of a rest. Since I had real good results yesterday with pre-soaking the Cella, I did the same today for the Vito's, since the soap is a lot harder. Very impressed with the results again; soap lathered on very easily and had wonderful cushioning and glide.\n\nEDIT ONE HOUR LATER: The Furbo is a lot more drying on my skin than the Epsilon; it doesn't have the glycerin of the latter.",

First shave with lamplight penance. There's so much to digest here. This is definitely my first fragrance of any kind that would fall under the \"stinky\" category. I definitely get the lamp oil scent, and barely get the berry notes is I look for them. The soap mellowed out as I used it, but still a strong, masculine scent. This is not generally my first choice in terms of scents, but I can appreciate the complexity of it.\n\nThis was also my first time using Icarus. Performance was top notch, really enjoyed it and was easy to work with.\n\nMy last midterm is in about an hour, can't wait to have that over with. Happy Tuesday everyone!",

Durga's Companion is lemongrass and grapefruit scented and \"Inspired by the tiger companion of Durga, a warrior goddess of the Hindu pantheon.\" The lemongrass is strong off the tub. The soap appeared sort of puffy in the tub with an almost play-dough look to it. I scooped some into my bowl and when I pressed it down it really started to [glisten](https://imgur.com/a/mKYpe27) . The soap became intensely shiny and very soft like a croap. It was pretty sticky as well. I used way too much as usual and loaded until my badger could take no more. In the shower the face lathering worked Durga's old chum into a quality thick and slick lather. Not thick and slick \"for a vegan base\", but really thick and really slick. The grapefruit really comes out in the lathering process and the scent combination is simple but enjoyable. My face tends to get tight and dry with a face lather but the post shave dryness was only a 2/10 for me. I wanted to see what kind of staying power the scent had but got excited to throw some LRC on and forgot. Next time.\n\nLotus Eater Soap company is a husband and wife team named Rebecca and Jacob, operating out of Southern Utah. The shipment from them was really fast and I had a tracking number within a couple hours of placing my order. I really like the performance of this soap and will look to see what's coming from them in the future.",

Makes for a very slick lather that results in a comfortable shave.\n\nRockwell was stellar but I'm not digging the Voshkod blade. I had some mild razor burn on my cheek and a couple nicks on my neck. Maybe it's a bit too sharp for my technique? Time will tell.\n\nHave a happy Tuesday folks!\n",

Finished off with a bit of Delor de Treget toner and I am a happy camper.\n\nThe craziness begins tomorrow. Tiniest human if off school (parent/teacher conferences) but the teenbeast is not and the wife is in Florida for work. Thus, I get to work from home and keep an eye on the smallest. Wife gets home from Florida tomorrow night, so she'll keep an eye on the smallest on Thursday. Then, on Thursday night, we head to the airport to begin the Spring Break trip. We're meeting my parents and my sister (with her husband and kids) for a nice relaxing week on a tropical beach. Oh, and my team here in Seattle will be launching a major feature while I'm out of the country, so I'm gonna be bringing the work laptop along and hoping for a stable internet connection. Fun!",

When I ordered the full thing, I was disappointed to find out I mistakenly ordered the cream and not the soap and nearly planned on sending it back. But after checking out some of the feedback on Catie's Bubbles, I decided to hold off and give it a shot.\n\nThis was my first go at a Catie's Bubbles base, and my first cream since I ran through a TOBS Sandalwood. I'm thoroughly impressed.\n\nLoaded a bit more than I thought I needed, and as a result it behaved closer to a soap in terms of how much I had to work it and how much water it needed. I was rewarded with a truly incredible lather - thick like Greek yogurt, with the density, slickness, and post-shave to compete with anything out there. Supremely impressed.\n\nAs for this aroma, it really does speak to me. Floral with spicy mid notes, and a strong woodsy/amber backbone to support it. The description on the tub label describes it to a tee.",

Of the 5 scents I own by them, only 1 is still available for sale on the site now (theoretically, as it is sold out right now). It seems that there are no real product concepts or \"stories\", and the scents are cranked out every few months and then phased out -- for a few months? Years? Forever?\n* Anyway, I mention this because I really like Mallard I, the scent. I would like to recommend it, but I am not at all sure that anyone will ever have the chance to buy it ever again. Great scent, not sure I should even bother telling y'all why.\n* Performance is excellent, as it has generally been for all the GD soaps save the vegan base.\n* I wish GD would just calm down as a brand. Make two bases. Have 6 or 8 core scents, and another 4 or so that rotate quarterly. Write some marketing copy for the bases and the scents, tell us why they're great. The existing process has none of this, feels more like a pop-up online store that will be closed in another month or two.\n* **Frag**: Rose chypre, full of woods and spices, animalic and powdery too. The male version of Clinique Aromatics Elixir, and one of Bernard Chant's finest scents for men. He was a master, and this ornate complex, extroverted perfume design has become very rare in the modern world. Fortunately, A900 has become dirt cheap, so everyone who can afford a used video game can easily try a ride in this olfactory time tunnel back to 1973.",

Tried the new Sunday Funday scent from Dr Jons. And another blade in my new-ish Timeless Bronze.\n\n#### ❧ Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Timeless - Bronze .38 Solid Bar ::: PolSilver ‹14 uses›)*\n\nMaybe not quite as good for me as the Astra plat from yesterday, but still a very nice shave, in terms of comfort and results.\n\nNo tugging or irritation.\n\n#### ❧ Soap Notes\n*^(Dr Jon's - Sunday Funday Extravaganza - Burning Bay)*\n\nDr Jon's performance is very good. So I always look forward to his monthly releases. Nice glide.\n\n30 second load with lightly-wet boar brush + 2.5 tsp water = 5 passes of slick, enjoyable, almost-creamy lather.\n\nScent: Kinda liked it. It was just too weak... for me.\n\nScent Strength: 3-4/10, barely present during shaving.\n\nBowl - I used the XL version of this bowl:\nhttps://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3392930\n\n\n#### ❧ Brush Notes\n*^(Whipped Dog - Boar 24mm ‹43 uses›)*\n\nReturned to this brush after a few months without it. Wanted to compare it to the current Boar-a-thon brushes I'm training up.\n\nIt was so nice. Medium backbone and truly soft tips without a hint of scritch. Better than the young Semogues I'm working with lately, but that's hardly fair since this guy has 42 uses to their 10. It was more comparable with the Zenith that's in my rotation. More bristle density, while keeping the tips on the face for a great feel.\n\n#### ❧ Shave Quality\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Cut flush to where I just see the tips (above average for me)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm)\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

      "body": "Not sure if an early AM shave counts, but technically it *was* Tuesday, so SOTD 3/26/19.\n\nPre: Hot shower, cold Omnipollo Bianca Blueberry Maple Pancake Lassi Gose\nBrush: Razorock Snowman\nRazor: Karve B (SB)\nBlade: Feather\nLather: SW Tres Matres\nPost: SW Tres Matres\nMusic: [Goblin, Suspiria Theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pins1y0XAa0)\n\nI stopped wetshaving because I'm lazy and don't think about airline regulations. I threw away my Tech in Portugal years ago because I took a bus to and a flight from. When I got back from my trip, I figured I'd get another when I got around to it... I never got around to it. I think it's been about 8 years since, and I'm really happy that I'm back to enjoying my morning (or post-midnight, tonight) ritual.\n\nFirst time trying Tres Matres and I really love it. There's a lot of damp earth, and that's what I wanted out of it. As it wears on, it's much more distinctly floral, but that's nice for spring. Although at this point, I'm pretty sure I'm not picking up any more scent than that of the EdC.\n\nI really wanted to talk about the scent, but I have to mention the beer as well. I rode into this shave on a saccharine nightmare of IHOP blueberry maple syrup and freshly squeezed lemonade. The diners by me are open 24/7 and never stop serving breakfast, and I guess I've always enjoyed pancakes more as a midnight snack, so I enjoyed the whole affair.\n\nEditing for clarity, I got screened for having the Tech. This happened in the wake of a bunch of Mumbai-style airport attack threats, and my Portuguese is basically limited to \"Tudo bem.\" I know I could have taken the blade out and made a case to bring it, but in my mind it was easier to junk it and make my flight.",

Downed a few glasses and showered. Grabbed the best soap I could for a bob Dylan shave. Something free and ragged like the free wheeler himself. Barrister and mann roam.\n\nI started lathering and got a scent I haven't smelled in about three years, the unforgettable scent of leather, tobacco, dirt, and smoke. Dry, dirty, and damn good. Started face lathering and started shaving with my rockwell. Due to the fact that I've already been sniffin too many eggs, talkin to too many people and drinking too many kegs. Despite the glissant slickness, I nicked myself pretty damn quickly. I'm to the point where I can drink like a fish, crawl like a snake, bite like a turkey and slam like a drake.\n\nWtg and xtg go fine, but when I get to atg is when the blood goes onto the tracks. I cut the SHIT out of myself. I finish up with some roam tonique and decide to give the roam edt a try, it smells just as amazing as the soap and tonique.",

      "body": "[SOTD 27th of March, 2019 \"13\"](https://i.imgur.com/hgJSl6o.jpg)\n\n- Razor: Karve B\n- Blade: Astra\n- Soap: Dr. Jon's \"13\"\n- Brush: That Darn Rob \"Pueblo\" w/ 26MM SHD\n- Aftershave: Declaration Grooming \"Darkfall\"\n\nDr. Jon's 13 was a limited custom soap made for the Wet Shaver Review. Try that shave scent notes include Oud, Hedione, Musk and Iso-E, (whatever that is). The fragrance was described as dark, musky and floral all at the same time by the Dr. Jon's product page.\n\nThe soap is Vegan and very firm in nature. Scent was minimal off the puck and remained minimal throughout the shave. I felt as if I had to go hunting for the scent, I could tell it was there but it was very light (I'm told that the EdT and AS are both stronger scent wise, but I can't attest to that). I bloomed the soap and lathered my SHD badger extremely well. The lather was thick and very dense and not what I expected from a vegan soap. Plenty of slickness and my Karve continues to do tons of work. Honestly, the B plate on the Karve feels about right for daily shaves. I've gotten to the point that I feel very comfortable shaving with.\n\nThree very relaxing passes left me feeling smooth without any sort of irritation. Skin did feel dry, especially compared to something like Wholly Kaw and I felt the need for some AS with this one. I elected for Darkfall. Man I love the way that stuff smells. Dark and spicy, it's very good.\n\nGrowing up, I spent a fair amount of time in tattoo shops. I have full sleeves on my left and right arm and my right leg is fairly inked up as well. I got my first tattoo on the day I turn 18. My father who actually was a sailor, Took me down and put $200 towards my first piece of ink. You know you spent too much time in the shop, when you invite your tattoo artist to your wedding. This photo felt very familiar to me. I spent a lot of time under the needle and taking the photo reminded me of the high-pitched buzzing in the cat scratch feeling as the needle applied into your skin. The flash shirt sheets are iconic to any studio, but please take my advice always get custom work done. My favorite style of tattooing is classic americana. This style was most popular in the 30s and 40s and has since made a resurgence. When you think of the classic Sailor Jerry style tattoo, you're thinking of americana.\n\nBack to work this evening, then I'll be getting ready to head to LA for some work for a few days. If anyone wants to grab a beer in the Long Beach area next week. Let me know.\n\nRobot\n",

Could sit there and huff it all day if I weren't going to be accused of being a weirdo. The base whips up into a gorgeous lather with ease for me, and I'm seriously contemplating getting in on that West Egg excellence.\n\nEvery time I pick up a synthetic, I'm reminded why I seldom use them. The face feel just isn't anywhere near as luxurious as badger, or even a broken in boar.\n\nThe OC C plate certainly did its job as I tested it out with a brand new blade. Gonna give the D a go again though to see if I find it any more comfortable.\n\nHappy hump day! 🐪🐫",

Not bad, and definitely nice to know how I respond to it, but still rough overall. Still trying to slowly kill that tub of FitD and gettin closer every use. I'm really gonna miss it when it's gone, but it'll always be back, so I'll be ok.\n\nFor the main event, today is my first use of Nefertiti. I ordered a sample of it when I ordered Biblio, and actually let my wife use it first. She was a bit ambivalent to it for herself, and I wasn't around her that day to judge it for myself. I found it on her dresser last night and just knew that today had to be my day. Once again, I'm staying away from scent notes in an attempt to train my nose. So far, I'm picking up a woody base with maybe some incense on top. It's deep and dark and mysterious without coming across as dirty. It's totally an enjoyable scent and I can't wait to see how it evolves as time goes by!",

They'll be delivered soon. Until then the Proraso White still feels good. Even after I get better soaps I'll continue to use the aftershave balm.

I'm putting what feels like a ton of soap in there but it might not be enough. I didn't get the thick lather that I'm used to and it broke down a little too easy. The brush is really soft though and feels good, but is a bit of a hog. I'll keep at it.\n\nTwo Kings is big on rose and oud. It's got a floral scent at first but then the oud and oakmoss kick in and give it some depth. The incense spices it up for a nice scent that should wear well in the EdP when it's released.\n\nShortly after I took the picture, I heard some cries for help. There was a surf advisory and a surfer had lost his board and was caught in the ever present rip that flows out along Crystal Pier. He was struggling and waving for assistance. The waves were big and there were only two other surfers in the water. They heard the crowd on the pier and paddled over in what seemed like a super slow fashion. They held onto the guy until lifeguards could paddle out and all was well. The excitement was quite a contrast to the peaceful photo taking I had just completed. Glad the guy was safe. I didn't start filming [the video](https://youtu.be/DwDxpyNPJlo) until the guy was safe. It was intense and I didn't want to capture homies demise.\n",

I was optimistic when I started out, but I've more or less given up now. At best, these soaps smell like \"some things that live in forests,\" but none of them smell like *being in a forest.*\n\nThat disappointment aside, The Trail does smell okay. Scent notes are listed as lavender, rainwater, and sage up top; geranium, juniper, and pine in the heart; and a base of fir, frankincense, oakmoss, and pine tar. It's a bit of a medium-light scent strength and I could only really pick out the sage, juniper, pine, and maybe a little lavender. Maybe frankincense? Not sure, I don't know that note very well. The scent didn't stick around much post-shave.\n\nSpeaking of post shave: performance. Lathered nicely, painted on nice and thick and shiny... ultimately wasn't very slick and had next to zero residual slickness. Post-shave feel was about average. I'm surprised because NO has such a good reputation around here. Maybe I didn't use enough water after all. I'll give Lonestar a try Friday and see if it goes better with some more water... and then I'll break out an old standby over the weekend, something I know I can trust, and see how it compares as a solid reference point.",

There's probably one or two shaves left, but I had a hell of a time getting a good lather off of the incredibly small puck left at the bottom of the tub. This resulted in a rough shave that was clearly from lack of slickness. I tried scooping it out and putting it in my scuttle for the final shaves, but I couldn't. So fuck it.\n\nCologne Russe is one of my favorite B&M scents. To me, it's a perfect \"cologne\" scent. Very spicy, very perfumey. I just really like it and think it's a versatile scent.\n\nThat said, I'm not buying anymore of it. I have too many damn soaps. It's nice to take one off the board.",

In a continent of dull Euro scent designs, Eufros stands out for strong and interesting scent work.\n* **Brush:** The \"basic bastard\" of shaving brushes. Widely available, looks teeny at a \"mere\" 23mm, but this brush has aged superlatively well and is still a great intro to the merits of $100 badgers. And 23mm is really quite enough for virtually all facial shaving tasks.",

It took me a while to dial it in because I overloaded, but after adding about a gallon of water it became a super dense, creamy and slick lather. The scent is nice but on the light side. It kinda bounces back and forth between the two notes to my nose. Overall I like it and will be trying to pick up a tub of Sonder when it drops. Nice job u/mammothben!\n\n​",

Do I like face lathering? Do I like peppermint in my shaving soap? And exactly how much water do I add to this soap? It's really finicky, I've used it about 6 times and it's always just off. Thought about breaking out the little measuring spoons, but I went with 2 nickels loaded into the center of a damp brush and just kept working it. It took about 5 minutes to get a nice lather, but it can be done. Maybe a bigger knot would do me better? I got the Amici mainly to learn about face lathering without making a mess, but it is a tiny bit small.\n\nThis soap has a true one-note scent-- candy cane. I got it as a stocking stuffer from my fiancee, and as it turns out, I like it well enough.",

I got the GD pre shave withy last purchase from them, so I used it on half my face today to see if there was a difference. I detected none...All I did was apply the pre shave to my face after the shower and lathered right on top. Am I doing something wrong?\n\nIn any case, no pre shave is really needed for a base like Excelsior. It's the slickest soap I've ever used. Perhaps next time I try it with Proraso or some other such old school soap.\n\nI perched my GC head on the Charcoal Handle. It's a shorter and lighter handle than the \"super knurl\" or the \"radio handle\". It works really well and I think the GC has found a new forever home.\n\nAll in all a great shave, although this blade seems toast. Has a couple minor draggy weepers (maybe I just overshaved?)\n\nIn any case, let hump day commence!\n",

South wind 5 to 15 mph, with gusts as high as 25 mph. High tide at 6:32 this evening.\n\n**Razor/Blade:** Decided to put away the Schick Grip for the next few days, as come April 1st I start shaving my head again, and the Schick is the only one I use for that. So I reached for the razor that still had a blade in it. Can't quite remember how many shaves this blade has on it, but it's towards the end of it's life. Just wasn't that comfortable.\n\n**Soap:** Part One of today's theme is the *Shave of Fire and Ice*. I don't pull this soap out often, mostly just special occasions, as it's the wife's favorite scent and it burns the bejeebus outta my face. Performance is very nice. Marco'd it up with loading/lathering, ended up loading too much and had enough for another 2-3 passes.\n\n**Post:** Part Two of *Shave of Fire and Ice*. It's been a good while since I've pulled out either *Taum Sauk* or *Colbeck*, my two most heavily mentholated post-shave products. I decided to go with Taum Sauk because smelling like a mountain top seems to evoke more an **Ice** vibe than **Gin and Tonic** would.\n\nOver all a very nice shave this morning, just wish it didn't have to be so GD early. Have a nice Thursday everyone!",

      "body": "[SOTD 28th of March, 2019 \"Sweet Lemon\"](https://i.imgur.com/CwKcHnH.jpg)\n\n* **Razor**: Karve B\n* **Blade**: Astra\n* **Soap**: Declaration Grooming \"Sweet Lemon\"\n* **Brush**: That Darn Rob \"Pueblo\" w/ 26MM SHD\n* **Aftershave**: Art of Shaving Lemon Balm\n\n***Edit***: [*You trusted me and I failed you.*](https://imgur.com/gallery/qN6nE2W) *I know I suggested this theme and I didn't even follow through, my bad. I intended to get some cinnamon soap and some menthol A/S and frankly, I forgot.*\n\nI'm a sucker for a good lemon scent. Guilty confession, when I started wetshaving, I actually made the crossover into creams and soaps before tiptoeing into safety razors. The first cream that truly sold me on the transition was the Art of Shaving \"Lemon Cream\". I know Art of Shaving gets a bad wrap around here, and I think its not unjustified. For what I spent on my first Badger from them, I could today get a Turn and Shave or That Darn Rob brush that would perform twice as well. Regardless, that's neither here nor there.\n\nTwo weeks ago I was asking in the daily question thread for a good lemon soap. I got some great recommendations from lots of feedback from some regulars on wetshaving including /u/erik_shaves /u/Hyvasuomi79 /u/Ugmug /u/miRNA183 and /u/EldrormR Thanks to that thread, in addition to lots of advice, I was hooked up with penny samples of Latha Limon, Arko and Eleven Sicilian Lemon. I was also pointed in the direction of some DG Sweet Lemon. Thank you to everyone who helped me out and thanks to y'all, I was able to really narrow down out of the four options the lemon that was right for me and in this case it was Declaration Grooming \"Sweet Lemon\".\n\nTry that soap lists only two notes for Sweet Lemon: Lemon and Coconut. I think if you only read the name of the label, you would think this a sweet scent. It really is not. The scent despite only having two notes listed feels much more complex. It smells like something closer to a floury coconut, lemon cake. It smells like something resembling a baked good. The lemon is not sharp or in your face, its slightly rounded and balanced by the coconut. Its one of those scents that makes you wish you could eat it.\n\nThe soap base for Sweet Lemon is Icarus. I was already a big fan of Darkfall so I knew the quality of Icarus. For those unfamiliar its a mix of bison, lamb tallow and goats milk. The soap is very thirsty, but when lathered correctly, it is nice and dense while providing lots of slickness. I shaved using my Karve with an Astra. I feel like the Astra is on its way out and I'll likely be replacing it tomorrow. Honestly, the Karve just feels *right*, I've shaved with a Maggards, a Rockwell and a Merkur and of the four the Karve is the razor I keep going back to.\n\nPost shave I grabbed some of my remaining AoS Lemon Balm. I've been saving this stuff for over two years and ever so occasionally I will use some. It felt like a good match. I don't tend to buy an aftershave unless I truly love a soap. I know there are some people here that are big on sets and I don't know if I am there yet. That said, I put in an order today at Maggard's for one of the remaining Sweet Lemon aftershaves they had in stock.\n\nIn other news, I might have gone a little crazy with Maggards today. As some of y'all might have seen, Noble Otter was restocked there. I have full sets of Barbarr, Two Kings and Flying Hide on order and I am very excited to add them into the mix. *(P.S.* /u/Ugmug *I blame you for the Two Kings, thanks for the sample)*. I've become really impressed with Noble Otter as of late. I know I'm signing to the choir here, but Cody makes some awesome stuff. I get off work in a few hours and hopefully I can see my kids for a few hours before I get some rest. I never minded night shift's before having children, but now that I do, I know its not just about me or my choices. I know what I do has an impact on my kids and how much they see their dad.\n\nHave a good Thursday,\n\nRobot",

The EdT matches the soap and aftershave perfectly and is a must buy to complete the experience.\n\nAnother forgotten Theme Thursday, probably because I shave late the evening before and don't look ahead of time.

Sakura Musk has a really intoxicating smell. I keep smelling the puck. It doesn't have the protectiveness of other soaps but was plenty slick and it left my face feeling pretty decent afterward.",

This one is from CBL soaps, a very soft croap using waygu beef tallow. CBL I've known since B&B where he was making soap as a hobby and he even made me a soap since there weren't many incensey soaps on the market when I first joined. The soap available on the market now is quite interesting- for me it explodes in big, airy lather similar to MWF. I was ready for it to be a terrible shave that I've associated with big, airy lathers, but it actually resulted in a really slick, comfortable experience with a good post shave. I'll be using this more to try and see if I can dial it in a little bit but I really like it now.",

This smells wonderful. The scent is very similar to WWSC Peace Pipe. Fenchurch is sweeter, softer on the wood, and heavier on the tobacco than Peace Pipe, which I think are all improvements over the latter. Easily one of my top three scents.",

I finally dialed in the base, and decided to ignore all of you and overload like I normally do, and it worked out wonderfully. I guess that's just a case of YMMV\n\nThis was the first time I've used a reserve splash, and honestly I was quite disappointed. I got a TON of the reserve funk people were talking about the other day. Like it did not even smell like Seville. I am also on the hunt for an AS that stops my skin from getting tight, and the only thing that does that for me is thayers. I was hoping this one would do it for me, but I still had to add thayers at the end. Oh well, the hunt continues.\n\nOne more till the weekend!",

I don't often like very strong scents, but this one is fun. I think I'm finally starting to get Icarus dialed in as well.\n\nFor their price point, I'm not sure you can beat these SHD knots. There's certainly khots that are equal, but I don't see much of a step up until you get into the hand-tied knots.\n\nAlso, next time I need to moisturize with this combo (which I did later because of some irritation). The DCCC isn't super drying, but it's not moisturizer.",

And it's not lost on me that this might be how the oh-so-cold but sophisticated Night King might run his shave den. Paired decently with the icy but commandeering Aventus inspired and mentholated Executive Man Splash. CDNIM and I'm ready to dominate any foe.\n\n**//Hardware**\n\nThe icy looking brush for today is a beautiful and luxurious performing Elite Razor Handle and knot. Really fit the theme!\n\nThere really isn't a razor in my collection that could better represent the badass-ness of Game of Thrones than the Charcoal Goods brass razor. Absolutely fire 🔥performance, cutting down hairs like Jon Snow cutting down white walkers in the north.\n\nThe magnum Hammered Handle that Charcoal produces is fit for a sword wielded by the chosen one - Azor Ahai.\n\nGlad I could participate fully today.

I didn't feel like using a soap that burns. I have a couple that tingle but MR Roam seemed like a better fit. For Ice I went with First Snow. It reminds me of ice and it has the word Snow in it.

Lather felt much better than last time with performance. I didn't quite get the same post-shave feel as the Icarus base though - maybe need to play around with it more. The scent is really good - the gf requested it specifically this time.\n\nThe Voshkod blade is still performing okay but I don't get the same feel as the Astra. I also seem to have some small bumps on my neck that keep re-appearing after my shave. Maybe I need to wait a few more days to recover.\n\nOnto some good news! - I finally bought my first badger brush from Yaqi!! To those interested, they have an Anniversary sale today so there's a [Silvertip badger fan](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/Nylon-hair-Resin-Handle-Shaving-Brush/32818154940.html?spm=a2g0s.9042311.0.0.722f4c4dPO79PE) for $21 and a [two-band fan](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/Light-purple-resin-handle-white-synthetic-hair-shaving-brushes-for-men/32814789061.html?spm=a2g0s.9042311.0.0.722f4c4dPO79PE) for $16!\n\nI cannot wait to see what the badger world is all about... talk about a rabbit hole within another rabbit hole.\n",

And the ice is from the menthol in the after shave balm. And roses and vetiver from the soap is what I would imagine Daenerys Targaryen would smell like. Right before she had a dragon crisp me for sniffing her...\n* **Soap:** CB has become the Poet of Vetiver in shaving. Besides this awesome floral vetiver mix, we have the vetiver as parchment effect in Revolution, the vetiver and coffee mix of Rud's Suds, and quite a few others. It is good that my favorite scent has found such a mighty champion, as, frankly, a lot of designers don't use it much, save as minor background effects.\n* **Frag:** A triumph in artisanal perfume design, FA continues to fascinate and amaze, with its complex evolution over time, and immensely long dry down. Appreciating things like this and JRFAT is bittersweet though; a man this talented is probably due for inevitable transition over into the pricey world of making fine parfums, where you can charge folks $50 an ounce for stuff without blinking an eye. Enjoy him while he's around, wet shaving dudes!",

GRRM almost certainly isn't releasing The Winds of Winter (though Robert Frost finished his [epic of fire and ice](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44263/fire-and-ice) many many many years ago). Also, it's the anniversary of the Three Mile Island meltdown. Oh, and tomorrow is the 8th anniversary of the publication of [The Marco Method](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44263/fire-and-ice)! Figured I'd drop that in today since I'll be traveling tomorrow and probably won't get to shave.\n\nI decided to give the Marco Method a go today and I don't think I have it quite down yet. I sure made a mess, but the lather was a little on the watery side, so I'm guessing I under-swirled. Whatever, still had a great cold shave with the Aussie Ice. Finished things off with a splash of Epsilon Blue, which I hear is a fair imitation of Floid Blue.\n\nGoing to be a busy day today with work and then getting the family to the airport for our midnight flight out. By tomorrow afternoon, we'll have arrived on a beautiful Caribbean beach where we will be spending the kids' spring break. Hopefully I'll at least make it to mid-day before I completely mentally check out of work.",

I don't have any dragon eggs yet so this is the best I could do.\n\nFor the fire I chose Nocturne due to its smoky forward. There's a real campfire scent off the puck that reminds me of the frequent camping I did around central Illinois as a kid. The sweetness of the apple comes out in the lather and I'm reminded of apple season at [Tanners Orchard ](https://www.tannersorchard.com/) . Campfires are a beautiful thing. I love the glowing embers, the pop and hiss of the wood, as well as the smell of the smoke which always seems to blow right in my face. One thing I hate about campfires is smelling them on my clothes later on. That's my biggest issue with Nocturne is I don't want to smell like that. Fortunately, I get to enjoy the memories whole shaving and the scent gradually fades away.\n\nFor the ice I chose the Stirling Glacial post shave balm. I use the unscented because I add it to whatever post shave I feel like and get the menthol without stepping on the fragrance. Slapping this stuff on after scrubbing with a boar brush brings a mentholated tear to my eyes.\n\nThis was a fun theme and a good challenge to take a matching photo. Now I can put Nocturne away until Fall.\n",

I used gear that he would have access to, or that typified him in some way. He was such a great guy. Carpenter, Army vet, tank mechanic, loving husband, humor that was out of this world, pro-level photographer, and involved in all kinds of \"helping hands\" types of charities. He will be sorely missed.\n\n#### ❧ Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Fatip - Grande - Nickel ::: Gillette - 7 o'clock - Blk ‹7 uses›)*\n\nsuper comfortable shave and great match of razor and blade for me.\n\nNo tugging or irritation.\n\n#### ❧ Soap Notes\n*^(Williams Mug Soap - Vintage Formula)*\n\nThe older formula of Williams has more tallow and easily compares, in terms of slickness, with any soap on the market. If you disagree, I would respectfully submit that you haven't lathered it right, yet. It won't have the post shave attributes of the top-tier soaps of today, but I don't care about that.\n\n40 second load with lightly-wet boar brush + Unknown Amount of water = 6-7 passes of super slick, creamy, amazing, slap-yo-mama lather.\n\nScent: old soap, so barely any. Just a little soapiness.\n\nScent Strength: 2/10, not really present during shaving.\n\nBowl - I used the XL version of this bowl:\nhttps://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3392930\n\n\n#### ❧ Brush Notes\n*^(Semogue - 2000 Boar ‹4 uses›)*\n\nThis guy is so comfortable. Big splay due to long bristles.\n\n#### ❧ Shave Quality\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Smooth\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Cut flush to where I just see the tips (above average for me)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm)\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

I really liked this method, but I underestimated how thirsty Icarus is and how little water my synthetic holds. Had to add water a few more times before it really hit that sweet spot. And when it hit, man was that lather ever good. Curious to see how my Parker silvertip does in this scenario.\n\nI got my start on Darkfall with the Icarus base and it was a game changer...every time I go back to that base, I'm still blown away. The only other base I'd hold in that conversation is the new A&E base, and that has more to do with not needing as much water to hit a similar level of protection and slickness. Excelsior is no slouch, but those are my top two.\n\nShave progressed beautifully. I've traditionally been a five-and-done razor blade kinda guy but id like to see how long I can push the PolSilvers.\n\nI'm still trying to dial in the mapping of my neck and jawline. It's the Wild West down there whereas my face can handle WTF, XTG, and ATG with no trouble. Ingrown hair central. It'll be one pass down there until the current ingrowns subside.\n\nI used the A&E Spartacus splash to compare the fragrances. I must say I prefer A&E to Sellout in that area. Executive Man is on the fresh and fruity side of the Creed spectrum, Sellout tones down the fruit and is almost all smoke and cologne...Spartacus sits firmly in the middle offering bright pineapple/citrus notes but with a strong cologne-y backbone and smoke that doesn't take over the scent. Caught whiffs of myself all evening and loved it.\n\n\nHave a great one, gang.",

Bay Rum production is currently halted follwing a down turn in West Indies Pimenta Racemosa \"Bay Leaf\" following Hurricane Maria in September of 2017. More staggering then the loss of Bay Leaf production, Maria would claim 3,057 lives and result in 91.6 billion dollars of damage. It's humbling then to shave with this Bay Rum because I can't do it without recognizing the history around it.\n\nGenerally, I'm not a fan of Bay Rum shaving soaps. It's hard to get the right mix of Bay, Rum and spice without it smelling overly spicy or sweet. Soaps that use actually Pimenta Racemosa seem to fair better then artificial extracts, the balance is solid and there is no chemical hints to the soap.\n\nWhite label was bloomed for a few mins while I took a shower. Soap was easily loaded into my SHD and I went for a face lather today. In the last ten days I've shaved with Excelsior, White Label, Reserve and Glissant. I've been able to try all four and they have all been great. Each one has some differences in strengths and weaknesses, but I feel like I can make out characteristics of each.\n\nLather was thick and might have been the thickest of the four besides Excelsior. Slickness was lowest of the four. Post shave moisture was tied with Glissant for 2/3rd place. I found the soap to be hard off the puck, scent was moderate in strength, rounded in scent and not sharp. It favored a lot of water. Post shave I did want some Aftershave. I elected for some MLS Drunken Goat. The only Bay Rum AS I have is captains choice and I don't care for it.\n\nIn other news, I thought I was working today, only to show up and realize I wasn't on the clock. I'm salary, so less hours don't bother me at all. I ran home and gave my wife some help with the kiddos. I also got a set of L&L Champs De Lavande with the Chatty Lux EdT in the mail today. I'm pretty excited about that. I like a good Lavender scent.\n\nHave a good Friday!\n\nRobot",

I haven't skipped that many days in at least a decade. A lot of people like to skip a day because the resulting shave is more gratifying after skipping a day or two. For me though, a daily shave is much more satisfying. Oh, yeah, today's shave was great, but I didn't like it more than a daily shave.\n\nI was talking to some friends about vetiver and it made me want to use a good vetiver soap today. This certainly qualifies. Straight Haitian vetiver with a hit of menthol. I am soooo glad I bought some vetiver soaps before the vetiver industry in Haiti was destroyed by the hurricane.\n\nEnjoy the day.",

Mostly cloudy, with a high near 53. Southwest wind 5 to 10 mph. New precipitation amounts of less than a tenth of an inch possible. High tide at 7:36 this evening.\n\n**Razor/Blade:** Switched the blade out this morning to see if it performed any better in the Timeless. While it did, it wasn't enough of an improvement to consider keeping it around. Shave was okay, but did manage to nick myself right above the chin.\n\n**Soap/Splash:** After people discussing APR's scents yesterday in the SOTD, felt like pulling out Passione today. It's a very nice scent, reminds me of Passiflora, if just a bit more tart. Performance is top notch, marco'd the lather and didn't have any issues, was nice and slick and protective. The splash seems a bit richer in scent, less tart than the soap.\n\n**Fragrance:** Got this sample when Biblio was released as a way to round out the order, and to hit the free shipping threshold. I wore it yesterday, and when I got home after working for 14 hours the wife asked what I was wearing and the fact that she liked it. It's a very nice frag, and will probably pick up a full bottle. It makes me wish I had gotten in on the Soap and Splash when it was around. Might post a WTB or WTT in the Bazaar for a set.\n\nHave a nice Friday everyone!",

It doesn't smell exactly like Spicebomb and I'm actually glad. Kaboom has more of a sweet and almost bit not quite fruity scent upfront that mellows out to spiciness whereas Spicebomb just hits with the spice early and doesn't ease up too much. Quality of lather is always pretty high up there with Stirling and I'm pleased with the overall shave. Happy Friday folks!",

I picked up my tub of TOBS and went to work. It wasn't the best shave, but it wasn't bad either. I love the smell and I find myself going back to it every once in a while. I do tend to overload when using it as well ( I may just be trying to get rid of it to justify a new soap purchase!) For my post I just went with some gold bond lotion. It works well enough but I'd really like to try an artisan balm and see what the difference is.\n\nAs for me, I'm still working on the new house. Yesterday I just finished installing door locks, but of course the last one had a factory defect. Today I'm installing a water softener and putting the finishing touches on the paint. After this I should be good but I'm sure my wife can find a project for me!\n\nHappy Friday everyone!",

Easy two pass DFS. Del Don smells like a sweeter / more floral Irish Tweed. Not unpleasant.\n\nI'm continuing to buy European things like it's going out of style (enjoying the benefits of the customs union for however much longer we are in it).\n\nToday's new European arrivals were the [Pereira Bowl](http://imgur.com/a/Txu77R6) and L'Occitan AS. Initial impressions of the bowl are very favourable. It's light, sturdy and a good size. The ridges helped produce a good lather with less time and effort. The brush holder is a good size.\n\nI *love* the scent of L'Occitan. The combination of lavender and black pepper is absolutely beautiful to me.",

My answer was TOBS Avocado. I'm guessing its been easily at least two years since I've used it (or any TOBS for that matter). Scent was great, but as expected, the performance was sub par. Lather that dried quickly offering little protection and practically no post shave goodness to speak of.\n\nIt was a nice walk down memory lane this morning, but I'm not sure the next time I'll be reaching for my TOBS.",

Listed scent notes are sage and lemon; magnolia and cedar; and a base of oakmoss, leather, and hay. I don't know what magnolia smells like, but I do know all those other notes... so if I had to take a guess, I'd say this smells like magnolia and hay... maybe a little sage? I didn't notice much else. It's quite pleasant and mild and the scent lingers on the face for a while post-shave (which surprised me considering how mild it was *during* the shave).\n\nShaving performance once again disappointed me. This soap wasn't slick enough for my taste. I'm going to shave with Cella over the weekend to re-establish a baseline of what a good soap should feel like, but I gotta say... Neither Noble Otter samples have satisfied me for performance. That makes me sad because I am, um, obsessed with how cute otters are. I really, really, really wanted to like this brand, but I just can't get a comfortable shave from these soaps.",

I wasn't expecting to like this release as much as I did since I'm not usually a big fan of heavily floral scents (and Tres Matres is definitely a floral scent). However, it's a very natural blending that isn't stuffy or cloying at all. Really nice:)",

Reminds me of a cross between how a Voskhod and a Crystal blade is...feels like its got one more shave on it and then it is toast, but none the less, I am impressed by its performance.

      "body": "Friday 3/29 SOTD\n\n* Razor: Karve CB B plate SB\n* Blade: Gillette 7:00 Yellow (1)\n* Soap: Wholly Kaw King of Bourbon double milk tallow base\n* Brush: 24mm Yaqi Moka Mew Brown synth\n* Post: Pacific Shaving Co's Caffeinated After Shave Balm\n* Frag: Lauren Polo Green EDT\n\nProduct Notes:\n\n* **Razor / Blade**: Decided to try the sharp Gillette Yellow in the Karve, Interesting result! The very sharp 7:00 normally gives a hellaciously harsh first shave and then mellows out. In the Karve, the Yellow gave a mild blade feel, much better than usual, ,,, but I got more along the lines of a DFS than a BBS after two passes. I am sure a third pass would have gotten everything smooth, but my 2019 resolution of two passes only is still in effect.\n* Upshot? I may have to rethink my thoughts on the efficiency of the Karve B plate. An ATT R1 or S1, the Blackbird, my CG L2. or any of my SEs would have easily given me a BBS with this blade in two passes... but would have felt a bit less pleasant in the process, to a varying degree. May be time to look at the C plate? In any case, the Karve feels smooth, looks great, and can give a 3 pass BBS as configured, and the option to try different plates just expands the versatility of a great and affordable razor.\n* **Soap:** So we are back to \"King\", After the first King and a Merchant, WK has apparently run out of impressive honorific titles for scent notes. Towards expanding the product line nomenclature, here are some suggestions for future efforts: \"God-Emperor of Jasmine\". \"Governor of Lavender\". \"Comptroller of Amber\". \"Assistant Vice President of Vetiver.\" No need to thank me!\n* More seriously, the new base rocks. The old WK tallow base was excellent, the DM addition increased performance a tad, and now at this point, the added bombs are just making the rubble bounce! The Buffalo base now runs neck in neck with Reserve and Eufros in my personal hierarchy of Bestest Soaps.\n* The scent design here is also great - sweet and pungent go hand in hand, and the vanilla and vetiver are finely balanced. My favorite WK scent since Fern Concerto!\n* **Brush:** A fine knot in an amazing handle. Yaqi offers a rare combo of brushes that are both cheap and interesting, as compared to the dull penalty box brushes that most companies offer at the sub-$50 price point.\n* **Frag:** Polo Green needs to go back into hibernation for the summer. It's green sharp woods and musk notes are as out of place in Spring weather as a down jacket. Still an amazing scent, but one that speaks of chill woods and icy lakes.\n\n​",

I'm just getting over a cold so couldn't really smell anything any way.\n\nThe lather was great - so easy to whip up and I was impressed by how nice the residual slickness and post shave feel is. I don't think I've given the soap proper trial time in the past.\n\nThe Voshkod blade has settled a bit (not as sharp anymore) and I find it makes for a nicer shave now. I think my technique / angle of razor might not be best for sharper blades like the Voshkod (of Feather).\n\nReally nice morning shave that has me feeling great this morning or maybe I'm just starting to recover from my cold..

I wonder if my lather was too thin and didn't offer as much protection as usual. And trying out SS Versailles for the first time.\n\n#### ❧ Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Timeless - Bronze .38 Solid Bar ::: Gillette - Silver Blue ‹23 uses›)*\n\nThis was a pretty good combo. It's not a young blade, and this is a somewhat mild razor, so maybe they are starting to not like each other that much. However, I know my lather was thinner than it should have been, so that could have been the issue.\n\nBut pass 2 and 3 went very well, and I ended up with a top-notch shave.\n\n#### ❧ Soap Notes\n*^(Soap Smooth - Versailles)*\n\nThem: \"Vetiver is a star in this blend with Frankincense and Black Pepper bringing out clean, fresh, and sophisticated.\"\n\n1/4- tsp soap + lightly-wet dense badger brush + 3.5 tsp water = 5-6 passes of slick, workable, but a bit thinner-than-I-like lather.\n\nScent: This is about the only use of Frankincense that I've come across that I like. It's not strong, and is a nice combo with the Vetiver. It's a subtle scent, but classy and warm and the vetiver and pepper seem to give it a bit of an edge, without being too thick.\n\nScent Strength: 4/10, lightly present during shaving.\n\nBowl - I used the XL version of this bowl:\nhttps://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3392930\n\n\n#### ❧ Brush Notes\n*^(Declaration Grooming - Carnavis and Richardson Rubberset 400 24mm ‹2 uses›)*\n\nwonderful big wall of soft badger. Splays nicely. No complaints.\n\n#### ❧ Shave Quality\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Cut flush to where I just see the tips (above average for me)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm)\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

The ingredients include Irish stout beer, goat milk, mutton tallow, duck fat, and beef tallow. This soap smells edible. I get mostly oatmeal initially and then some citrus and the sweetness of butterscotch. Once everything settles down there's some vanilla sets in to hold it all together. This is a soft soap and has a tan color which might be from the stout? I loaded too much like always and face lathered, adding water until it got creamy and slick. It gets white once lathered up and performs really well. Post shave is really really smooth. I was a little dry from too much soap but my skin was left as smooth as Reserve leaves me. I guess this base will only be released on special occasions so I'll be keeping an eye out for sure.\n\nToday was my first shave with the magic razor that I picked up after a suggestion from u/needsmorementhol. I cut a Feather blade in half and went to town. I kept saying \"wow\" during this shave. I really like this Shavette and the lather was really slick. I had no problems. I kept it WTG and finished with the Gem Junior which was also really fun. I might have two new favorite razors.\n\nI finished up with Summer Break Soaps Teacher's Pet splash. The apple pairs perfectly with the oatmeal of the soap and I honestly can't get enough of this Macintosh apple scent.\n\nHave a great weekend!",

      "body": "[SOTD 30th of March, 2019 \"Drunken Goat\"](https://i.imgur.com/y6rHFxX.jpg)\n\n- Razor: Karve B\n- Blade: Astra\n- Soap: Mickey Lee Soapworks \"Drunken Goat\"\n- Brush: That Darn Rob \"Pueblo\" w/ 26MM SHD\n- Aftershave: Mickey Lee Soapworks \"Drunken Goat\"\n\nSometimes I get these crazy ideas and then I just follow them through the logical conclusion. I got Drunken Goat in a trade with Latherhog from Instagram. I remember at the time thinking to myself how the hell my going to make a photo work. Also in the state of California it is illegal to get a goat drunk (fun fact).\n\nSo as I was thinking about alternate ideas I was listening to some classic music from the 90s, you know, Nirvana, Jane's Addiction, Stone Temple Pilots and then [\"I'm Shipping Up to Boston\"](https://youtu.be/x-64CaD8GXw) came on by Dropkick Murphys. \"Drunken Goat\" I thought, huh that kinda of sounds like a Punk Band and then I ran with the idea (/u/templlama44 thanks for letting me bounce ideas off you for this one).\n\nThis is the first soap I've had by MLS and I actually wanted to get it following the AMA with Brad from Maggards. During the AMA I asked him his top five soaps that he would recommend to somebody getting into wetshaving and Drunken Goat made that list. The rest of the soaps named we're already ones I like so it felt like it was a safe bet of the time and he was absolutely right.\n\nIn hindsight, I was a bit aggressive with my water. I could've done a better job shaking out my brush and I didn't develop a good lather until the second pass. I don't consider that any fault of the soap because the second and third passes were fantastic. The Karve continues to do great work. I see other razors out there like a Pils, CG or Wolfman and I don't know if I can justify a purchase like that when I am so happy with the Karve right now. I feel like I'm good on razors for the next six months, but again, you never know.\n\nI suppose I should talk about the scent a little bit. Drunken Goat smells like a stout infused cookie. It is a gourmet style soap and my wife enjoyed the smell although she did feel that it was closer to a autumn scent. I had a tester of the aftershave and so I finished up with the matching pair. I think it smells great, my face feels good, and this was a soap that will stay in my collection.\n\nIn other news, I will be waking my family up in a couple of hours and driving them to the airport. I made a promise to my wife that after we moved to California, I would make sure that she would be able to see her family on a regular basis. A couple of times a year she will take the kids and stay in Texas for two or three weeks with her parents and give the kids a chance to play in planes and fields and smell some bluebonnets. It's also a chance for my wife to get some bluebell ice cream. I'm not kidding when I say that we stock up on all of the good food from H-E-B we can and then she flys it back.\n\nHave a good Saturday Y'all.\nRobot",

Second shave with this soap, didn't click with the base my 1st go, but had zero issues this time. Finally getting to the point where I feel you could hand me any base and I could confidently produce a great lather with no issues!\n\nI have also decided that I do like silver blues better than Astras after all.\n\n\nEdit: does anyone know how to make reddit bold just one word, not a whole line?",

I had a soap picked out, then another, then another, then it occurred to me to go back to this soap sample. This scent has never wowed me. But it wasn't offensive either. A funny thing happened today. While the scent still doesn't blow me away, it seemed to grow on me a bit. It quite enough to warrant a full tub, but it could happen by the time I'm done with this sample. Stranger things have happened.\n\nBust day lies ahead.",

Otherwise, mostly cloudy, with a high near 45. Northeast wind around 5 mph becoming southeast in the afternoon. High tide at 8:36 tonight.\n\n**Razor/Blade:** Used the same blade as yesterday and it finalized my decision to bin it. Razor performed great, but the blade detracted from the experience, just rough.\n\n**Soap:** Performance on the soap is very nice, can't wait to see how the new base performs. The soap scent seems to have faded, and I mostly get the scent of the soap itself, maybe there is a hint of scent left, but not much.\n\n**Splash:** The splash still smells wonderfully. Like I remember playing outside in the spring to smell like. Performance is nice.\n\nHave a nice Saturday everyone!",

My newly acquired Port au Price was calling my name - I can't believe it took me 45 years to discover vetiver but I like it ... a lot, and this soap delivers.\n\nI severely overloaded, and after my traditional 4 passes, just kept lathering up and rinsing off to see how many shave-worthy passes I could get. I stopped counting at 9. Who says face lathering is hard ;-)\n\nLike /u/CosmoBarber, I used my Spilo Magic clone. The sound this razor makes always puts a smile on my face, and Cosmo proved yet again that you don't need to be an \"expert\" to shave with this \"bloodthirsty nape shaver\". He's rolling in dough, so he bought the $10 Master Barber clone, while mine only cost me $2 (shipped) from AliExpress.",

My tub of FitD has definitely seen better days. I think I waited too long to shave it down and press it down into the tub. I'm getting small pieces of the soap stuck in my brush that ends up making massive amounts of lather, probably too much. But I washed my whole face with the leftover lather, so I don't think it's a waste lol. I'm gonna miss it when it's gone, but I'm excited to keep working toward pulling out my Reserve Lavender set. Now I'll need to decide on which set to focus on killing next. I've enjoyed using FitD every other day and I'd like to continue that tradition until I kill my next set. I'll just hafta decide which is next, and that's HARD.",

Slickness was better, both primary and especially residual. Post-shave feel was about the same. Got a much closer shave out of it too. That settles it for me: Siliski, Mickey Lee, and Noble Otter don't work for me (for whatever reason, possibly my hard/alkaline tap water).\n\nThe Shark is starting to fade a bit. Short lived blades.

It will be interesting to compare the performance of the fanchurian to the shd. My guess is the fanchurian might splay a bit more abd be a bit softer, but we shall see.\n\nShave was a bit tuggy yesterday, so I wonder if the blade was the culprit. If it starts like that again, I'll be binning it mid shave.\n\nHappy Saturday!\n\n",

Also wanted to use some Otter and love the Lonestar scent!\n\n#### ❧ Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Timeless - Bronze .38 Solid Bar ::: Gillette - Silver Blue ‹24 uses›)*\n\nguys who are obsessed with the feel of a sharp, new blade, that slices through hairs like butter ... won't like this shave. But for those of us who can tolerate the next step down, where the hairs still get cut very nicely, and there's no irritation... then this one was just fine.\n\nNice close cut, and as always, especially good on pass 2 and 3.\n\n#### ❧ Soap Notes\n*^(Noble Otter - Lonestar)*\n\nLonestar has a great scent! Manly and well-mixed with good notes. I could easily see wearing this as an EDT.\n\nTheir base is top notch. Creamy and slick.\n\nTub-Loading: 30 sec load with lightly wet boar brush + 2 tsp water = perfect amount and consistency for me. Used soft water and 2.5 tsp water worked, too.\n\nScooping: 1/4- tsp of soap + 2.5 tsp water made a great lather, and just the right amount for 3.5 passes, using my Romero Manchurian brush.\n\nScent Strength: 5/10 IIRC. Nicely available during shave, but not obtrusive.\n\n\n#### ❧ Brush Notes\n*^(Stirling - Boar 24mm Factory Seconds ‹11 uses›)*\n\nFairly smooth. Kinda massage-ey. Still lots of backbone. Enjoyable to use. Didn't shave last night, like I planned, so the brush soaked for several hours instead of just 1-2. Didn't seem to change it too much. I like this brush.\n\n#### ❧ Shave Quality\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Cut flush to where I just see the tips (above average for me)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm)\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nEdit: Added video link",

I'll try to remedy that with the next shave :). I'm adding Druantia to the list of scents that I want to pick up a set of in the future. I ended up overwatering my lather and had to load some more soap. Sometimes I do this on purpose, but in this case I had started out too dry and then went too much in the other direction. Easy enough to fix...just loaded more soap. The description says woodsy and spicy, and that's a pretty accurate description. The scent is really well done.\n\nI haven't tried all of the knots in this price range, but the SHD knots are some of the nicest I've tried for ones that are mass-produced. This one is very soft to the touch, and has a nice balance of presence and softness during the shave. It's not as nice as the hand-tied knots I've had, and it's not fair to expect that.\n\nI'll be enjoying the salves until I've used up my stash. That might take a while :). I might consider picking up some more when I run out, whenever that is.",

High praise for a Chatillon Lux fragrance that has been been transposed into T+S, Wholly Kaw and Declaration Grooming soap bases. While I cannot find the exact quote I believe /u/Hawns has previously said that YRP is one of his most popular fragrances, and I believe it.\n\nYRP consists of a simple, three note fragrance: Yuzu, Rose and Patchouli. That is not to say that the scent is anything from simple however, it is remarkably well balanced. The yuzu is bright, sharp and fresh. The rose balances out the citrus notes and provides floral midnotes. The patchouli is, to my nose used sparingly and acts as a base that ties in the rose and yuzu together for a herbaceous earthiness.\n\nThe Declaration soap base for the YRP collaboration is the bison tallow base and makes for a beautiful, thick lather that is moderately thirsty and can survive a lot of water. I shaved with three passes using my Karve for a very smooth and relaxing shave.\n\nI think there's something to be said about a fragrance which not one, two but three well regarded soap manufacturers agree to collaborate on over the course of the fragrances life. To me, that speaks volumes about it. I see YRP as a perfect summer soap. It's bright, citrus sharp, fresh and clean.\n\nPost shave I finished up with the matching Chatillon Lux aftershave. Initially with a dry face I found of the aftershave scent was extremely potent. One of my friends than recommended trying to apply the AS while my face was still wet, as he felt that the water helped balance the aftershave. After trying it both ways I would agree with him and recommend that anyone in the future also apply aftershave why your face is still damp. Also a big thanks to /u/matty21wtx for selling me this soap. Its been a pleasure to shave with. He made the transaction very easy and I would recommend buying from him in the future.\n\nIn other news, my family is now in Texas and I am making preparations to go to LA next week for a work trip. I have some bacon in the oven right now and I'm getting ready to make a BLT. I just watched three hours of Umbrella Academy. What an awesome show! I also slept for 10 hours. It's like I'm a bachelor again with just me and my dog. I also have to finish cleaning up the house. I'm kind of OCD and I know that once I get the house clean I'll be able to keep it clean spotless until my family gets back. I don't know about y'all but as a parent it is so difficult to keep your house clean. My one year-old is into everything and it feels like a constant struggle to keep up with his busyness.\n\nMy wife sent me pictures earlier this evening of my kids playing in a big field, getting dirty with their grandpa. I'm glad for a few weeks out of the year I can get them out to California. Hopefully a little bit of Texas rubs off on them.\n\nY'all have a good Sunday.\nRobot",

Not as powerful as Cryogen, but plenty of that menthol feel nonetheless. Excellent lathering performance.\n\nHope everyone is having a great weekend!",

I not sure exactly, still going from yesterday after a long and crazy night. A nice shave and shower was just the ticket to relaxing my mind.\nI bought this razor to use when traveling. The test run today went smoothly, but I did miss my Rockwell 6S, weight makes a yuge difference. The soap was predictably great. The calming scent of The Trail matches the damp spring weather around here. Noble Otter continues to be one of my favorite artisans, their soap is ajoy to lather and leaves my skin feeling well hydrated. I have only tried the Trail and BarrBarr from N.O., but want to sample Monarch and Noir et Vanille, hopefully soon.",

I had a good enough XTG that I decided to try the ATG with the straight. All in all, while it's not as smooth of a shave with a DE, mostly around the jaw and mouth, it was still good. Only blemish on the shave was the cut I suffered on my upper lip, so there's no hiding that from the public. I really struggled up there on that pass that I skipped it entirely once I cut myself. Damn hairs just didn't want to get cut. Some irritation marks on my neck exposed themselves after the alum pass, but no blood down there.\n\nLife is short, shave with good gear.\n",

In a lot of ways, not a good shave. I don't know if it was not getting the hang of the shave angle, or the typical Gillette first-shave blues, but I couldn't get in as close as I like in two passes. Figure I'll repeat tomorrow and see if breaking in the blade makes a difference.\n\nA/S was new from Amazon; something about those big 400mL bottles gets to me. Nice menthol kick; smell is kind of hard to place but nice.Followed up with a couple spritzes of Terre D'Hermes.",

The aftershave is awesome, it's more moisturizing than any post shave product I've ever used. The scent is pretty light, to the point I didn't realize what the hype was about the scent. It felt amazing on my skin though. The Cade cologne is where the scent really shines. I absolutely love it, it's got a sweet woodsy powdery note that I can still smell this morning.

I mean, it was $1.23, inclusive of shipping. That sounds like a high quality item, right? It was late, maybe I had a few drinks, I don't know. It showed up a few weeks ago and the construction is exactly as you would expect, so I shoved it in a closet and forgot about it. After seeing /u/NeedsMoreMenthol also must have mentioned it to /u/CosmoBarber, and /u/CosmoBarber actually used something similar yesterday, I remembered I had it so I took it out this morning....Both /u/templlama44 and /u/Not_A_Robot_101 warned me not to do it, but I snapped and went to load a blade anyway this morning...The thing is so cheap, I couldn't even get the blade to line up properly, and cut my finger. I figured that was enough for one day, and set it aside and lathered up. But after lathering up, curiosity got the better of me....I did a few swipes down one cheek. It was rough. It was like shaving with a pair of opened kid scissors or something. Well, what that's probably like. I dunno how you guys do it :)\n\nTL;DR: Buy cheap chinese razor, get exactly what you paid for.",

The inaugural shave with it will be so satisfying. I've used shavettes before, but I don't own one at the moment so I thought it would be a great purchase.\n\nAnyway, I freaking love spicebomb, it's pretty much everything I look for in a fragrance, it's masculine but not too masculine. Pre de Provence's no. 63 is a dead ringer for the scent of spicebomb extreme and waaay cheaper so I had to buy it. Idk if they were trying to make it smell like spicebomb extreme, but they did an awesome job. I spray around 12-14 sprays all over myself I love this stuff much. I spray that much just to make sure I can smell it on me through out the day. I should get a travel atomizer for it to keep reapplying as the day goes on.",
