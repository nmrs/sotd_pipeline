So I slept late and did the same shave I've been doing for two weeks.\n\nI have been having trouble getting a good shave during this trip. I would think it is the fault of the Arko but when I was test driving it at home I felt it performed well enough. Maybe there's different water hardness here or something.\n\nOh well.

I still can't get easy lather out of the Stirling finest for the life of me. I used MdC just to ensure that I'd have an easier time building lather and made damn sure that I loaded long enough (a whole fucking minute!), yet on the third pass I still had to squeeze the brush to get the lather out. What. The. Fuck. Are badgers just not for me? The fan also feels unpleasantly huge on my face, which isn't great. The brush is super soft and the backbone feel made me realize why people say synthetics feel soulless, but I might have to sell the brush if this keeps on. I pulled the trigger on the 23mm Muhle STF v2 in frustration. Nothing like a ragebuy I guess.\n\nMdC is slick while shaving, but man does it make my face feel awful. I'm pretty sure I had a good shave and used very little pressure since alum gave very little burning, but after using Nivea and Lucky Tiger my skin still felt super dry. This is the first time I've used Lucky Tiger Face Tonic. It smelled great but didn't really do anything to help my skin be less dry.

I loved this one as soon as I sniffed it. Of all the new soaps that have piled up, I couldn't wait for Lather Games to wrap up so I could dig in to this one. Worn leather is the first note I noticed, and the strongest anchor scent, but it's not dominating. Blowing around it is a strong salty sea breeze and the many years of gunpowder smoke that has embedded itself into that leather. Underneath all of that is a woody base, and the light sweetness of rum. Looking through the scent notes and descriptions, one might come to the conclusion that it's a very heavy scent, maybe something appropriate for the fall, but it's not. The woods and salty aquatic notes give it something that is also fresh. This one will work year round. Good stuff. Well done /u/fahrenheit915,\n\nThis is only the third lather with this Semogue. I did one defunking lather just to clean out any gunk, then went straight into using it for the last shave of Lather Games. I figure I'll break this one in the old fashioned way, by just using it. So far it's already feeling great. Unlike the Omega's, which were quite harsh before breaking in, this one has a mid scrub and just the tiniest scritch. I've actually enjoyed it the last couple of days. My biggest concern is that it may be too floppy once it fully breaks in. Also, it's still eating the lather enough that the third pass is a little thin. The general wisdom I've discerned from reading appears to suggest this will go away and it will start leaving enough for a full three passes.",

The games are over. Whew.\n\nI've said it before, and I'll say it again: **HOOK HYPE!** This soap's performance is what I've come to expect from /u/fahrenheit915 after his previous two outings, which is to say excellent. The scent is very good as well. I'm a bit stuffy this week, so mostly what I'm getting from it is leather with a hint of gunpowder, which ain't too bad in my story book. Great work on this release, dude.\n\nThere's no mistaking that this Astra blade is slowing down. It did well yesterday in my V3A, but today it felt like I needed to do extra touch-ups. I'm going to give it 3 more shaves and then reevaluate, but I have a feeling that it's going to take up residence in my blade bank very soon.\n\nEnjoy your Saturday, all. I'ma go hang with my kiddo.",

I absolutely love the glissant formula and never really considered buying the reserve. That consideration went out the window with this shave, what an amazing lather! I threw this soap in my maggards cart already. I got really stiff egg white peaks and amazing glide. Wasn't quite BBS but definitely a DFS. The addition of menthol to the aftershave added a nice cooling touch. The Bleu de Chanel really compliments the fragrance.",

After a long day at work, I decided to wind down with some Lavanille. I figured that Elysium would get close to the lavender/vanilla combo on Lavanille, but these scents are very different.

Shaving around a jawline beard for the first time was a bit anxiety inducing, but I seemed to do alright.\n\nI couldn't tell if it was the soap or the blade, but I didn't feel the blade on my face at all which was sort of nice. Sort of meh on the scent but the post shave feel was awesome.\n\nI'm trying to put together what the scents that I like and dislike have in common, but I'm having difficulty as they don't seem to have much in common. The dislike pile includes Summer Storm, After the Rain, Stirling Tuscany and Mountain Man, and Jurate. These were all scents I was sure I was going to like. The like pile includes Lavanille, CF Santa Paula, CF Midnight Stag, CF Sherlock, CB QCV, and CB La Piment de Vie.",

CRSW is a terrific soap and offers top-notch performance. Also figured I dust off my 1912 and give it a whirl. Love the shave it gives, but still get bent shaving under my beak. I do go sideways, but no matter what razor, I don't go ATG under my nose. No matter how many times I've tried, I will always get some sort of weeper and irritation.

I had a bit of an easier time building the lather today, as I started with a wetter brush. Still took quite a bit of elbow grease though. Next time I might try with a sopping wet brush and see how that goes.\n\nThe Barrister's Reserve aftershaves are probably the best I've tried in terms of skin conditioning. The only other aftershaves that are in the same league for me are the Chatillon Lux splashes. Don't get me wrong, others are good, but these two are just so luxurious without feeling too heavy on the face. Top...fucking..notch.\n\nAlso trying out something I saw on a recent thread either here or on /r/wicked_edge. Did 2 WTG passes on my neck instead of trying to do any XTG or ATG. Hoping it will give me a passably close shave without irritation.\n\nHave a good day folks!",

Scent off the puck reminds me of new car smell. My nose is weird. The Gunpowder and Salt Water is all I get. The notes didn't change much through the lather. I don't care too much for the stirling badger. Yes it's got the cloud/gel tips but I feel it's a little too dense. Got this little vintage razor to match my birth year. A little too mild for my tastes but a fun little razor for the collection. The splash was great. I get more of the wood scents and something sweet. I'm glad I got the set because it really puts it all together for my nose. Anyways now to prepare my F5 button for Tishomingo.",

The new blade seems to have helped, but this still wasn't the best shave I've had with these samples. Either I still need to dial in the lather on this one, or my technique is still inconsistent. Or maybe the Tobacco & Coffee sample base works better for me?\nRegardless, the soap was still quite good. The Lavanille splash didn't so much pair with it as completely overwhelm it, but that was expected, given the weak scent.",

I had thought about MdC Agrumes for today, but decided it's best to get this to /u/Eric--m so he can let /u/chill31613 give it a go lol it's an excellent soap! I just kept adding more and more water and it just got better and better! I'm definitely getting a set if I can find the splash, and the soap if that's all I can find =)\nI'm SO STOKED on this Declaration Nebula! It's so different from Prime and B2! This was its maiden voyage, so I know it will evolve a bit. I can't really say what the difference is *new* between the batches, because the other Declarations I own have all been second hand. In fact, almost all of my brushes have been second hand heh. It's scrubby, but not uncomfortable by any means (and I think he means by previous batches of his hair lol) It's nothing remotely close to my M&F 3XL Blond, THAT THING IS A SCRUBBY BEAST!!! I look forward to using this and feeling the evolution!\nI used this aftershave a few days ago because I just couldn't wait to try the scent out, and I could still adhere to the days theme lol. This is really nice stuff! The scent is a nice mellow lavender. The description says coffin wood and ozone too lol, but it's mostly lavender with an ever so slight woodiness that mellows everything out. I'll grab a bottle if I can source one =)\n\nHappy Canada Day to all the Canadians out there!\nAnd happy Saturday to the non Canadians =P\n\nEdit: 31/30 days completed =P\n31 unique soaps",

Left side of the face with the brass, right side with the Aluminium.\n\nThe Aluminium is more nimble and easier to control as you would imagine however the Brass seems to be just a touch smoother. Whether that was down to the blade already having a couple of uses on it I'm not sure. Otherwise the shave feels very similar on both sides so really the verdict can only come down to the ease of use and in this case the Aluminium wins.\n\nThe Brass is very nice however and should one become available at a good price I'd probably pick it up and try and find a different handle.\n\nJust received a Rocnel SE-G in another passaround so that's up next. Blackbird, I promise I'll give you the attention you deserve soon.",

High tide at 7:22 tonight.\n\nI had been wanting to get a custom brush made for some time and once I saw that /u/g_huck had gotten in some green malachite rod stock in I knew it was time. After some back and forth about the handle shape nailed it down to a take on a [Rubberset 400](http://imgur.com/d6O0wJz) [(no flutes)](http://imgur.com/a/d58ZZ). When we got talking about knots I mentioned that I was looking to eventually get a Declaration knot. He suggested that I could have him ship the handle directly to Scott with Wave 2 of the Hucklaration Collab. I got in touch with Scott, and he graciously agreed to do a knot for it, even though it technically wasn't part of the Hucklarations, and I hadn't purchased the Knotting service. The handle came out great, and so far is my favorite. The knot is a Wall of Badger, and makes me wish I got in on the Declaration knots before B3.\n\ntl;dr: Comissioned a handle from g_huck, sent out to Scott for knotting, and everything is so much better than I could have even expected.\n\nHave a nice Sunday!",

I was a little skeptical of all the hype, but it seems to be warranted. The puck is firmer, but as soon as loading starts, it develops that stringy gooey texture much like L & L and Storybook soaps. Super slick and a good post shave feel. I guess after using SoA, I was expecting more of a lateral move in quality over the normal soap base, but this was a step forward from Glissant and White Label.\n\nI also managed to get a full 3 passes worth of lather out of the Semogue. Just barely, but it was enough. I'm enjoying breaking this one in.\n\n\n\nHave a good one.",

That said, I did enjoy the feeling of the menthol, and it didn't linger much after I rinsed it off.\n\nThe scent was pleasant enough, though more chill than lemon to my nose, and a sweeter lemon at that.\n\nFourth & Pine, at first whiff, smells just like Sprite to me. If I investigate a little bit closer, I pick up some grapefruit and maybe some woodiness as well.",

      "body": "Burning through samples this week\n\n* Pre: shower, noxzema\n* Brush: Omega 49 boar\n* Lather: Mickey Lee's Grand Havana\n* Razor: Maggard's Open Comb, MR7 handle\n* Blade: Polsilver Super Iridium\n* Post: Chatillon Lux's Unconditional Surrender toner\n* Frag: Guerlain's Vetiver\n\nTobacco theme today. Great soap. Performs well, and an excellent scent. The tobacco is subtle, and I like that. I like scents where the tobacco is a complex background note. I might buy this!\n\nI like the Unconditional Surrender drydown, but the initial blast of leather, tobacco, and oud is a little intense. It's very enjoyable after about 10 minutes when the tonka starts coming out. I might save this toner for cooler weather.\n\nSamples I went through this week:\n\n* Stirling's Grapefruit with Menthol. Weak grapefruit and little-to-no menthol. The grapefruit came across as \"woody\" rather than fresh citrus to me. Performed well just like all Stirling's, but the scent just wasn't there for me. Too bad, I was super excited for this soap; I love grapefruit and bitter citrus in general.\n* Stirling's Glastonbury: Another Stirling soap I thought I would like based on the description, because I love patchouli. Was merely okay to my nose. Not in love with it; made me wish I was lathering Fine's American blend instead.\n* Chiseled Face's Ghost Town Barber: amazing scent, great performance. Just irritated my face a bit. Real shame about the irritation, would have been a \"buy\" otherwise.",

It's much softer than the regular line from this artisan. The Premium base is a big improvement. It took me a little longer than normal to get it dialed indie to my unfamiliarity with it. This is some slick friggin soap. I under loaded and just for science I used a very thin lather for my third and fourth passes. Plenty of residual slickness. This soap is moving up in heavy rotation.\n\nI think I may have found a razor that beats all other vintage DE razors that I own. The NEW Deluxe is just crazy efficient.

It's a dark and rainy day today so I was in the mood for a nice darker scent so chose some Vetiver based scents. Put a fresh Feather blade in and did a quick one pass shave, it did a great job. Didn't have much stubble to begin with today so didn't feel the need for anymore.\n\nCL - LQV is such a strong scent, I love it. Even the scent from the salve stays with me for hours.",

Performance was quite good, although B&M soaps for me are always about scents as the performance I suppose is tuned to more general audience.\n\nThe reserve line of aftershave however is the next best thing after sliced bread! I wish there was a scent that absolutely love (may be it will be Fern)!\n\nThird shave with my own edge.

Today's a weird day in which a balance of good and sucky things are affecting my mood, and I literally don't know how to feel.\n\nBut fuck that, too: I won the lather games and I'm still tickled about that. *Bon Vivant* is an awesome scent, and Scoot's bison tallow puts the *slick* in residual slickness. I'm at work basically alone today so that means I can get a bunch of stuff done without being bothered too much. It's gonna be a good day.\n\nEnjoy your Monday, everyone!",

Long story short in my sleep induced insomnia I told him I could take care of the problem. At least I solved their issue in 2 hours so I don't have to keep dealing with it today.\n\nAs for the shave, I couldn't figure out what soap I wanted to use. Suddenly it hit me, all of the lather games I never used Dr. Jon's Hydra which is my favorite Citrus scent (when I wanted something bright). Great shave and I hope everyone enjoys today and hopefully a day off tomorrow.",

I have jury duty today and am sitting here bored out of my mind. Why have someone report for jury duty the day before a holiday? In all honesty, I wouldn't mind getting picked except I will either have to go unpaid or burn my vacation. The piddly amount they pay jurors is ridiculous and so people like me sit here hoping to be dismissed instead of trying to do our civic duty. The people that can do jury duty without being seriously financially punished is small. I guess grumbling won't change anything. At least I got a great shave this morning and smell even better.

This stuff is even smokier when lathered! Smoke and root beer. I'm sure there's other stuff going on, but those were the heaviest notes my nose picked up. It was nice but decided to spare my wife from the scent. So I finished the shave with the Dark splash.",

Stumbled across a local shop called the \"Soap Cellar\". Had to go in and see what was going on right?! Long story short, he makes bath soaps with essential oils for aromatherapy style soaps. He did make one shave soap bar, which he swore by. Said it eliminated all irritation, so of course I got to try it! Add it to the unique part of the shave den. Performance was ok.. dried up too fast. Menthol was weak compared to what we are used to. Peppermint smell was good! Post shave was comfortable, but not amazing. Overall it was a cool experience to get my first local soap here, but it'll probably just be my pre/post shave bar from now on.",

Pretty fun surf. We had a pod of baby dolphins playing about 20' from us in the lineup. This is a pretty posh area and it's normal to have guys pulling surfboards out of their BMWs and Porsches. Lots of smokin hot women with plastic surgery and perfect figures. We were drinking Bloody Marys at a cafe afterwards and saw some poor dude minding his own business, sitting at a bus stop, get [swarmed by coppers] (http://i.imgur.com/bPvlOtG.jpg). Four squad cars. No idea what he did but we suspect he was arrested for not making six figures. LoL.\n\nSo today I used Hook, courtesy of /u/chill31613. Thanks good buddy!!! I had some burning with Elysium, but no issues with Hook. Awesome shave and my skin feels great on the post shave. I got about 90% leather and 10% ocean/gunpowder. I really liked it. I had to use bay rum after this shave and it's working so nice. I'm loving it. My CG DC has been producing some brilliant shaves recently. Level 2 is the cat's ass!\n\nEDIT: Hook is now ordered! :D\n\nSong of the Day: [Cat Stevens \"If You Want To Sing Out\"] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTHvfHCri98)",

I was not disappointed! The performance is exactly as I expected, and the scent is fantastic! This is a lemony citrus blend with some orange goodness to back it up. My nose isn't as knowledgeable as many here, so I can't pick out the specifics, but those are the notes I pick up =)\nThis razor was recently gifted to me by /u/tiglathpilesar, and I love it! Maybe a year or so ago, he sponsored a passaround consisting of an Old Type thin cap, a #66, and an open comb variety I don't recall the number of. What I do remember is being surprised at just how aggy/efficient this #66 razor is! I have a red tip and don't use it a whole lot because it's just too mild for my liking, regardless if is considered one of their more aggy razors. I also have a Fat Boy that I need to crank up to 9 =P\nThis #66 is right up my alley for what I enjoy shaving with! Thanks again Tig!!!\nSecond use of this Nebula B3, and I absolutely LOVE it thus far! It's scrubby, but I can feel it softening ever so slightly. According to Scott, he suggests it should take approximately 15 shaves before it really starts to shine, and I'm loving it already!\n\nHappy shaving everyone!",

I thought I'd celebrate by using my B3 Nebula Jefferson for the first time. First of all, the colors on this handle are insane.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/7dPhqqv.jpg\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/eiWURKP.jpg\n\nI shampooed it last night, and the knot has opened up a bit. It's very well proportioned and dense! The backbone is definitely there compared to B1 and B2. Splay was great. No scritch, but plenty of scrub. The tips are not as soft as B1 or B2, but were still very good and should only soften up as the brush breaks in. Unlike B1 and B2, which needed no break in, this brush will need some time (which I'm very cool with). This will be a good compliment to my other Declarations, and will be a dedicated triple milled soap killer! LoL\n\nI tested a soap prototype today. I'll save the majority of my feedback for the developer. The lather was thin and aerated, despite all my attempts to get a nice thick, protective lather. Slickness was good, so with a little care I had a very nice shave. The soap needs some further work, though. The scent was also very neutral - I like strong, invigorating scents so that was a minus for me. I think it's great all these new folks developing soaps. We're in the golden era of wetshaving!\n\nKeeping the Bay Rum train going with Dominica!!\n\nSong of the Day: [The Rolling Stones \"Paint It Black\"] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InRDF_0lfHk) with some good Vietnam War footage.

Cape Verde is such a great scent, especially on the sunny and hot days. I like how he citrus notes are more like a zest or peel of an orange/lemon than the actual fruit itself. Changes things up a bit. The lavender and powdery note work well together too. The Polsilver has felt a slight rough at times today and yesterday but that'll probably smooth itself out.

I'll be shaving with a sample at least 5 days out of the week - weekdays to make it easier to remember. Not counting Stirling samples in this just yet, as I have so dang many of them and they take forever to go through.\n\nLavanda should have one more shave left on it. The Latha soaps build a lather with incredible ease and quickness.\n\nFirst time trying this blade. Initial impressions are mixed. First pass was quite tuggy, especially in areas of thicker growth. After that though, it felt very smooth. Overall, it was quite comfortable, but a bit inefficient. I did a full four passes, and was left with almost no irritation, but also not a BBS shave. Definitely DFS though. We'll see how I like it in the next few shaves.\n",

      "body": "Happy America Day! I decided to celebrate with a soap possibly made in the Netherlands, and a patchoulli theme.\n\n* Prep: Shower, Noxzema\n* Brush: Omega 49\n* Lather: Fine Accouterments' American Blend\n* Razor: Merkur 37c\n* Blade: Derby Extra\n* Post: Alum, Fine's American Blend aftershave, Chatillon Lux's Yuzu/Rose/Patchouli salve.\n* Frag: Davidoff's Zino\n\nFine's American Blend is one of my favorite soaps. There is something extra satisfying about making a lather from a hard puck. The lather is excellent, easy to form, slick, and has a robust scent. I get mostly exotic woods, patchouli and other herbs out of it. Honestly, the scent makes more of an impression on me than my memories of the original Rive Gauche; I recall Rive Gauche being a little more polite and I like the slightly rough edges of this soap.\n\nAftershave is excellent too, although I like partnering it with something that has more of a barrier component, like today's salve. I'm thinking of adding a little glycerin to it to try and make it a little more soothing. Scent matches the soap well.\n\nI think that I'm going to start working my way through the Fine catalog once some extra \"soap slots\" open up. Curious about getting the AoS Sandalwood scent in a soap that doesn't irritate my skin.\n\nToday's fragrance is Zino, which pairs well with the soap and aftershave. It's also exotic wood and patchouli scent, but has a stronger floral component. One of my favorites.",

Still, I'd say 7/10 times I'm gonna tell you it's *Catalan's Prairie.* I've been waiting for like a year for this to become a soap, and I never even realized I wanted that until I heard about the anniversary thing that Shawn and Scoot were doing. Thank you, /u/hawns, for making this poor, lonely kid's dreams come true.\n\nSo here you have it, folks: [This is what a blade with 120 shaves on it looks like.](http://imgur.com/a/FJzHM)\n\n/u/mradamlerner, here's my final check-in to the longevity challenge. I'm retiring this guy today. If I had to guess, I'd say that the blade probably has a good 10 shaves left in it, but much like a beloved pet, I don't want its last day to be its worst day, so into the blade bank it goes. It ended its tenure in the same razor it started.\n\nEnjoy your 'Murica day, everyone. I'm spending mine alone, so I'll probably be drinking whiskey on my balcony instead of cleaning my apartment.\n",

There are one or two small spots that aren't 100% perfect, but this is the first shave I've had that I feel comfortable calling BBS. That required a 4 pass shave and a whole lot of touchups (using the spare lather I keep in my goatee).\n\nGiven the repeated scraping of my face, I was pleasantly surprised that the AS hardly burned at all. The CF splash tends to burn more than some of my other splashes, so if I had messed up my skin, it would have let me know.\n\nNow if only I could do this in fewer passes, or without a ton of buffing. Maybe I should try a less mild razor.",

Its corners seem to catch much like the 1st gen blackbird seemed to.

Do find the post shave a bit drying, but will try to combat that with since mood water next time. The scent it's fantastic, while Tuscany isn't a perfect match, it will do until I can get some samples to try with it.\n\nHave a nice Wednesday!",

LoL.\n\nThis was my first time using a PAA soap, courtesy of /u/chill31613. Thanks! It reminds me of North York's really great coffee scent. Soap performance was good. I had a little irritation from the soap but nothing major. I won't be buying it but it was fun to try. I'm game for anything with coffee!\n\nThe B3 Nebula is breaking in nicely. It seems like it's softening up.\n\nI'm getting great results with the CG Level 2 razor. I can't count the number of razors I've bought and sold when they didn't perform anywhere close to my BBS-1, but this one is a keeper. The last two uses I've gotten closer shaves than my BBS-1 with no irritation. I'm not sure this is a razor that I could use every day (maybe?) like the BBS-1, but it's performing extraordinarily well.\n\nSong of the Day: [Pink Floyd \"Set The Controls For The Heart Of The Sun\"] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zuEfmmCA5s)",

I used to notice this before but I pretty much always used to use it in the bath so I thought it had something to do with that. Today I just had a standard shave in the bathroom and it did dissipate quite a bit, on the first pass it was fine but the second and third lathers were quite thin.\n\nThe balm is great when my skin needs a bit of moisturising but not a lot - very nice product with a pleasant scent.\n\nHappy shaves.",

I thought my spending was out of control. But you've inspired me to work through some of the samples i've picked up along the way.. First up, Maggard's Tobacco and Leather. Yup, I'm allergic to it. Second soap i've ever been allergic to. My face burns after half a pass and solidered on through it. I have no idea what's in this soap that i could be allergic too. but now i know. Oh well.\n\nHappy Thursday, all!",

All my stuff (wallet, car keys, phone, etc.) were also in the truck, so I was stranded there. Long story short, it took me like two hours to get back into the truck. Rather annoying - but will make a funny story.\n\nThis shave was a nice way to wind down this evening. I might have had enough Lavanda for one full shave, but the remaining bit of the sample kept moving around the container, so I loaded as much as I could and then smeared a bit of Coate's on my face before face lathering. Breaking in boar brushes is so much fun - just a few weeks ago, I would never have used this little guy to face lather. I might get rid of the couple synths I have and focus solely on boars.\n\nAlso my first go with Vide Poche - first word that came into my head when I applied it was \"succulent.\" It's got an almost candy-like sweetness to it, which I would normally find cloying, but seems to work here for some reason. I attribute it to the skillful blending of /u/hawns.\n\nThis blade seems to have somehow taken a great step forward. Tonight's shave was smooth as butter - I don't know if I'm just used to the tuggy first pass or if it got less tuggy. Perhaps tomorrow will tell.",

His seascape and starscape handles are unique offerings in the artisan brushmaker space as far as I know, and they're among the best looking designs I've seen. Go buy all of his stuff now.\n\nAlso, have a happy friday, everyone!",

These creams certainly perform quite well. I got a quick, slick, and easy lather by squeezing some cream right onto the damp brush and lathering it on my face. Next time I might try the /u/Cadinsor method of shmearing the cream on my face (giggity) and then just hitting that with a wet brush.\n\nThe scent strength on this really isn't even too bad. Once lathered, I'd say it's mid-level. Maybe the low end of Mid, but not too weak or anything. I get a really floral, almost perfumey lavender. It's nice stuff.\n\nBlade seems even less efficient, so may be time to bin it, but I'll probably try it again tomorrow.",

Absolute minimal pressure used this time and the irritation is sky high once again whilst the closeness has been sacrificed. If you've got skin like alligator leather and stubble like rice paper this may be the razor for you. But not me unfortunately...",

But I've read good comments about this soap and I thought I would give it a try. I'm glad I did. This particular scent is a pirate theme scent. The leather is forward to my nose. Very nice scent. The real concern to me was how well would it perform. Pretty damn good as it turned out. /u/Fahrenheit915, ya done good son. I loaded a bit light to begin with since this was my first time with it. After realizing this I loaded more generously and got a really good protective lather suitable for the razor I chose for today.\n\nA friend pointed me to a thread on B&B about a guy claiming his ER 1914 and GEM MMOC shave identically. Well bully for him. I have an older model of MMOC with no bumps in the base plate. Maybe this is the reason. I really don't know. But I'm pretty sure I know wtf I'm doing and my particular MMOC still deserves to be called The Queen Bitch of Harshness. There is no fucking way this thing even comes close to either of my 1914s in terms of comfort. Yeah, I got a close shave with it, as close as any razor I have, but it just isn't enjoyable to use like most of my other razors. In fact, it may be my least enjoyable razor. Rant over.

I got 1 oz sample tub, and immediately orded the matching splash. I really love the sharp earthy smell, under the green vegetals. A very invigorating and fresh scent, perfect for a hot summer day.\n\nSince I missed yesterday, I decided to grab the G-Bar, which had no issues mowing down an extra day's growth in a smooth comfortable manner. I'm really taking a liking to these GEM style SEs.\n\n\n\nHave a good one.",

I was a little worried about irritation after my face rejected Y/R/P. Seemed to be a little warmer than some other aftershaves, but wasn't too bad. One of the stronger scents I've used. Went down for dinner right after applying the splash, and a couple people in my house were fumed out of the room :P It died down a little bit after a few minutes.\n\nThis blade's definitely done. Didn't feel very efficient and was a little less comfortable, especially on the third pass.\n\nThe lather from L&L is so nice that it sometimes makes me feel like I can do anything, so I sort of overshaved on my jawline trying to get it smooth. A bit of extra sting from the AS for that lol.\n",

One weeper below the lower lip because I did too many ATG swipes. I'm way better at using this razor than my other razors, probably because it has the right combination of sharpness and feel. I received the 23mm Muhle today and it feels pretty great. I think a 23mm bulb is around the perfect size for me. Some of the hairs are a little pokey, but maybe that'll change since I feel like the 21mm got slightly less harsh with use.\n\nUsing the Iced Pineapple soap cemented my face's dislike of menthol. I think I'll probably get rid of all my menthol stuff. I used Dapper Dragon Tiamat one more time just to be certain (the smell is fantastic) and man my face is red as fuck. Once again Lucky Tiger alone didn't provide my face with sufficient moisturization. I traded for some more Chatillon Lux samples... hopefully one of those will smell good to me and I'll have an everyday aftershave balm to use.",

It's been just over 20 years since he dropped *Endtroducing,* and dude is still at the top of his game. The track featuring Nas is straight dragon fire.\n\nWill's *Reserve* line is top of the line as well. This stuff is damn good in every respect. If *Cool* is my favorite of the 3 currently available scents, *Classic* is a very, very close second. That will all change in a couple of months when *Fern* drops, though. /u/hawns was not mistaken when he claimed that his *Santal Auster* would pair well with *Classic.* This pairing is going to be in heavy rotation once summer starts turning into autum around here. It's nice, sunny and cool today so it's working pretty well regardless, especially once I spritz on some *Rose Santal* in a bit here so that I can smell good while I'm grocery shopping.\n\nEnjoy your Sunday, all. I'ma procrastinate until lunch and then do some cleaning.",

I've never cut myself with it, but am prone to burn if I shave with too much gusto and flair.\n\nThe Piacenza is nice. It's is, to my nose, a little less bright that Acqua di Parma Colonia. I think that the Colonia is a little crisper and brighter than the Piacenza. The Piacenza feels a little more muddied in its composition. Still a good scent. I think that RazorRock's XXX gets a little closer to the scent of the Colonia, but I prefer the Stirling soap base for performance.\n\nThis is with all due respect to Stirling's soap. I can see why scents are tough to duplicate; you could hit all the right notes and still not get the gestalt of the composition down. You probably need to really sit down and iterate with a lab's gas chromatography machine to go from a 90% match of a fragrance to a 99.5% match. That is assuming it is even possible to match an alcohol-based perfume in a tallow soap; I'm sure that brings its own special challenges.\n\nI think that this soap is an eventual \"buy\" from me (I need to use up some other soap first to free up a \"slot\"). I like the value and the performance of Stirling, and I think that this is one of the better scents from them, judged on its own merits. It just doesn't totally nail the Colonia fragrance for me.",

Feels good to be doing it again. I got this soap on loan from /u/landlgrooming to try out. Not sure what to think of it, it's a little sweet for my tastes. I enjoyed the AS far more than the soap - the scent was definitely quite different as far as what notes came out, and the menthol chill was welcoming and fresh feeling. As it dries down - going on ~1hr now - it does start being somewhat reminiscent of the beloved Porch Drinks. Ultimately, the scent probably misses the mark for me just a bit, but I had a good shave nonetheless and am enjoying the scent on the AS as it dries down and lingers at a perfect strength.",

I received the LE from Vintage Scents on Saturday, did some prep and had a lot of beginning split ends almost immediately. I let it dry until this morning and put it to the test of a shave. Verdict: What a great brush!:-)) It loaded very easily and as soon as I went to my face my eyes opened up. It is not like any other Semogue boar that I have (610, 620, SOC) or like any Omega that I have (B&B 10th Anniversary, 40033, 49). It made perfect, creamy slick lather very quickly and the face feel was absolutely terrific with good scrub and exfoliation. This is not a typical Semogue in that the splits occurred with very little break-in. The handle is terrific. It feels great in the hand, the fluted shape has opposing facets of two different sizes. The knot? Semogue makes perfectly shaped knots IMO and this one is perfectly shaped too. The quality of this boar brush is on a par with the Omega B&B 10th Anniversary and that is saying something. Oh and the color! The brown is almost a perfect match for my Steampunk Tech. This is its first shave? Wow!\n\nPerfect lather, perfect shave!",

Fitting way to pop open my new bottle of Rose Santal! No idea what to pair it with, so I went with something fresh and relatively neutral. Upon application, the first note is almost metallic, but it dries down into a wonderfully creamy, spicy fragrance. Love at... second sniff? :P\n\nOn another note, Adagio and Reserve Cool are my absolute favorite pairing, and work beautifully together. This was my first time trying out my Georgetown Pottery scuttle (I have the G20), and it made the best lather I've experienced so far. Review upcoming!",

Or I would, except that the 2nd one was *Catalan's Prairie* and that's my favorite scent ever.\n\nSeriously though, these 3 scents were nearly perfect choices for the Anniversary month, because they basically capture all of summer: You've got *Rose Santal*, a nice bridge between seasons with its sandalwood accord, which works for the transitional period as well as high summer. There's *Catalan's Prairie,* which is high summer in a bottle, and *Bon Vivant,* which isn't really seasonal but does cover those warm, boozy summer jam days when you need it. Nice work on all 3 of these /u/hawns and /u/landlgrooming.\n\nIn other news, this AP Shave Mixed knot is breaking in nicely. Nearly all of the scritch it originally had is gone, and it's developing an incredibly soft face feel with a good amount of backbone. In my opinion these things are well worth the money.\n\nOK back to it. Enjoy your Monday, all.",

I've been wetshaving for a few years and would like to think I know what I'm doing. Last night I used my broken in SOC. It hogged lather. I also didn't load enough. I ultimately didn't get the lather to where I wanted it. It was super hot and lather was drying out. My razor was very uncomfortable, I probably needed to swap the blade. Got some minor irritation.

I've always though this little plastic razor was very cool but felt it shaved a little rough. I think this is the first time I've used it with a Permasharp and it delivered an excellent irritation free shave. Myrkviðr and Aspen make a great foresty combo as usual. I forgot how nice this soap is after not using it for a while. The lather is slick and protective but I find that it gets airy kind of quickly. Anyone else have this issue? This is the start of my second round testing all the 7 o'clock blades and it looks like two contenders have appeared: Permasharp and Super Platinum Who will emerge victorious? Stay tuned and find out!",

Overloaded the soap which hurt me in the lather. This brush is dense and has great backbone and even though I wasn't pressing down and just letting the tips pick up the soap I feel like I went from not enough to way too much in the blink of an eye. Love L & L soap and the only thing I can really knock it on is that I wish it was a firmer as that's a preference of mine. Also, it had been a while since using the SE razor so I was a little off on the angle and didn't get quite a close as I usually do and had a touch of irritation.",

Today was a good day, and totally made up for the crap day the day before.\n\nPhoenix & Beau outstanding performance, Denali was great! Not overly cold, but definitely a pleasure to use during these hot summer days.\n\nWolfman performed great, having a little trouble with the angle, I definitely need to get 100 pack of these platinum blades, they're incredibly smooth.\n\nAnyway, Have a good day guys!",

My only nit would be that I wish it had a touch more backbone but that's minor. It'll still be a staple in the rotation.",

I defunked it with a few practice lathered last night. There really wasn't much funk at all. This morning I had to change my plan. I was going to use a cream, but I figured a triple milled soap would be appropriate for a boar's first actual use. My first impressions are very favorable. It didn't eat lather like my 620 and 830 did. Admittedly I loaded really heavy, but still, I had >4 passes in the brush. No shit. It has appreciable backbone that I'm sure will probably loosen up some as it breaks in.\n\nThe Alumigoose has quickly earned a spot in heavy rotation. My SE binge continues.\n\nUgh...work.",

First up is Italian Stallion. Off the dry sample, I get a citrus scent that reminds me of a faint Italian Citrus, but not exactly that. Performance was absolutely stellar as I anticipated. MLS is really creeping up in my den (# wise) and they absolutely deserve it with the scents & performance of their soaps.\n\n\n\nAs for the razor, I have been looking to get one of the SS versions for quite some time and I was finally able to pick one up last week. Idk what blade I used, as its been sitting on my shelf for quite some time and I completely forgot about it. Whatever it was, it was a great combination. Hawk was as smooth as butter cutting threw my whiskers. This SS version is a lot smoother than its aluminum counter part. Honestly, if I didn't have 2 DE's that I really loved (UAG & AL R1) I'd probably only be using SE's :D\n\n\n\n**Have a great shave everyone!!**",

I have a theory about why it was delayed several days; they were waiting for the box to dry after they broke *both* bottles off at the neck.\n\nOf course, u/hawns - fine gentleman that he is - sent out replacements immediately. Assuming USPS doesn't screw it up again, I should have my aftershave soon. In the meantime, my bathroom smells amazing (the box with the broken bottles is sitting on the counter), and I have confirmation that my girlfriend likes the smell. Overall, I'm pretty happy.",

Holding it in my hand I get the feeling this isn't intended to last too long. The plastic feels a touch fragile and there are a few areas that seem a little sketchy shall we say. In use it seems fairly intuitive and the blade feels as though it's cutting quite nicely. However, it isn't. It's incredibly mild. BBS was possible and in fairness there is absolutely zero irritation but the journey wasn't as easy as I'd like.\n\nI genuinely think this was created for 2 reasons. 1, to introduce cartridge shavers to the world of wet shaving and 2, to introduce wet shavers to the OneBlade. I've heard the Genesis is more efficient than the Core and after this outing I must say it has piqued my interest. I've also heard the Core has been modified slightly so perhaps it'll be worth trying v.2",

Now I've been using it exclusively for a few shaves and it's done quite well. Still very hard to get my neck area clean but it gives me a nice shave.\n\nI revisited the Palmolive after quite a long time. I was surprised by how quickly I was able to load it, only around 10 seconds and my brush was covered in soap. A nice, simple soap.\n\nI've really enjoyed using the Nivea 2 Phase, it feels good on the skin and is absorbed pretty quickly. It's not as cooling as I would have liked but it's moisturising enough for my skin as of now.\n\nHappy shaves.",

But this was my first go with Storybook Hook soap. /u/Fahrenheit915 delivered something very legit. The scent is really nice, and approved by wife & 2 daughters -- so that's a keeper. Performance wise I'd have to use it more to comment, but very good impression in the slickness and post shave departments. The A/S left my face very soft. I get more leather from the A/S than from the soap, and it's a very pleasant, mild leather scent.\n\nI was lucky enough to get that Ti Triad from Toby on Etsy a couple weeks back. The knurling on this thing is so deep I thought I'd slit my fingers. But a couple of shaves in and it's a winner. It's here to stay.\n\nEnjoy your day everyone!",

The NEW LC is really shining right now. Ever since I figured out the GSBs worked so well for me in my Slim, I've been trying them in other razors. They really took my NEW LC from a meh razor to almost as good, if not better, than my Slim. Looking forward to trying them in more razors I previously set aside.",

I didn't because there is no barbershop in the line and I like to match soaps and aftershaves. Shout out to /u/hughmonstah for sending me a sample of the Unconditional Soap. After just one use I knew I had to grab a full puck. Shout out to /u/RobInFresno for having some available back-up pucks for sale. I don't know what it is about this scent but it is incredible. Bravo /u/hawns, I am officially a fanboy.\n\nThe salve is damn good. I can see myself using this more in the winter than the summer. It's like spreading thick clay on there and it just sticking. My face feels great. Bring it on harsh winters.\n\nLastly, this is now my third EdT this year. I had zero at the start of the year. This EdT just builds on top of the soap and aftershave. I could wear this fragrance every day if I had an endless supply.",

This sample was graciously provided by /u/onabluecloud - thanks again! Upon hearing this scent would be discontinued, I wanted to try it out before it was too late and it seemed (surpsied) a little polarizing so I didn't want to blind buy it. Luckily for me, I didn't get the cherry vicks/medicine smell that I've heard others get from it, but it still turned out to not quite be my thing. It's a pleasant scent, and it was to me peppery but floral/fruity combo with only a hint of cherry in the lather. I found the menthol level to be perfect, not enough to be that cold, but enough to be refreshingly cool. Because of that, I decided to finish it off with Floid Blue which I hadn't used in awhile. Overall, a great fresh and clean feeling shave that relaxed me for the evening.",

For me the brush had 0 scritch, was extremely soft, decent backbone, and is extremely soft on the tips.

It is a nice scent but it doesn't do much for me. The way I look at it is if I had a full tub of this and could trade for another scent, I would.\n\nThe Omega is a good bush I just wish it was softer. I really have spoiled myself on soft brushes. However, I am not so certain it has been used all that much so I am going to put it in rotation so it can get some use.\n",

But then /u/darkfox45's been encouraging me to shave more often AND post more often so here we are.\n\nDue to some bad/out-of-control SAD, I've got a couple of tubs of SOA but never actually shaved with them. Well, today I finally did. Overall, I would say it's what I've come to expect out of B&M soaps - lathers beautifully, slick, post-shave is great. The scent though was surprising. Off the puck, it's got a great scent that I've been told is Passiflora lite. During the shave, I felt it was milder than what I've sniffed from other B&M soaps. I will have to shave again with it to determine whether I'm going to keep it or not.\n\nShout-out to SC balms. This stuff is great! I currently have Love and Optimism and it's taking all of my will-power not to get more of their stuff. Wish I could sample more of their balms for the scent!",

Hook has notes of leather, gunpowder and seawater. I really like it. I used a Charcoal Goods Level 2 Dual Comb, a Semogue LE (2011) boar #1, and Dominica Bay Rum to finish. The chest they're sitting on is a family war chest that is about 150 years old and was used in the war against the Zulus in South Africa. Really nice shave.

BBS-1\n\nBlade: Wizamet IS ES (4)\n\nPost: Mickey Lee Soapworks Jefferson Square\n\nThis soap is kindly on loan to me from /u/Eric--m (Thanks!), and my first use. It felt fairly soft in the tin, so I used a damp brush with the tips dipped in the water again. It loaded quickly, similar to the way L&L loads, with a similar result...the stringy soap that looks like mogwais eating chicken after midnight. It didn't take much work to get the loaded brush to a full on lather, with needing to add just a little water twice. I ended up with a nice shiny, slick lather, and a great shave. The post shave face feel is neutral in my opinion. It doesn't feel drying at all, but not super moisturizing either, I can dig it.\nThe scent was very mild, I only picked up a little of the lavender, and maybe a touch of lemon in the background.\nI went with MLS Jefferson Square to bring the lavender up a bit, and add just a little moisturizing this stuff is awesome for these hot days!\n\nHope everyone has a great day!",

Took it out Monday night and let it dry all day Tuesday. Visibly the tips had definitely split. This morning I loaded up until the tips were pasty and well loaded, then went into a face lather. Still some light scritch but I was expecting that considering it's the first use. Not as much as you'd expect for a brand new brush though. This definitely has great backbone as it loaded quickly and easily and had that great boar scrubbiness on the face. Looking forward to this thing being well broken in.",

That is one cold combo. Being my first experience with a highly-mentholated soap, I wasn't quite sure how intense it would be, but I was pleasantly surprised. It was cold yet very refreshing after the gym and a hot shower. I suppose now I'll have to try the Cryogen sample I've yet to use. Cheers.",

I tried using a straight a couple years ago but didn't really get enough shaves under my belt to become proficient. I'm about 10-12 shaves in on this go round, and steadily improving. Neck is still a bit tricky since it grows sideways there, but it's getting easier.\n\nSide note: this shaving cream is weird. It's completely liquid; about the consistency of the Nivea balm. It lathers well, though, and has lanolin, which is pleasantly unexpected for a cream.",

I guess i have to break the brush in which is the most painful part of using any boar brush.\n\nI would like to give credit to the design of the brush. It is really pretty with the two toned design of the handle - presenting a nice contrast. Secondly the engraving at the bottom of the handle just oozes classiness.\n\nEnjoy your shave and enjoy your day !",

It takes me so long to make a lather that I feel like whatever benefit a shower has is diminished. So I made the lather first, then took my shower, came back face still dripping and went to town. Seemed to go as well as normal, so jury is still out whether it helped. Mild irritation on the neck, but not as red as recent shaves.\n\nHappy Thursday everyone!",

Anyways, the emulsion is a thicker milky balm that is nice and moisturizing. Used it for pre and post and have no complaints. I really think it made a difference because my lather was complete shit and I didn't get any irritation.\n\nBreaking in Semogues sucks. Extreme lather killer and I barely had enough to do 2 passes. Oh well, I'll continue to break this in with more wet/dry cycles and palm lathers rather than full shaves for a while.",

The source said, \"Use *Hallows.* Trust me.\" I did, and the rest is this shave. *Hallows* does a great job playing on *Civet's* base notes, so I'm loving it this morning. The fact that it's cool and rainy doesn't hurt, either.\n\nThis Semogue brush continues to impress. I wouldn't mind a bit more density in the knot, but its face feel is undeniably good. 3 shaves in, and it needs absolutely no soaking whatsoever. Just wet the knot and load 'er up.\n\nThe Schick blade in this E2 is getting binned after its next shave. I could probably stretch it more than that, but it's starting to get inefficient on me. I needed a lot of buffing in order to get the job done this morning, and even though it wasn't uncomfortable at all, I feel like it's time to let it go. I think I've gotten my money's worth out of it.\n\nEnjoy your Thursday, all.",

I had to lather with the scuttle sitting on the counter, and although it made a wonderful hot lather rivaling what I get at my local barbershop, the lather broke down in a few minutes at that temperature. The second pass took some work to get incorporated into a workable lather. If I try using a kettle for this again, it will have to be at a much lower temperature.",

CdL as in Champs de Lavande, not as in a Commercial Driver's License. I don't think much about getting a Commercial Driver's License. I mean, sure, who hasn't had a Smoky and the Bandit fantasy about driving a commercial big rig loaded to the gills with bootleg Coors beer just trying to outrun the law and make it to the county line? With Sally Field looking all tasty in her peak-70s girl-next-door sneaky hotness. Ummm hummm....\n\nMaybe you forgot she had it in her after they squirreled her up in the latter scenes of \"Forrest Gump\" and when she was doing her \"Shelby, DRINK JUICE!\" thing as Julia Roberts' mom in \"Steel Magnolias.\" It's easy to overlook a solid 7 when you got Julia Roberts' 10 sharing the screen.\n\nBut TBH, I could see Julia totally starfishing out, thinking she's too good to please her partner and put in work between those sheets.\nYou think Sally Fields wouldn't take care of you? I bet anything that Sally knows some things, and understands the importance of Kegels. She seems like the type who would tell you how handsome you are today and how much she admires you as a person before you're off to work that gives you that bit of confidence you were needing, but when you get home she's wearing a little number from Vicky's Secret that she just happened to pick up today, and she will have set up a mirror in front of the bed, and want to leave the lights on. It'd be dirty, sure, but it'd be passionate and deeply connected...like your heartbeats are in sync, your movements are so perfectly aligned, and just feeling like your souls are in communion or something.\n\nSally would have you saying cheesy shit.\n\n\"I never really liked to cuddle before I met you.\"\n\n\"I want to take you to Paris.\"\n\nForget Julia. You think Julia has this in her?\n\n\n",

The container looks small, but Scott is not joking when he says a little bit goes a long way.\n\nMaggard does the London Barbershop scent very well - whether it's the balm, oil, soap, or aftershave. If they made it a cologne, that would be an instant-buy for me.\n\nAch Brito's Lavanda is...look, it's lavender, which I like. It has some musk, which I like. Some people will always have an association with older women and lavender perfume, so prepare for those comments and for any romantic partners to veto that scent.\n\nEdit: formatting. I think this is how I'll keep the formatting from now on. Or not.\n*formatting*",

Too much effort and with so many artisans I'd rather just use something else. I'll only be picking up their soaps from the bazaar from here on out. Too expensive, too many issues, probably why they got dropped from Maggards. Anyways done with my P&B rant.",

It is t enough burn to be really concerned about, but I have others that don't burn at all, so why keep it.\nOnly went with two passes today, but it's all good...BBS-1 was there to help me through this rough time =P\n\nHave an awesome day everyone!",

First time using the soap and it felt awesome, a/s was great too, has some great staying power. Kind of pushed my face to hard by shaving with so many different combos lately, probably shouldn't have used a feather today, few weepers here and there, but they sealed with a splash of A/S. But this soap has the potential to be one of my favorites. Off the puck it has a really refined barbershop scent, I didn't read the description when I first took a whiff and didn't tell barbershop until i read it was. When lathered it reminds me slightly of Black Dragon, has a licorice scent to it and i really like it. Happy shaving all",

On a trip to Sullivan's Island, SC with the wife, boy, and parents, so I brought my travel razor. It is great with the Feathers. I've never used any blade but the Personna Lab Blues, and these are definitely a step up for me. I did my usual 2 pass, and got the best shave I've gotten from the tech. I hear feathers improve after a shave, too, which is exciting.\n\nThe soap is great, too. It reminds me both in performance and scent of WhollyKaw's Washington's blend, but maybe less mossy and more spicy. I really like this soap--mild but pleasant scent and whipped up in no time. Thanks again to /u/whiskyey for the PIF. I can't wait to try the razor out when I get home.",

I don't dislike it, but I think it's an acquired taste, that eventually I'll probably like. I am usually drawn to the unusual scents, and this is definitely unusual.\n\n\nCL's toner. What can I say. Always gives amazing post-shave feel and skin conditioning. This brand will never leave my den. Ever.",

Recently been using the synth and damn I never knew how much of a lathering machine it was. It loads soaps really quickly, with the Stirling Badger I had to load quite a lot to get a similar amount of lather.\n\nI used to have a lot of trouble with Black Cherry since it was always at least a little dry. Today the lather was probably the best one I've gotten with it but it was still a bit dry underneath. Good lather nonetheless.\n\nHappy shaves!",

I am not an uber fan of menthol, but I do have a weakness for vetiver. This is straight Hatian vetiver. The menthol is near the upper limit of what I like. Dat vetiver tho. Mmmmmm.\n\nI got up a little earlier than usual and I felt the urge to use a straight. A nice long shave that gave the menthol time on my skin. Half hour later and I still feel the lingering effects.\n\nSo glad it's Friday. I have a busy weekend ahead of me. Off to work.",

I didn't initially purchase it when it came out because I went with Colbeck instead and they sounded too similar to get both. Big mistake. Luckily, FOMO kicked in and I added it to my list and my Santa decided to get it for me. I don't know how to describe it other than incredible. It's got a cologne like vibe to it that I totally dig. The menthol didn't seem as crazy cool (in a good way to me) as Colbeck. Thanks again Santa and it was a great shave before I hopped in the car for a quick weekend road trip.",

The scent of Delor de Treget is not for me at all unfortunately and will be going up on the bazaar for trade.\n\nI also used the break-in method for my boar brush that was mentioned on here earlier and was amazed by how well it worked.

Often I'm too lazy to shave twice a week. I'm finding that a weeks worth of whisker growth usually irritates my face. Only a tiny bit or irritation this time on the right side of my adam's apple. I was given this Gillette NEW by a friend. She said it belonged to someone in her family but she's not sure who considering it is from the 30's or 40's. It shaves nicely but I may prefer the Tech. I borrowed a bottle of Armaf Craze Noir for men from a coworker a while ago. To my nose it smelled very similar to Nivea's Original Balm. It's damn hot here in Texas. Happy Friday ya'll!",

I've been anxiously keeping an eye on my shave count... when I get to 90 shaves (half a year worth of shaving) I'll probably spring for a fancy straight (Dovo Pearlex? Something with spine work! Anyone have any recommendations?) then at around a year of shaving, a custom brush (thinkin a 23/24mm BrushCraft/Declaration) :D Can't wait.\n\nIn other news, I didn't really expect to like this soap, but it turns out the smell is pretty inoffensive and the post-shave feel is pretty darn great. Not Wholly Kaw great, but close enough. I didn't really like the performance of the CL toner sample I got last shave, so we'll see how it treats me this time. I'm glad I stuck with the salve for my Fourth and Pine blind buy.",

He managed to snag this tin of soap and made it available to me. I suck at describing scents. I'm limited to \"smells good\" or \"smells bad\". This smells good. It's complex without being overdone. I would call it on the brighter side of the middle. I wish I would have had the time to appreciate the performance more, but I was rushed this morning. Busy day ahead.",

It's a trip through an actual baseball field, with every smell but the rancid bathrooms and sweaty people sitting around you. Great stuff.\n\nThe Suavecito aftershave was chosen today because its mild scent strength - I really like the smell of Diamond. This isn't to downplay its soothing mintiness, but the scent will be nearly gone in five minutes, while Diamond is still going strong.\n\nThrough the Fire Fine Craft's Ember is my favorite scent out of all their offerings. Heavy, sweet spice balanced by the perfect amount of fruitiness, especially bergamot.\n\nAzzaro Wanted is my wife's number one choice for me to wear out of my current colognes. To my unprofessional nose, its base note consists mostly of woodsy vetiver, with the rest of the scent consisting of slightly weaker spice and sweet frbit. The actual ingredients are more numerous and complex, but hey, I'm just an average-nose guy.",

I just did the cheeks but it felt very awkward. It was difficult seeing what was going on and the blade was about 1/5 as smooth as my BBS-1. I know the learning curve is steep and will try to make it work.\n\nAfter the rough cheek shave, my BBS-1 entered the fold and produced a magnificent shave. I love the creeper. Such a great soap and combination today.\n\nCheerio!\n\nSong of the Day: [Phillip Phillips \"Home\"] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HoRkntoHkIE)",

I have no idea how elfster works as my giftee will confirm) for this soap. I really enjoyed the scent on this one and the performance was right up there! To me, even more than the LE FB which makes me wonder if I did something wrong with that soap.\n\nI had purchased the balm alongwith the LE FB but based off the balm, I wasn't sure about the soap. Am i glad I got this soap! It's a great take on the rose scent, and given that \"possibilities\" exist around YRP, I'm seriously considering giving up my backup tub to make place for this one. Keeper for sure!!",

I liked the balance between the citrus and warm rich elements of the base. Almost soda shop-y. I mean that as a compliment: many of the fragrances I like have a \"cola\" or \"root beer\" aspect to them. I think that this is a the play between citrus and resins (like benzoin or oppopanox).\n\nThe soap, on the other hand, smelled a little like hot pepper seeds (maybe the petitgrain?). Sharp and slightly bitter. I didn't notice the same warm base as the splash. While I was shaving with it, I thought to myself: \"hey, this could use a little vanilla or a nice resin\". Maybe an old or mislabelled sample? Big difference in smells to my nose.\n\nThe soap performed extremely well, though! I just can't imagine a situation where I'd reach for this soap over, say, Seville.",

This was VERY cool if you !!!!! THANK YOU!!!!! =)\nWhen I opened the tub, it looked a little like Freddy Krueger's skin =P First sniff off the puck wasn't too appealing to me. Right up front was a big blast of what I believe is the castoreum, and had a bit of a Play-Doh kind of smell to me. I decided to ignore the off the puck scent and just go ahead and lather it up.\nWhen I heard that T+S was going to a new, softer formula, I was a little nervous. I couldn't think of how the first formula could really be improved upon. I was surprised when loading the brush, I didn't notice it being too soft at all. I used a little less water in my brush than I usually do, and it loaded right up! From there I went straight to my face for a nice rich creamy lather. I added a little water once after everything had come together evenly, and I was rewarded with even more of this great, slick lather. Much impress!\nFirst thing I picked up was cedar, but it was a mellow cedar, then fir. The fir came out a little more until the cedar subsided bit, then seemed to be a perfect blend of fir and cedar. When I think of this combination, I think I would expect it to be a little warmer than it is in this example, which is almost a tiny bit sweet to me. I'm guessing the castoreum that was so up front off the puck is what brought these two up and together, and made it a very pleasant scent for summer. I didn't pick up much of any coffee in the lather or post shave.\nThe aftershave is a much different product than their previous offering, being alcohol based rather than water based. When I sniffed the bottle, it smelled pretty harsh, I'm guessing more of the castoreum and alcohol, and a little coffee. After a few shakes onto my palm, and onto my face, I was quite surprised how the scent transformed into coffee, with some of the cedar and fir in the background, almost as if I were in a coffee shop. Where I didn't pick up the coffee in the soap, it was up front and center in the aftershave. A very nice rich coffee, but not heavy, it's a strange sensation for me not being a coffee drinker.\nThis formula left me with a nice moisturized, clean feeling. Nothing drying or greasy, and zero burn from alcohol, which from the scent off the bottle I thought I would catch at lest a little of.\nOverall I am very happy with both the scent and performance of this set! DFS for me, and I'm feeling good!!!\nI look forward to trying other sets in the near future!\n\nHave an excellent weekend everyone!!!!!\n=)",

Also, thank you to my Secret Santa for getting me this set of Southern Paradise before I move out (and before it's even released) and /u/landlgrooming for agreeing to the arrangement. /u/la_yerba_mate did such a great job on the label - it's probably my favorite L&L label he's done so far :)\n\nI've enjoyed the scent of Southern Paradise ever since I had my sample of the vegan version and I'm glad Scott released it again this year. He added menthol to the soap, which I find a very welcome condition, especially during the hot summer! It's definitely not Cryogen/Arctique levels, but it's a bit more than this year's release of Paradise Frost. I love the scent of peaches and tea, so the combo worked out perfectly for me.\n\nAs for the CFG brush. I think this summer is the summer of scrubbier brushes or something - it's not totally my cup of tea, but I know many will enjoy this. The hair feels (IMHO) very similar to the Declaration B3 hair and the M&F Finest I had earlier this year. Very scrubby tips with minimal hooking, but it did get noticeably softer after a few uses. I think I prefer the shapes Ron is doing - fan shaped more leaning towards a flat top than a bulb. I think the flatter top and higher loft makes the brush feel softer and the bloom feel huge relative to the knot size. I do think I would have preferred the loft to be a touch shorter, but it definitely was useable and probably better for me since I'm not a huge fan of scrubby brushes.\n\nAll in all, I think Ron's doing some quality work here and is a welcome addition to the brush making, knot-tying market. Unfortunately for me, it seems like all the suppliers are distributing scrubbier hairs or something at the moment, but I'm sure many others will thoroughly enjoy it.",

I ordered an Omega Mixed Midget brush to replace my [worn away](http://i.imgur.com/mxJqqVm.jpg) synthetic. Steel wool face is real.\n\nCaptain's Choice Lime is a bay rum scent mixed with lime. Very easy to build a thick, rich lather, it provides good cushion and decent slickness. The post shave feel could be much better.\n\nI ran out of my Captain's Choice Bay Rum AS splash, but my local barbershop carries Suavecito products, so it was quickly replaced. Feel the burn definitely applies to this splash, but the scent is strong and fairly long lasting - reaching into the two hour mark. The brand new Feather blade definitely contributed to that burn. I'm always tempted but forget to cork it before that first shave.\n\nThe 4711 is a pretty basic citrus scent that I love to wear in the summer, which lasts until November in Atlanta.\n\nToday will be the first day to try out the propane grills that are at my apartment building. I've been eyeing them from the edge of the pool - I might edit this post with a picture.\n",

I estimated 5 minutes as I took my time to try to get it right. This time I timed it at 30 seconds loading with an extra 2 minutes lathering. Whole process from start to end took 15 minutes, and got a good shave, albeit some irritation on the neck. Time for a new blade tomorrow.\n\nHope everyone had a great weekend!",

It's been a while since I cleaned my brush though, so I gave it a good cleaning afterwards with dish soap and vinegar. Hopefully that gets it back to normal. Oddly enough, after cleaning it with the above mentioned items, some of the original badger-y smell came back. It's not strong at all, but a good sniff and you pick up hints of that badger funk.",

I really like this razor! With the blades and how slick the WhollyKaw soap is, I didn't even feel the normal resistance of the hair cutting-- I just heard the sound and didn't see it there any more.\n\nI'm still figuring out the angle. The slant really is a mindfuck at first, so I had to clean up a few spots. This is also probably due to me trying not to draw any blood (successful there, at least). I really like it, though. I'm going to try to make it my daily use for a while and then compare it with my Slim (my current daily use).\n\nThese blades are a definite win. I'm going to do some exploration with GSB, Polsilver, Astra, Voskhod, Rapira and Wizamet and then switch to whatever I like the best. I've been using Personna Lab Blues since I started and never explored any.",

However, something about this brush makes me want to keep using it, and use it I will at least every 3rd day or twice a week until it's broken in.\n\n\nI am a face latherer, and doing that with an unbroken in boar is asking for trouble.\n\n\nI felt the brush, and after soaking it for 5 mins, I think I can handle it, at least for the first pass, focusing much of the action on my neck, which can handle it just fine.\n\n\nAfter the first pass, as expected the boar ate my lather. Face lathering with this brush in it's almost new state for the 2nd and third pass is simply asking for trouble. Brush burn galore.\n\n\nSo off to palm lathering for the 2nd and 3rd. Felt a little guilty about the soap; I had to use more than usual, but this SOC is intriguing. It's a wonderfully made brush, and I can't wait to try it in it's full glory. It's worth the extra software sacrifice.\n\n\nThe soap, is excellent. Oliva is a very good base that, I sometimes prefer it over the Select line, even though many of my favorites are dominated by tallow based formulas.\n\n\nThe aftershave. What can I say. It's a joy to use. I wish I can purchase 5 bottles of this fantastic toner and maybe I will. A rich amber not only in scent, but in color.\n\n\nCheers",

I have an important morning meeting, so I had to go with a more conservative scent. I was very pleased with how the shave turned out with the Ball End. It feel so mild, yet it's able to do an incredible job on the stubble. I'm also able to go ATG in trouble spots with it without irritation, which is incredibly impressive. Really digging this razor.\n\nIs Monday over yet?",

I find that with a few days growth it's super-smooth and a very efficient razor. Once that first pass is over, that razor is just too aggressive for me hence the shift to the Rockwell. I've also noticed that when shaving with the #3 base, I have enough growth to justify another shave on the 3rd day rather than if I had used a #4 which leaves me with a in-between feel - not enough to shave, not enough to qualify as a neat stubble. Since I have a ton of soap and want to get through more shaves, this does seem like an efficient solution.\n\nAny opinion on how the Timeless is when compared to the Wolfman? Wondering whether I should trade one for the other.",

      "body": "*Full disclosure: I'm in a foul mood today and will be looking at the soap and beard oil again tomorrow.*\n\n[The Stuff](http://i.imgur.com/e0cqpRl.jpg)\n\n* **Prep**: Cold Shower\n* **Brush**: Maggard 22mm Synthetic\n* **Soap**: Through the Fire Fine Craft - Forged\n* **Razor**: Maggard Open Comb V2 with MR5 handle\n* **Blade**: Feather New Hi-Stainless - 2nd shave\n* **Aftershave**: Aqua Velva Blue\n* **Beard Stuff**: Grizzly Beard Oil - Campfire\n* **Cologne**: 4711 Original EDC\n\nI've loved the scents of TTFFC's beard care products, so I pulled the trigger on an interesting-looking shaving soap: Forged. I ordered a generous 1 oz sample of the \"activated charcoal\" soap, took a whiff, and smelled just soap. It's a very soapy smell.\nI'm going to order a different scent, since this performed well. It has strong scent strength before and after lathering, pretty easy to lather, great slickness, and an okay post-shave feel. The scent strength was a negative in this case because of the extreme soapy scent, but would be a positive with Ember or Ignite, provided those don't also have a strong soapy smell.\n\nThe aftershave was the only good part of this morning's routine. Aqua Velva Blue will always remind me of my Grandpa Mariano, and I'm forever itching to get some Old Spice cologne to go with it.\n\nI'm wearing 4711 again today; it's my warm-season everyday citrus cologne.\n\nOn to the beard oil. Think of a campfire, but with no smoke, very little woodsy smell, and no indication of any outdoorsy scent. Instead, it's just mild spice with the faintest hint of pine.\nThis was a free bottle that I got from the company's Facebook ad, and the site is a little shifty. You're given a notification (at least on mobile) every time someone buys anything, even a free sample, and the prices are all \"discounted,\" but the original prices are generally ridiculous. This is not to say that the discounted prices aren't good, in fact, they're a little bit cheaper than a lot of their competition. However, you have no real idea if the oils are actually sourced in the USA, and although the ingredient list is impressive, [my bottle didn't even come with a batch number.](http://i.imgur.com/st9YoAW.jpg)\n\nIn celebration of today's ~~crushing disappointment~~ temporary mediocrity, I put on my Linkin Park shirt that I bought 5 years ago when they released Living Things. It was a culmination of creativity, musicianship, and production that had been a long time coming. It stood out upon release and divided fans for all the right reasons. But don't worry, self, they'll sell out and make a just-another-pop-band album in five years. That album, which has strong (if simple and repetitive) lyrics, completely drops the musicianship and creativity that all of their previous albums showed. I guess fans weren't buying enough albums, and it sucks to see the album praised only for its emotional lyrics and commercial success.\n\nSorry, got a bit off track there. Shaving. Old school. Barrister & Mann Reserve. Duck tallow. ATT Calypso.\nThere we go. Happy shaves to the rest of you.\n",

I slipped up once. but that's fine, I'm human. I got my custom JD Arman razor in the mail and i've been waiting to open it until I hit my 30 days and i'm glad I did. I opened it this morning as a reward for making it. [Here she is.](http://i.imgur.com/zTWnNYw.jpg) I'm definitely going to shave with it tonight and post my feedback.\n\nHappy Monday! :/",

But I've been growing my hair out for a while, and it just got too hot to keep it up, so this is my first return to shaving in a while. I missed it. LGC is a wonderful scent. I think I like Chypres as a genre of scents. Got a great lather and completed the shave in 2 passes. Felt good!",

This morning, however, I had to shave as I let myself work too late (on reading BS on Reddit!) and went to sleep without shaving for the entire weekend. I couldn't put it off another day. So, I put some hot water into my shave cup, wet my brush, put on some soap, and lathered up.\n\nThis soap is a new find for me, and it was only my second time using it. Once again, I was very pleased with how it lathered up, how it applied to my face, how quickly I could whip it into a solid foam on my face, and how nice the blade glided on my face. The scent is phenomenal on its own, but its lubricating properties on my face are second to none. I have other decent soaps, but this Mickey Lee Soapworks stuff is now the bar against which all others are measured. For my skin, and with my razor, there is nothing that has worked as well. I'm almost tempted to give my son the rest of my soaps and stick with just this one.\n\nFirst pass was pretty good and I got surprisingly close. I could have stopped with one pass today even considering I started with three days of solid growth. But, I went for a second, and I'm glad I did.\n\nSecond pass was very smooth except for my chin (as usual), but now, it's baby smooth.\n\nApplied the AS which smells a bit strong going on, but feels nice and the smell settles quickly into a very nice scent my wife absolutely adores.",

You sir are a gentleman. Can't thank you enough for this soap and splash. I'm terrible at scents but I'll say the toner is warm and spicy. I splashed some on the back of my hand yesterday and couldn't stop smelling it for the rest of the day. /u/hawns you sir are crushing it.\n\nFun fact: I picked this hat up in the Vancouver airport a few years back. I was flying to Hawaii at the time. I was getting tired of random people asking me questions about whatever team happened to be on my hat at the time. Then I saw this beauty and couldn't resist. I wear the shit out of this hat.",

Few weepers on the left side of the upper lip where I tried (and decided against) going ATG. Another relatively eventless shave. I'm definitely getting faster and I'm comfortable with the W&B.\n\nThe Vanishing Cream felt minty without the menthol redness, but today my skin seems a bit ashy. After using the Muhle STF for two shaves it is fairly evident I do not like the Stirling badger. It is soft as hell but the backbone is lacking pretty badly and the splay on my face feels way too big. I wonder if this is a badger issue, or if it's just a result of brush being not that dense. The thing I hate most about the brush is that it still hogs a LOT more lather than the synthetic. I'll probably end up doing some back to backs with same soap before selling.",

T&S leaves my face feeling refreshed without any post treatment....however I have to follow through with it anyway. I like to pull the remaining lather from the brush and cover my face where I just shaved and leave it till I am finished cleaning my brush and tidying up. Cold water rinse the lather away and I am left with no irritation.\n\nHave a great shave.\n\n\n",

This brush continues to break in nicely. I'll likely move on from it by week's end though. My second go with Bufflehead was much better than my first shave. I was too rushed on the first one and didn't get the lather quite right. Today's lather was in a different league than the first time. This is a very slick soap. The Alumigoose is still impressing the hell out of me. Off to experience pain then work.",

Normally my scalp doesn't take well to consecutive days of shaving. I'm usually an every other day kinda guy. Maybe I'll go back to that, but I don't know. u/bostonphototourist you absolutely killed it with this soap base. THIS is a soap I could shave every day with. Loaded EZPZ, and not only did it not even flinch at my hard water, I drowned that soap and it made some of the best lather I've ever experience in my life. This is my 2nd shave after not shaving for a couple months. I feel infinitely more confident in my technique today than I did yesterday. There were no nicks/cuts yesterday, but it was certainly a slow shave. Today was a 2-pass in 10 minutes and it felt about as close to effortless as I imagine I'll ever get. This mornings shave was real good fam. Real good.",

Thanks again to /u/landlgrooming for providing these, it was an honor to win one.\n\nThese new B3 declaration brushes are definitely scrubbier than the previous batches. Tips are still soft, but the backbone seems stiffer than the previous batches. It was also a big switch from the boar. These brooshes are so dense, they hold an insane amount of water and lather. Throw in the magic of the Mayflower, and it made for an excellent shave.\n\n\n\nHave a good one.",

This cut down a lot on the extremely soapy smell that the soap had yesterday, and I'm getting a hint of citrus now. Still really good when it comes to performance, but a bit of a bummer in its scent.\n\nAn aside - I always get the best shaves on my feathers' third shave.\n\nI really wish this beard oil had a different name. I get it, the company is marketing to an intended audience, but damn, it's not Campfire, it smells like (very little) pine sap with warm spice notes over top of it. Add some cinnamon and nutmeg, and this would absolutely be a Christmas scent. At the very least, the scent is inoffensive and the oil keeps my beard conditioned through my day.\n\nNo extraneous subject rants today. Just one piece of advice: Go see Spider-Man Homecoming.\n",

I ended up putting ice in the sink just to get the water cool enough to be refreshing. The artist club provided a great shave in conjunction with the reserve cool, which was paired with floid blue, which was given by my secret Santa (and it's great. I am truly thankful someone gave me a portion of their stash of this incredible product)\n\nThe lather was nice, the brush was actually the second brush I've made, with a 24mm Maggard synthetic knot set in it. I plan on making many more brushes, but this one is special because it was a sort of proof of concept for me. I finally finished a brush that I had spent a few weeks trying to get all the little details worked out on.\n\nHave a great day everyone!",

I had planned to skip today, but now there's a PIF I want in on so I figured I'd just keep the ball rolling. Funny enough, I forgot about the need for a lather shot until after my first pass, so, you know, not as great of a lather shot as it could be. RIP.\n\nAnyway, about the shave. I LOVE this soap. u/hawns and u/landlgrooming absolutely killed it with this. This was the first introduction to fougeres for me (I've had this for some time and have since picked up a few more) and it completely opened my eyes to the scent-genre. This scent is nothing shy of brilliant, to me, and at this point nobody needs me to defend the performance of Scoot's soap base. Had an easy time lathering, incredible performance, 2-pass shave in about 10 minutes again.\n\nI really am quite impressed with this little badger brush. I picked it up on a whim, but was perfectly content with just sticking to synthetic brushes, but every time I use this thing, I'm pleasantly surprised. Glad I picked it up. Also, boy, GSB blades break in like champs. Some of my most comfortable shaves I've ever had have been GSBs on shaves like 8-14. Good stuff.\n\nOkay, I think that's what I've got to say, thanks fro reading my novel! Lol. I've got a wedding to fly out to tomorrow, and I may just be looking to disconnect a bit, so y'all may not see me around until Monday. If that's the case, I hope you all have a wonderful day, and an incredible rest of your week and weekend. I wish you all nothing but the most comfortable shaves you've ever had!",

When it showed up I was like \"it's pretty good but meh.\" Decided to try it last night and...wow. Every time I get a new Bufflehead I think to myself that it's better than the last. This scent is heavenly. To me, it's a sweet and bright floral with the floral note not at the forefront, but providing a nice backbone that ties everything together. Bufflehead continues to be my favorite scent maker with this one.",

So smooth, such and easy shave. Treets are the tits too... I am really enjoying this signature scent, other than knowing it is petrichor-esque I find it challenging to describe the scent. I just wish there was something equally as good to pair with it for a/s. Whipped out the old 26mm finest for a change in scenery. I forgot how much I like a badger, keeps encouraging to save up for an even better badger.",

You know you're getting old when one of your friends says \"I'm pregnant\" and you say \"congratulations\" rather than \"oh shit. What happened?\"\n\nA ripped open single pregnancy test in the parking lot of a grocery store definitely has all the markings of \"oh shit\" rather than \"congratulations.\" For a second there, I went back and thought about some of those pregnancy scares when I was a young dude...and I got the heebie jeebies.\n\nSo all you good looking, good smelling, well-shaved young cats out there, buy condoms in those big boxes from Sam's, so you won't have to be buying your chick an off-brand single pregnancy test.\n\nIt ain't a good look.",

At this point, I'm guessing I have the softest water around because i never have any problem whipping up a good lather. The #3 setting is mild enough that I can shave rapidly and not really worry about technique. Which is perfect for a busy middle-of-the-week shave.\n\nI received the 2oz tin as part of a trade a while ago and shaved with it for the first time today. The scent was very mild for me though so I'm not quite sure what to make of it. Quite likely I'll trade/pass it on to somebody.",

The pic was after 4-5 swirls to load and doesn't include all of the lather on my head. It covered 3 more passes (another head pass and two on the face). I do have to load a little longer with other soaps (Storybook is really soft), but this lather is typical with most brushes I use (24-30mm).",

It's an old palace of sorts that's converted into a hotel. Gets reasonably cheap during the off season (which is now because of the heat and humidity).\n\nSometimes it's better to not travel in the off season. There's a reason no one else does it. My son is unfortunately dealing with the heat very poorly today. He puked twice (once in bed) and didn't eat anything at dinner. I really hope he feels better soon. I feel miserable for putting a little 16 month old toddler through this heat, even though he looked like he was really having a lot of fun!\n\n\n:(\n",

It also pairs really well with the blood orange scale polish, it is one of the listed notes after all.\n\n\n- The famous Maggard V3A razor (thanks again secret gifter!) This thing lived up the hype for sure and may just be the one to drag me kicking and screaming into the world of modern razors. If I were to compare it to one of my Gillettes it would be the old type, but maybe even smoother.",

Few weepers below the bottom lip where I did too many ATG passes. I think I finally understand this brush now. I've been splaying it too much because I'm used to the synthetic which is more spring-y and requires more force to splay. I don't think fan brushes want to be splayed all that bad because then your skin just makes contact with the hairless donut in the center. Using it very gently like I'm applying makeup to my face seems to work well. Still not a fan though.",

I am thinking it's more intuitive for me to keep close to the correct angle because I can basically just aim to keep it pretty flat with my face. The weight of this razor is also much lighter than the Rockwell 6s so I think that might be easier to me to keep the pressure light.\n\nThis was not a BBS shave, but it was pretty close. My face is feeling pretty good and any irritation that was visible after my shave went away with the Nivea.\n\nStirling island man is a great scent. I guess I'm going to need to expand my vocabulary in terms of describing the scent, but I guess I'd describe it as floral and clean. My wife said that she loves how the scent fills the bathroom for a while after my shave.\n",

It has tonnes of backbone which makes face lathering a dream but its tips are very soft at the same time. Release is good and it doesn't seem to eat the lather which is a nice bonus for a new brush. Unfortunately the badger funk hasn't completely gone after being left lathered in some Submariner for half an hour. It's only just noticeable though so it didn't detract from the awesomeness of the Pêche.\n\nEven better shave with the Blackbird this time round. BBS and no irritation.\n\nHave a good day guys :)",

My flight departs 5:30am, which means to get to the airport on time I need to leave about 3-ish. I stayed up until about 12:30 working on a photography project. Thought \"ill take a nap, wake up at 2:15, shower, shave, and be good to go.\"\n\nI WAS WRONG FAM. Nap was an awful idea. My alarm went off at the deepest part of my REM cycle. Damn I'm groggy. I should have just stayed awake.\n\nThe shave was great, though. Soap Commander Refreshment, I'm headed to Georgia, so I figured sweet tea was appropriate. 2-pass, comfortable shave. Got to the airport with plenty of time to spare.\n\nI had a picture for the SOTD, but imgur is fighting me, so RIP.\n\nI apologize for any formatting errors. Never posted on mobile before.\n\nAnyway, you guys won't hear from me until Monday, so have a great weekend.",

Handle by g_huck, malachite in a shape I'm not sure there is a name for. The knot definitely is scrubbier than B1 and B2, but it's most similar to B2 I think. Hopefully it softens a bit as it breaks in, but as is I'd say it is right at my scrub threshold.",

Apart from that, everything else is exactly the same as yesterday. This new LE brush is breaking in faster than any other Semogue I own by an order of magnitude. It's the only brush I've used since it arrived. I've been using it exclusively so as to break it in quicker. I think I can back off a bit. I'll use something else on the weekend...maybe.

Why did you do a cold water shave f1gnuts? Funny story other f1gnuts, if anyone read my sotd yesterday, I mentioned the hot water handle in the sink had a pretty loud noise to it. So like any new homeowner who isn't very handy, I took a run at fixing it. After more time than it should have taken I had fixed it! But then I noticed that the valve under the sink that I had shut off was dripping. After playing around with that for a bit, I couldn't fix it, so hopefully the plumber will come today, not charge an arm and a leg, and I will be able to use hot water again.\n\nP.S.

I've had this soap for quite some time and I think I neglected it because it's vegan. I think Wholly Kaw's vegan can go up against the best of the best. However, I do think his tallow and ASS MILK formulas are improvements over his vegan formula.\n\nThe scent on this also steered me away from it. It's very light and just smells, soapy. Out of the scents I can mostly only pick up vetiver and tonka bean. I can't get much else from it. It's very pleasant don't get me wrong but it just smells like a clean soap scent.\n\nI hope everyone has a great shave and day today!",

I have to say as a whole, Creed is definitely not worth the price. I've been just as impressed with much, much cheaper fragrances. That said, I have yet to smell something I enjoyed as much as the first couple of minutes Aventus is on my skin- the pineapple is so crisp you can almost taste it.",

I love the earthy, sweet scent that I get off this sample. This fougere is definitely right up my alley, where its not overly earthy or dank. Again performance needs no mention as it is MLS. Another winner from MLS and yet another soap I need to add to my den. Also, added a drop of TSD M-Bomb to the sample prior to loading up. Definitely felt a slight coldness during the shave but nothing crazy. Might add 2 drops next time to step it up :)\n\n\n\nAlso, first go with the Black Hawk V2 and this is a HUGE step up compared to the V1. I started my first pass and I thought I didn't even have a blade in the razor. Super smooth compared to the V1 with the same efficiency. Don't really care for the handle for the V2, especially considering the weird knob that you can twist off on the end. I believe its to give you the option for a shorter handle, but its not going to make the handle THAT much shorter. Overall, V2 > V1.\n\n\n\n\nShoutout to /u/Hughmonstah & /u/whiskyey for helping me with this concoction of an AS lol. Picked up some Cedar & Saffron FO from Brambleberry & got the unscented CL toner from Hugh. I absolutely feel in love with the Cedar & Saffron scent that SC used for their Gratitude soap, so I needed to get an AS with the same scent. Smells wonderful and of course its in my favorite AS/Toner base the man, the myth, the legend /u/hawns. Smelling good :D\n\n\n\n\n**Have a great shave everyone!!**",

Wound up getting an extremely close shave with the first pass. Did a clean up against the grain and got BBS in 2 passes. I was surprised how well this razor shaved my chin. I always struggle with that area with the 34C. Absolutely no burn with alum, very nice shave.\n\nI'm not one for alcohol based aftershaves, but I had a sample of the Reserve Classic, figured I'd use it with the soap. I really like the scent, and it's not quite as drying as others I've used, but I still had to use face lotion. The Montblanc Legend pairs perfectly with this scent!",

Surrounded by some cool palaces, and even has a lake palace in the middle of the lake.\n\nWe went for a boat ride after visiting the city palace of Udaipur. It was a nice day, but still humid AF. Never thought I'd be happy to see pouring rain, but it was a relief and it helped cut the humidity a bit!\n\nBest part is that my son didn't puke again. He's much better and he had a pretty good time today!\n\nHave a nice day y'all! :)",

      "body": "http://i.imgur.com/XlZInuc.jpg\n\nRazor: Rockwell 6s (4+2)\nBlade: Personna Lab Blue\nBrush: Stirling Finest Badger Fan 24\nLather: Stirling\nAdditional Care:\nNivea Sensitive skin post shave\n\nI have been thinking about dropping the Rockwell and focusing more on SE razors. Before I do that I've been finding myself wondering if it's the right call so I keep going back to the Rockwell to check - Today I had a great shave with it.\n\nBefore I started, I went back and checked out some YouTube videos from Ruds Shaves and Michael Freedberg for some inspiration. The first thing that I noticed was that their shave angle was a lot steeper than what I've been doing. I've been tending to try to ride the cap more and it seemed like they were riding the bar more than I was. The other thing that Michael did was use plate 4 for wtg and xtg and turned it over to plate 2 for atg so that he could do more of a buffering style of shave for the last pass.\n\nArmed with these technique changes that I wanted to try, as well as the practice using lighter pressure that I've had using the gem jr SE, I lathered up Stirling Mountain Man and gave it a go.\n\nThe result was pretty damn good. Bbs in most places with a few spots that I could have touched up if I really wanted to but didn't want to risk irritation by trying. This shave was closer than yesterday's with the Gem, but it does come with a touch more of a harsh lingering feeling on my skin that I think came from a few angle slips where the blade grabbed onto the hair rather than cutting.\n\nStirling Mountain Man smells nice. I'll say again that I don't really describe scents very well, but I guess it's a little woodsy. I haven't used a soap that I don't like yet but if I had to critique it, I *think* I would prefer if it were a little stronger of a scent.\n",

Barbershop kinda made my skin feel funny today for the first time ever, not sure why. It felt like I'd just had a harsh shave while the soap was on my face, but I didn't even start shaving yet. I think the soap could've probably taken a bit more water also. On my second/third pass I added more and the slickness was better. I'm still getting acquainted with the badger brush, but I think I finally reached a turning point and am starting to like it more. Definitely digging the new method of not splaying the fibers too much.\n\nI missed out on two SRs on eBay this week. A <$20 Pearlduck and a $15 W&B bow. Both were pretty rusty, but they were a great price for a restore job damnit! When I have time I think I'll give honing the Hejlestrand another shot. I do like the nimbly-bimbly feel of it.",

Maple Sugar beard oil\n* **Cologne**: Azzarro Night Time\n\nI switched out my open comb head for my old V3A - I wanted a single-pass (with cleanup) shave today. It turns out, I love that head on the MR5 handle. I had originally gotten the V3A with the \"matching\" MRG handle, which is now my wife's razor handle. After trying out more handles now, I think I would like the MR14 if I wanted a \"matching\" handle, but that's not really a priority. The MR5 in blue is tempting me, though.\nThis head has worse tolerance for blade alignment than the open comb v2, but after a gentle push with my fingernail, the blade aligns and it's ready to be tightened and shaved with. I believe my next head will be the iKon X3 Slant for my venture into the slant market.\n\nForged remains a decent performer. I would really only want to change the post shave feel and the scent. I'm determined to go through this sample and get back to my regular rotation of soaps.\n\nOnward to the beard oil. I have both the balm and oil of their [Maple Sugar](https://www.alpinebeardcompany.com/collections/all-beard-products/products/maple-pack) scent, and wow. These Canadians have made the perfect maple syrup scent. Wolverine and Deadpool would be proud.\n\n\n\n\nWait, what's that in the background, you ask? Could it be my new [Omega Mixed Midget](http://www.maggardrazors.com/product/omega-11047-mixed-midget-badgerboar-shaving-brush/) badger/boar brush? Oh yes. It's currently being [broken in](https://www.badgerandblade.com/forum/threads/how-to-break-in-a-brush-get-the-funk-out.139297/) by [OSP's](http://ospsoap.com/osp-shaving-soap/) Peppermint & Rosemary. Hopefully the combination of tallow, lanolin, kaolin, shea, coconut oil, and avocado oil will soften the bristles up just enough for it to be left slightly scrubby. The brush did build up a beautiful lather on its first use. I'm very excited for tomorrow's shave.",

The Zenith and the Stirling have similar bristles, but the knots appear to be quite different. The stirling knot has a more bulbous shape. It is also set a little deeper, yet still has a glue bump that's comes out twice as far as either of the other brushes. I don't think the Stirling brush is going to have any lack of backbone, even after being well broken in. All three of these have been put into water, and are chilling in the fridge. I figure with three new boars, I'll need all the skipping I can manage on break in time. We'll see how well this cold water thing does.\n\n\n\nHave a good one.\n\n\n\n*Update: Final day for entry and no one managed a golden ticket style pile of entries.\n\n\n\nI'm going to give the lather pic of the day to /u/nick47h for [this](http://imgur.com/X2VxySj) very clean looking lather shot, but I think I'll award a second set of points to /u/Mosquito_Valentino to help cover what is bound to be an extremely high [water bill](https://imgur.com/a/t704r) :)\n",

Got the Baili from the Groomatorium and the LGC set from the bazaar in the mail yesterday. This was my first go with LGC and a scent that I've been waiting some time to get my hands on. Overall, it's a great scent but not one that lived up to the lofty expectations I had. There is something in there (right now I'm leaning labdanum) that I don't quite care for, but it hardly ruins the scent. In the aftershave, I got a whiff of cinnamon that turned the scent almost divine. We'll see how this EdT wears throughout the day. I'm a huge fan of the citrus (bergamot and lime) notes that peak through whatever musty note that is I don't like.\nAlso, this razor is fabulous. It doesn't have the weight or build quality of a SS razor, but the tolerances seem good and it gave an effortlessly close shave. I hear the 3 piece designs are even better, so I might have to pick one up for only 6 bucks! I will definitely be keeping Baili as my travel razor from hence forth, not caring about the cost of replacement.",

I was able to use my RS set (been waiting on the AS to arrive) and I must say its a good scent. Not my favorite Rose scent (YRP and Rose Concerto have the top 2 spots) but definitely in the top 3. In other news, been listening to Linkin Park pretty much non-stop since I heard of Chesters passing yesterday. Linkin Park introduced me to nu-metal/rock music and influenced a lot of the music I know listen to today. My first concert that I attended was LP, back in middle school with my dad. Great night, although the next morning sucked due to having the shits from eating the damn stadium nachos lol. RIP Chester.\n\n\n**Have a great shave everyone!**",

My 2nd favorite thing about it is that I get to smell like a garden.\n\nThis Stirling boar brush has a lot of potential, especially at its price point. Mine did shed a large number of bristles during last night's initial de-funking and today's lather, but it performed really well otherwise. Based on my first impression, I'd recommend it as an inexpensive option if you're interested in checking out a boar brush and don't want to drop substantial coin.\n\nHappy Friday all. It didn't get here fast enough for me.",

Had a parcel with a bunch of new blades to try from Tryablade waiting for me. First time using the polsilver blade. Amazing experience with it. I found it to be a sharp and very forgiving blade, if i applied a bit to much pressure I did not end up with tugging or razor burn. I also found it cut through a months worth of growth with ease. I am preparing to order a bunch more but need to test some of the other ones I just bought first. I still want to try out some Asco reds, Shark Super Stainless, Voskhod, Sputnik and some Astras to find which ones I like best. The straight razor will probably be sitting on the shelf for a while until I am done testing the blades I just got.",

First use with the Maggard B&W knot. First, it lost 14 fibers - which seems pretty unusual compared to the other Maggard knots I have (22mm regular synth brush, 30mm regular synth knot). Hopefully it's just some loose fibers. Second, the dye started to leach out from the knot. Not sure if you can tell from the SOTD pic, but the lather has a blue-grey tint. Here's a pic of [the tub after loading](http://i.imgur.com/Mb5WYO6.jpg) and here's [the rinse water after the first pass](http://i.imgur.com/zx8s5gr.jpg) (I know, I know - [ew](https://gfycat.com/palesatisfiedalaskanhusky)). I'm sure the knot will be fine - just never had this happen with other black knots.\n\nI think we need indigo-dyed, [radioactive Japanese boar](http://www.cnbc.com/2017/03/10/radioactive-wild-boars-have-taken-over-two-japanese-towns.html) knots - the raw selvedge denim of brushes.",

I'd read the hype, of course. \"Sharpest blade ever,\" \"cut you from the next room,\" etc. I'd also read plenty of \"counter-hype\" saying it was just another blade, nothing to be afraid of.\n\nI honestly feel bad feeding into the cliche, but this thing was *sharp*. It flew through the shave with practically no resistance, even ATG, to give me one of the easiest near-BBS shaves I've had since I started wet shaving. It also left me bleeding in half a dozen places, more than one of which required the styptic pencil. So this was simultaneously the best and worst shave so far. I'm really not sure how to feel about the blade, but I'll give it another few tries.\n\nOn another note, Rose Santal is still pretty great. It's not my absolute favorite scent, but it's the one that feels the most \"me\". Rose and spice is a good signature for me, and I may have to get the EdT (and possibly try a couple other rose/spice frags).",

Beautiful views from a place we went to for lunch!\n\nAlso, I saw a number of **[these really old school perfume shops](https://imgur.com/a/jTMm1)** selling probably pure essence of various flowers. Very pricy too!! Thought /u/jdubba and /u/hawns would get a kick out of that!\n\nTravel day tomorrow!",

Quick and easy shave today, everything performed admirably. Haven't used this razor in a while and it felt as good as ever. Quick, comfortable and efficient.\n\nThe soap was new to me and I really liked it, the scent was pleasant and it wasn't overpowered by the menthol. I've wanted a straight citrus soap for a while and this is it. I could barely feel the menthol on the first pass but there was a nice cooling sensation, on the second pass it was a little cold and on the third pass it was quite cold. This was perfect for me since I'm not really a fan of strongly mentholated soaps. My face did feel very cold for a few seconds when I applied aftershave though. As for the performance, it's everything you would expect from CRSW. Thanks /u/DuncanPlums!\n",

Just enough scrubbiness, and the boar/badger mix allowed it to build a great, slick, wet lather with about a 30 second soak. Don't worry, it was ~~done the only way a lather should be made~~ a face lather.\n\nI switched back to the open comb to both prepare for Austere August and to avoid a bloodbath from the Feather's first shave.\n\n[Cold River Soap Works](https://www.coldriversoapworks.com/) is probably my favorite artisan soap makers. I'll be switching to the Fall Limited Edition for Austere August. After that, I'll be picking up their Select Le Chypre Sombre.\n\nL&L's aftershave liniment is the best aftershave I've ever used, bar none.\n\nGeo F. Trumper's Spanish Leather is *my* favorite cologne.\n\nLooking forward to grilling today! Expect this to be updated with a grilling pic this afternoon (US Eastern time).",

Stirling soap base really agrees with my skin. It took me a few times to get it dialed in, but now that I have it down, I get a comfortable shave every time.\n\nI finally put the Semogue LE down to start running through my numerous other brushes. If you haven't tried a 40033, for ~$7 it's a surprisingly good brush.\n\nI'm still diggin' on the NEW Deluxe. I'm having a hard time finding motivation to use another DE. Enjoy the weekend.",

TL;DR: It made my face break out in hives for about 30 minutes.\n\nThanks to a generous sample from /u/vigilantesd, I've been afforded the opportunity to see if it's their cream formulation itself that was fucking with me, or something in the frag. Thank you again, man! By the way, yours is in the mail today. I'll hit you up with the tracking info in a bit.\n\nI'm happy to report that I saw no ill effect from the cream this morning, and I think I like the citrus scent even more than that of *Lavender & Vetivert.* Good shave, all around, and the bright citrus is a nice offset to the dreary day that's shaping up here.\n\nEnjoy your Saturday, all. Time to drink some coffee and chill in my hammock for a bit.",

It's a beatiful piece of craftsmanship. The APSCo mixed knot is very interesting. Lots of back bone, for quite a bit of scrub. The tips are very soft, but the boars make themselves known with a very subtle scritch. Not something I'm usually a fan of, but it's quite interesting here and not at an unpleasant level. It's also something I feel like won't last as the boar bristles split. This knot has a lot of promise.\n\n\n\nHave a good one.",

Conk gets, this wasn't the worst shave. The blade on the other hand was not very good. On the plus side, I smell like a lime Lifesaver now.\n\nToday is going to be a good day!",

I am still learning the brush but am reasonably confident that building a good lather will be just a fluid as with the 49 and my other boars. My initial thought is it would be better with a bit shorter loft.\n\nFirst shave with this New Improved (Silver plated one). A good smooth head shave, but it took 3 passes to get the same results as 2 passes with my Schick J or E Type.\n\nBox of 12 Arko sticks for $21 = a shit ton of head shaves.\n\nHave a great shave.\n\n\n",

I just did the cheeks. This is the smoothest razor I've used yet. Shaving with a SR felt awkward and dangerous, but there was no blood so I count it as a success. Tabac really dried out quickly and was sticking to the blade, so I need to find a better soap, use pre-shave oil, or rethink how I lather up Tabac. It would have been way easier with more slip.",

At first I was a bit concerned it would be too small as I find my sweet spot is between 26 and 28mm, however, during use these concerns were thankfully quashed. The fan shaped knot obviously contributes to the increased face feel but I honestly feel like there's something else at play. What that is I'm not quite sure. The tips are fantastically soft and luxurious which is amplified by the knots conservative backbone although there is enough to exert a touch of scrub.\n\nThe Tiki isn't the easiest soap to load as the container is only a couple of inches wide and usually I have to revisit between passes but the Ranger easily picked up enough soap during the initial load and held enough lather for the entirety of the shave. Needless to say, I am rather fond of this brush.\n\nHave a good day people.",

Now I'm going to wait to let them all dry thoroughly. I'm hoping that shocking them from really cold to really hot water, followed by the drying, leads to a huge pile of split ends. We'll see.

Had a few nicks here, but there but I'll sort out soon enough with a few more shaves. I had quite a smooth shave for a first time use, I can really see why the Gillette adjustable razors are so sought after.\nThe ming shi feels smooth on the head and really plows through the hair. The angle is really is easy to find so no problems there. The overall weight really pushes down on the wrist, but after a while it's not as noticeable.\n\nWatched Valerian at 10 this morning. I liked it a lot, although there were times when scenes felt longer than they should have been. And at times the acting could have been better.\nThat being said...the CGI on the other hand was fantastic!\nIt's definitely worth a watch if you like sci-fi and special effects. All in all I give it **7.5 out 10** .\n\n\n",

Usually I do across the grain on the chin the first pass, but I'm starting to do a bit more of a true with the grain instead to see how that works out. I'm fully in tune with my W&B now and know exactly how much pressure to use for a pretty damn good shave. I'm still doing the chin area fairly slowly, but it has been great for the past few shaves - no cuts! I even got down to 19m for the first time ever for a 2.5 pass shave. Fourth and Pine is my favorite CL product after trying almost every single one. Huge shoutout to /u/galanothmvp for the recommendation!",

Proraso works well enough but it can't take a lot of water in my experience. You won't be getting those very dense, creamy and slick lathers with this. It might be a little thin when you add enough water but it's slick and protective enough so I don't mind. The scent is great though, probably the only sandalwood scent I'll have.\n\nHappy shaves!",

I felt a strange and unusual tugginess that isn't normal for this brand. It must be a lemon. Before anymore damage was done, I had to change it. Good thing I had an easily accesible voskhod on hand from yesterday.\n\n\nGreat shave. The soap is incredible, the scent is beautiful and warm, the aftershave is hydrating and nourishing.

Crazy to think I'm that far only since February. Well today I decided to go back to my beginnings and bust out the Proraso white. It's the first time lathering it since I came across [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wicked_edge/comments/6n90mw/disappointed_in_proraso/), and I had no idea it contained menthol. Sure enough, during the face lather process, I made a conscientious effort to notice it and could definitely tell. I like it though, and now I have a new appreciation for it.\n\nShave was fantastic, best in a while. Zero irritation and dare I say, BBS?\n\nHope everyone had a great weekend!",

I took a lesson from Scoot and worked it over with a stiff plastic comb to try to get out most of the remaining loose bristles. Another 10 or so came out during that process. I guess it worked because none came out during the shave this morning. Seemed to work pretty well. Definitely stiff and a bit scritchy, but not too bad. I got plenty of lather for the shave, but it still feels pretty stiff, and is having trouble releasing. This one still needs some break-in.\n\nFor the soap I gave the Cool another use to see if it might be a contender for AA. I really like the updated base on the Reserve line, and the scent is good. It's also pretty flexible for fragrance pairings. I don't think though that it's one that excites me quite enough to want to use it everyday for a full month, so I think I'm going to scratch it from the list of options.\n\nSpeaking of fragrance. It's not part of the AA requirement, but I'm on the fence as if I'll include it or not. On the one hand, it's a nice way to change up the monotony. On the other, that monotony is part of nature of the challenge, so it feels like it should be included. If so I need to pick two of those as well, morning and evening.\n\n\n\nCurrent Contenders for Austere August\n\n* **Razor**: Guerrilla/GEM G-Bar/ER 1924\n* **Blade**: 7 OC Black / GSB / GEM PTFE\n* **Brush**: Hucklaration/CR Declaration/Dogwood Abyss APSCo Luxury\n* **Lather**: WK MfM/WK FB/THB LC/L&L Rose Santal/SBS Hook/L&L Mayflower\n* **Post**: Pair to Soap\n* **Morning Frag**: Pair to Soap\n* **Evening Frag**: CL GLS/CL Rose Santal/Cartier Dec. d'Un Soir/Amouage Lyric\n\n\n\nHave a good one.",

Lmao! But straights are challenging and a lot of fun. I did a 1 pass with my BBS-1 and a new Wizamet blade. Easy peasy. T+S Boreal had great performance and post shave. I didn't get much living forest. It was all mint. Good thing I love mint. :)\n\nCheers!\n\nSong of the Day: [Meatloaf \"I'd Do Anything For Love But I Won't Do That\"] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGalkLRdlOs)",

Fun day with a bunch of walking involved, but it was awesome. Hope to go back soon and make it to the Coin Op (right next to Barley)",

First shave in Philly! Finally had time to shave last night. Flew in Friday and just bought a bunch of shit from Costco and IKEA to furnish the apartment. Gotta wait till Friday for most of the furniture to come in. Orientation starts today and I just went through registration (got an hour and a half until orientation things start). Shit's starting to get real and I'm already missing home (definitely not as humid back in the bay). First time living in a city since I spent all my childhood and undergrad in the suburbs. Guess now's the time to try city life out I guess. It's finally hitting me that I'm starting med school and I just hope I'm up to par with my classmates..",

Got a nice, irritation free shave. I'm still trying to dial in the lather from the Chiseled Face base. It works just fine, but I know it can be better.\n\nMy zoologist sample pack showed up yesterday, so I'm giving Civet a try to see if I want to pick up the soap. So far I like it, but I don't know that I love it (and for the price of the soap, I would need to love it).",

Turned out really well. I won't make any comments on the performance of the soap, as I'd like to reserve that for rocket, but I'll just say I had a good shave. I will also say that I enjoy unscented soap more than I expected. Really allows you to appreciate the scent of the aftershave more.",

Super soft. Limited backbone. Made loading a firmer soap a little more work, but once loaded it made a superb lather. If you're in the market for an inexpensive boar, but don't care for scrubby brushes, this one is your guy. I really enjoyed using it, but especially after the scrubby brushes I've been using lately, it seemed to be lacking character a little. Would be a great choice for a day if I needed to be easy on my face.\n\nAlso my first go with the Noble Otter soap. Reminds me pretty heavily of Stirling's soap base. Very firm, and very thirsty. Lather came out great when hydrated though, and with Tallow and Lanolin there are no problems at all with post-shave. There's nothing in the base that makes it stand out among some of the outstanding formulations that have been releasing lately, but I don't have any complaints either. It's a solid performer. I would gladly pick up more from this artisan in the future if I saw other scent profiles that intrigued me. Speaking of their barbershop. It's somewhat familiar and unique at the same time. Probably the closest one I have in terms of scent would be Man From Mayfair. It's got a fairly powdery undertone from what I guess is oakmass, but it's not a sweet scent like the vanilla, violet powder of Stirling. It's also not an overly citrusy barbershop either. Some lemon comes out after lathering, but the primary top notes I get are aromatic, with hints of anise and rosemary. If you're a barbershop aficionado this one may be interesting to you.\n\n\n\nStill have no idea what AA choices I'm going to make...\n\n\n\nHave a good one.",

Not this dude, that's for sure.\n\nAnd a good thing, too: This is an absolutely lovely take on a tobacco scent: Warm, not cloyingly sweet, and the addition of amber really takes off the edge. As always, Stirling's performance is unimpeachable. This pairing very nearly classed me up, so I decided that I needed some Danny Brown in my life to offset that. Worked like a charm.\n\nEnjoy your Tuesday, all. Happy shaves!",

This soap always reminds me of fall, and the chill in the air that we have here right now pairs well with it.",

I didn't expect this much of a jump in quality until well over the $50 mark. Its pairing with CRSW's Spring makes for a beautiful lather and some of the best shaves I've ever had.\n\nBrokkr is a discontinued scent of honey and ale, and I am forever hopeful that it gets brought back. I'd prefer TTFFC to be the ones to do it, but I'd jump on any vendor selling that scent.\n\nIn other news, I haven't posted in a couple days because I ~~didn't wanna~~ have been busy enough to give up my time allotment for shaving. I did a quick shave yesterday afternoon, but I didn't bother with pictures or posting.\nI'm fairly certain that this will be my setup for Austere August. I'm keeping the Spring scent instead of Fall because I forgot how damn hot it stays in Atlanta compared to Iowa. I'll be doing the Extreme mode (one soap, one razor, one type of blade), and I'll also be killing my After the Rain aftershave in the interest of getting a new L&L liniment to better match the coming season.",

Really the lesser backbone with this brush then my Omega 49 is a first world problem. It means I have to load a bit longer which just forces me to spend a little more time relaxing and enjoying the process. Not sure why I'd even consider it a con.\n\nBeen a while since I have used the DR Harris soap. I know I shouldn't be surprised how good of a lather it provides but I was expecting lesser quality for some reason.....pleasantly wrong.\n\nI only have three splashes so far with menthol (though I plan to add menthol to most of the others) so, odd pairing or not, I grabbed the Man From Mayfair wanting to finish off with a touch of coolness.\n\nHave a great shave.",

I treated the cream loading like it was *Baume.Be* or *Cade Rich*. I listen to my personal mentor, Stirling Archer and followed his [example](https://youtu.be/jS4w5S-Jdb4)\nFANTASTIC cream! This stuff is the real deal. I hate that I am so bad with picking out scents, but this is another great scent (even though it was a limited edition). Great Wednesday shaves to all.",

I could ramble on and on about \"loving the scent\" and the \"story unfolding,\" but it's been done before, suffice it to say I like this soap a lot.\n\nI've been on antidepressants for almost 5 weeks now, and they've begun to have positive effects. My ups and downs have been less pronounced, and my wife and I have both noticed that I can work up motivation and stay focused much more easily. The only downside to this is focusing too much and spending five hours collecting, simplifying, and testing a plethora of damage equations from a certain videogame. Oops.\nGrilling again today, because it's my favorite way to make food.\n\nHave a great day and a great shave!",

Slightly firm and still a little scritchy. It's easy to tell from this shave that about 10-15 more shaves and this is going to settle out to be one hell of a brush. If the backbone stays where it is or eases just a little it's going to be just about right as those tips split and the overall feel softens. Also, it's a damn lather machine. I used my normal process this morning, and had lather going everywhere, and plenty of lather left over after the shave. This looks to be one impressive little brush once it fully breaks in.\n\n\n\nFinally locked in some Austere August choices. Decided go with the Dogwood/Chiseled Face combo for a chance at that sweet, sweet Chiseledphace Dogitorium brush. Still have to work out my frag choices, and right now I'm leaning towards only locking in my morning frag.\n\n* **Razor: GEM - G-Bar**\n* **Blade: Personna - GEM PTFE**\n* **Brush: AP Shave Co. - 24mm Luxury Fan, Dogwood Handcraft Abyss**\n* **Lather: Chiseled Face - Sherlock**\n* **Post: Chiseled Face - Sherlock**\n* *Morning Frag: Guerlain Vetiver/Dreamer/D&G PH/Lalique PH*\n* *Evening Frag: Dealer's choice/CL GLS/CL Rose Santal/Cartier Dec. d'Un Soir/Amouage Lyric*\n\n\n\nHave a good one.",

Its probably my favorite AdP clone out there right now. For the record, CB IdP is pretty damn awesome too.\n\nI can say that the Maggard two-band knot is pretty much broken-in now and whips ups a damn amazing lather with a face feel that's just awesome. Its luxury all the way. Finally, what can be said about Seascape handles that hasn't been said already? Its an all around amazing brush, that these days really only splits time with my G_Huck/Romera 30mm two-band jade brush. Even my beloved BSSW/MF 3XL doesn't see much use anymore, sadly. Note to self: spread the shaving love and use some other brushes! lol\n\nAll around great shave last night. Good day gents.",

Off the puck I got a synthetic/fake type scent. I didn't find it very appealing at first. During lather it sort of went away. The base is great but this may go to the bazaar. I'll give it a few more tries. I have Mike's Coconut, Haslinger's Coconut, a PAA something. I still need to try the Dapper Dragon but I wasn't a big fan of the base when I tried their samples a few years back. I smelled Stirling's Coconut Lime at the Groomatorium but I wasn't a big fan. I saw that WK had a seasonal fig and coconut scent. Dang missed out on that one. Oh well. Now I'm just waiting on my Nebula B3 Jefferson and Panda!",

It's a scent based off of Aqua Di Gio, the scent is good, and performance is excellent. The soap is a little hard to load though.\n\nI found a vendor on eBay that sells 37c top caps. I was so happy. The original top cap for the Apollo broke, and this 37c top cap fits perfectly. It is also lighter, and has a slimmer profile than the POMCO top cap I was using. Only down side is that this top cap is also made of pot metal.\n\nThis Semogue brush is breaking in nicely. It's getting softer with every use, and it's holding a lot more lather. It's become a real pleasure to use.\n\n\nHave a great day guys!",

The cream was easy to lather, but I slightly underestimated how much to use. Barely had enough for 3 passes. But the performance was quite good. I spent the morning trying to figure out the scent profile. I'll need another morning to reach a conclusion. Exceptional shave though, hardly any irritation and just on the cusp of BBS.\n\nLet's all hope for a great day. Work smarter, not harder.",

Figured I signed up to test it, may as well actually test it, lul.\n\nThis brush. Boy, it's a great boar brush, and it's broken in REALLY nicely for me, but I think it's a face lathering brush. I've recently been growing a beard and only shaving my head, and it's a bit scritchy for my scalp. Although, to be fair to the brush, I didn't really soak it for long this morning, I treated it a bit more like a badger brush, so it definitely had backbone for days. That could be part of it.\n\nI hadn't noticed it for some reason before, but the Calypso really has some great blade feel to it. I'm so used to the Rockwells which are heavy, so blade feel is minimal and smooth. The Calypso is so light and maneuverable, and when you hit the right angle, you get some nice blade feel. It's not scary aggressive. It's very controlled and just lets you know you hit the sweet spot, and that's pretty neat.\n\nAs another part of trying this soap, I'm going post-shave-less today. It's Thursday, so if my scalp hates it, I don't have to deal with people seeing the mess for the rest of the week, I'll have the weekend to get things to settle down. It's about an hour since I shaved as I type this, and so far, so good.\n\nAnyway, that's the end of the novel about my shave. Hope you gentlemen all have a great day and a great shave!",

None of the stuff I used today is my all-time favorite, but if I had to pick only one razor, brush, soap+as, and frag for the rest of my life, this would definitely be it. It's a really versatile set, so along those lines I'm thinking this is close to my Austere August set. That said, there's nothing austere about the ATT, so I may switch that out for either my Slim or my OCMM, if I get blades for it in time- expected delivery date is Saturday the 29th so here's hoping! Failing that I think a straight razor is as austere as it gets, so we'll see if I'm brave enough to use one exclusively for a month.",

I went with Maya first as that was the one I was most excited for from the get go. It starts off orangy and chocolaty (but not sweet), and then as you lather, it gets into the spiciness of the cardamom and allspice. Definitely will be using this more in the fall/winter. The new base performs very well also! Looking forward to trying the rest of the scents soon.",

Sadly, i still feel like it's a tad too aggressive for me. I was able to get BBS in a 2-pass (with and against) but I'm not sure I want to do that on a regular basis. I'm going to try a proper 3-pass the next time and see if it feels any better from a 2pass.\n\nFirst time shaving with a CB soap. Great all round performance. I was hoping for a different mango smell than I got though. Not yet sure how I feel about that yet but that's likely also because I don't have a matching A/S. At some point, when I narrow down all my soaps, I'm going to have to go on a matching A/s hunt for my single soaps.",

It's been a week since getting trimmed, so the beard needs more control.\n\nDr. Jon's \"Classic\" and \"Aphrodite\" were my first two shaving soaps, straight from the bazaar, that allowed me to toss out that Van der Hagen soap. I immediately loved Classic, which has just the best, strongest cedar scent I've smelled in a soap. I very nearly used the entire thing before trying other soaps and deciding I would save that first love for special occasions.\n\nWell, I just got a job that's going to land me three weeks in a trailer with limited water, free food, and the scorching Georgia sun for twelve hours a day for 2-3 weeks. I'll be four hours away from home, going miles away from said trailer with a camel back and weed eater to fuck up some grass and weeds sun up to sun down, going back to the trailer to shower, shave, and sleep. I figured that qualified me for my Delaware gold.\n\nWith all of that in mind, I'm going to change up my Austere August set to use my Suavecito Sandalwood cream and eucalyptus aftershave. I tend to be faster when lathering creams because I add just a little bit of water at a time, and creams require much less water.\n\nHave a good day and a great shave!\n\nEdit: Additional good news!\nI just weighed in at 188 lbs, down from 217 just three months ago. Today's a good day. I'm looking forward to bumping up my calorie limit from 1500 to 2030 for those few weeks of constant physical activity.",

Scent notes of 150: Castoreum + Tim Hortons Coffee + Cedarwood + Douglas Fir + Maple Syrup + Alberta Premium 'Dark Horse' Rye. Off the puck it's all Castoreum, but when lathering it really opens up. I picked up mostly Castoreum, dark coffee and Rye, with more woodsy notes coming through in the AS. Very nice, and something different! I also used a cool brush I just picked up - a vintage Ever Ready with a Declaration B2 24mm knot.

Hmmm... this blade may have to be revisited in a third round of 7 o'clock testing. It doesn't end! Only a tiny bit of irritation. After several years of DE shaving I have discovered something. I do one full wtg pass then just touch up until my face is smooth. Different parts of my face need specific techniques to get smooth. Running the razor over them in additional full passes doesn't really achieve much. Almost out of my Gillette cream. I enjoy the scent and performance but probably won't but another tube. I recently finished a large C. O. Bigelowe tube as well. End of an era as I've had both of those for years. Almost to the weekend!\n\n",

One weeper below the bottom lip. My WTG passes on the upper lip this time were a bit more easy, and my ATG passes were just alright. I think at least part of my speed increase as of late is due to giving less shits about chasing the perfect shave.\n\nI was starting to really like the badger more but this shave brought my feelings back to earth. It simply doesn't release lather as well as the synthetics, probably because it retains way more water at the \"bottom\" of the knot. However, I don't ever want to splay the brush that much on my touch-up pass because I don't want soap all over my face, so to get thicker lather I had to squeeze the bottom of the brush. Not ideal. Even the lather for the second pass was kinda sparse. I tried putting more water into the brush but it doesn't seem to help very much.",

I'm a fan. It's a very fresh scent, that seems bright enough to work in the summer heat, yet has some nice grounding elements that prevent it from becoming too thin and airy. Once again, I find myself really liking a fragrance coming from a wetshaving community artisan. I'd easily take it over a lot of the stuff I've picked up from traditional fragrance houses.",

Drove the oldest to summer camp in NH, and dropped off the youngest to in-laws in Canada. Wife and I will be alone for next 10 days. It will be nice.\n\nGreat shave, great smells, but the highlight of this shave is the towel I've used. Found that in the attic at my grandparents' house in the countryside. My grandmother, who died in 1988, wove those towels for my grandfather and uncles for years apparently (and also used as dish clothes). The weaving loom is still in the attic. Pretty cool. So I grabbed a few towels on my way out. Absolutely no value added to the shave itself, but the sentimental component is huge.\n\nHappy Friday everyone.",

This brush is just getting better and better. Really softening up nicely but still holding that good backbone. Thanks to /u/Devilsmaycry1974, I tried a new soap today, L&L's Cuir et Epices. It's described as: *\"This is what I imagine John Wayne's kitchen smelling like - soft leather, vaguely appley, with a twist of some kind of baking spice.\"* That's right on. Leather and apple pie. So good!! Thanks DMC! I'm really enjoying this and will have to pick some up. I have a big Irish wedding to attend this afternoon. Should be fun!",

We're going to do a \"test cut\" tomorrow, and if we get the job, I'll be in a trailer with a couple of other guys for three weeks, several hours' driving away from home. And heyo, no wife + working sunrise to sunset? Cologne would be a waste. I'm guessing the beard care shtuff might even be a waste, but I do want to keep it as soft as it has been (think steel wool vs...softer steel wool).\nAnywho.

Not in the mood to face lather today, not with an unbroken-in boar anyway, so I took out my now long forgotten Turkish copper bowl and proceeded to load the brush twice.\n\nAfter loading the brush sufficiently, I gently took out the soap, put it into the bowl, proceeded to relather again, mixed them into the bowl and proceeded to bowl lather properly, with drips of water until it's the perfect consistency.\n\n\nI have enough for three passes, while I have a contingency for the boar eating my lather. It was perfect. I wasn't in the mood to palm lather after the 2nd pass, I also have another gout flare up today, the longer I stand the more discomfort.\n\n\nWorked perfect, and this soap can definitely take the onslaught. Like many triple milled French soaps we know, this is a hard puck and this kind of heavy loading is nothing but a scratch for this soap. I didn't even make a dent.\n\n\nShave was excellent, face feels wonderful and in my mind the 2x load might have also accelerated the break-in process just a tad more than my usual routine.\n\n\nThe bowl. This is why I usually don't get rid of my stuff. Hidden gems.\n\nCheers",

I knew it was coming, but I was still surprised nevertheless. In spite of my insistence otherwise, /u/I_Like_a_Clean_Bowl sent me an early B-Day gift to help mark my milestone B-Day next month.\n\nI've been meaning to get a Zenith for some time, but never got around to doing it. Out of his generous nature, Mr. Bowl got me a Zenith boar and a tub of Cella. Thanks Mr. Bowl. I appreciate it very much.\n\nSo what people generally have stated about these brushes is that they are good right out of the box. My experience reflects that. There was virtually zero funk to wash out too. For the sake of habit, I did a couple of defunking palm lathers then let the bristles soak in water over night. It performed great on its first use. I'm going to be using this every other day for a while to get it broken in.\n\nEvery time I use a Tech I am amazed at how well this humble razor shaves. Some of the best shaves are with a Tech and today was no exception.",

I caught the fever, and had to find out what all the Col. Conk buzz was all about. Did it live up to all that buildup? Not really. It is pretty much universally panned, but I didn't find it to be some terrible thing. The Scent was very light. This was probably my biggest complaint on the soap. Because it was dense and hard, it took a little more time loading than normal. The final lather was not that soft, creamy and unctuous lather you can really pull out of a good artisan soap. In the end though, it had plenty of slickness, minimally acceptable residual slickness and a post-shave that isn't just terrible. Is it something I'm going to keep reaching for? Probably not, but if I was on a tight shaving budget, this stuff is cheap as dirt and fully functional, although it's probably not the ideal soap to learn with. My lathering process had to adapt a bit to get it to that functional state, and it's not something you would be able to do easily if you're just starting out and don't have experience working with lather.",

Not sure if the blade needs to be replaced already or if I just didn't have enough growth for this razor. Lather was great, I love the performance of the PdP. I busted out the alum block for the first time in a long time, it gave me lots of feedback that I had quite a rough shave. Added a generous amount of CL salve to sooth the skin. I'll probably skip tomorrow to let my face recover.\n",

Great shave today. I fucked up the angle with the Slim last time, so I was doing more scraping than shaving. Today's shave was much better.\n\nMarshlands is an amazing scent, and I'm sad that it's discontinued...though my tub is still almost full. I thought I underloaded my brush a little bit, but as I built the lather, I realized this may have been the first time I didn't *overload* an L&L soap. Still had enough lather for about four passes lol. The post shave feel of the bison formula is insane. So soft.\n\nMLS Reunion is part of the wonderful and generous package I received from my gift exchange partner. It is exactly what I was looking for - a brighter vetiver aftershave. I have CL's LQV, which is an awesome scent, but a bit dark for sunny summer days. Reunion keeps that nice vetiver forward scent, but it's brighter and crisper.\n\nHope you all have as good a shave as I did today!",

I used a Wade & Butcher 11/16 HH \"Bow Razor\", which I really enjoyed. There seemed to be less dragging and irritation this go. I used a few skin stretching techniques I learned after watching several Mastro Livi videos, which helped. For the soap, I used a sample of T+S Morocco. It is fantastic!!! Nice and smoky with floral elements. Very relaxing, which is just what I needed for this straight razor shave. I paired with Shag AS. Have a great day everyone!",

The sr went pretty smooth for my first time, though I did nick my ear pretty good. After that I finished up and touched up with the merkur 23c I got in the pif as well. So far, the 23c is much smoother for me than the 34 that I had, and the razorock with semogue brush lathers so much better than the prorasso I had with a 10$ omega brush. Thanks again u/greatblackowl!",

I ain't shittin ya. I get the best post shave feel with this soap. More so than any other soap I own. Others come close, but this one clearly gives me the best post shave feel.\n\nBack to the LE brush. I am glad I got in on this because this brush shot to the upper reaches of my brush list right out of the box and it will only get better with use. I have about 15 shaves with it now, and the tips are splitting nicely.\n\nAnother shave with the lowly Tech and another close and comfortable shave it was. Ima use the Tech for a few more shaves just to remind me that it deserves my admiration for being a good razor. A shit ton of work awaits me outside.",

No idea how V2 corresponds to their current lineup of bases, so I wouldn't know what to order if I wanted more like this. The scent was super light, to the point of almost not being there. Smelled clean and pleasant at least.\n\nI'm packing up all my stuff to move into an apartment with my gf, and today I put all of my shaving soaps and aftershaves and stuff into a box. It was kind of embarassing how big and full the box is...but money will be much tighter once I move out, so I'm glad I stocked up now!",

I'll likely do a couple test lathers during the month to see how it compares against my AA soap (which is gonna be Chiseled Face/Zoologist Panda). This soap has treated me well, though.\n\nIf we are all just addicts chasing the high of BBS, boy I got high AF this morning. 2-pass shave and both passes just felt glorious. This GSB just continues to surprise me. It almost feels better with each shave, which is giving me some good confidence heading into AA as I plan to do the Ultra-Hard-Mode rules.\n\nI hope you all had/have a great shave this morning, and I hope you've had yourselves a great weekend as well. I'll see you guys back on Tuesday morning for the kickoff of AA.",

The GEM was super smooth, I did just one pass in preparation for Austere August but it mowed down stubble pretty efficiently save for on my neck. No nicks or irritation, which surprised me given its fearsome reputation. Star Noir is a weird soap: the base isn't as nice as B&M but it lathers easily. The scent profile is weird, weird weird: almost repulsively green off the puck, but there's a sweetness and spice that rounds it off nicely when wet. Overall, both of these are keepers- shame I won't get to use them again for a month!",

I did a search on r/wetshaving and didn't turn up any results. Picked up a rather generous sample from them during the St. Louis meetup.\n\nIf you aren't familiar, their base is an unscented soap which you then add however much scent you want (in the form of oil). They recommend starting around four or five drops of a fragrance which can also double as a pre-shave. Basically it lets you control how strong a specific scent is.\n\nThe shave and scent of Casino Royale were good for me, but I'm no reviewer so I'm curious to see what others think!",

I quite liked the menthol in the soap, though am not sure about the scent. Honestly, I wasn't blown away by the scent during the shave and so I was sorta glad I hadn't gone crazy in chasing this set down. Not sure if having the A/s might have changed my mind. Fortunately, I have enough left-over for another shave. We'll see how I feel about this after that.\n\nI was tempted to go with CL's Champs de Lavande for the post but I quite liked the menthol in the soap so Soap Commander it is!",

I'm now ready for a month of austerity, in which I will be positively slumming it with an AP Shave Co. luxury knot, Guerrilla razor and B&M's glissant base.\n\nHeh, that's some austere setup, amirite? Hey, it fits the definition of the challenge, and gives me a chance to really break in my mixed knot and put a good dent in my tub of *42,* so I'm sticking with it.\n\nHappy Monday, all.",

It's all newly remodeled, which is awesome, but my bathroom is sans mirror. I bought a medicine cabinet from Ikea, but haven't had time to put it up yet. So I got a makeup mirror from Target and tried to shave and do my hair with it. Man, that was something else.\n\nLooking forward to getting my delivery from Ikea on Thursday, because I set up a futon down in the scent cave, but the only seats I have upstairs are dining room chairs and a mattress on the floor. There's nothing less rewarding after spending the whole weekend moving stuff and walking up and down stairs, all the while forgetting to duck in the basement and hitting your head, then stretching out on a nice wooden chair and enjoying a cold Busch Bavarian. Or laying on a mattress on a floor like a junkie squatter.",

This all meant that we were re-negotiating and\ntl;dr the groundskeeping supervisor has to get approval for the new price/acre for us doing all of the harder work, and I'm back home with only mildly sore arms, legs, and back.\n\nTo celebrate, I didn't. Because I wanted that money. I started Austere August early. I quite enjoy the slight menthol that Suavecito added to their sandalwood cream. The scent of the cream is outstanding and will last for a couple of hours, but it's also sandalwood, so it smells great with most things.\n\nI'm still loving this brush. Looking forward to re-perfecting the water/soap ratio on Suavecito's cream now that I'm using this brush instead of the old synthetic. Can't decide if I want to sleep the day away or grill for a bit, but I'd need to get groceries. We aren't stocked with meat since my wife's a vegetarian and I was planning to be away for a few weeks.",

I really enjoyed it! The lather quality was great, and it stayed well hydrated. The scent was awesome and put me in a tropical mood, so I paired with B&M Bay Rum AS. Bay Rum!!! :D\n\nI also used an M&F/Sears 2XL, on loan from /u/vigilantesd (Tyvm!!). This was much softer than I was expecting and was really nice. The size was perfect, it splayed well and made crazy good lather. Thumbs up!!\n\nHappy shaving everyone!\n\nSong of the Day: [Donovan \"Mellow Yellow\"] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64mb_hUOb4g)",

It's an intoxicating combo that leans heavily on grapefruit. I'm not an expert at lathering it yet as I don't include it in the rotation quite that often and it definitely lathers differently that most of the tallow-based soaps in my collection, but I absolutely love it.\n\nThe highlight of this shave though is the Dr Jon's AS tonic. I wish the scent were a bit stronger, but the combo of ingredients as well as the citrus smell makes the starting of the week a good one.",

My girlfriend and I went to see Korn (and Stone Sour and Skillet) last night, so we got home pretty late. Of course that led to sleeping in, which led to being busy all day finalizing things to start moving into our new apartment tomorrow. I've spent much of the day on the phone with insurance companies, the bank, and Comcast. It was nice to finally shower this evening, as I still smelled vaguely like the myriad of smokes which were wafting through the air at the concert.\n\nStirling's Glacial line is right on the border of what I can handle for menthol. The performance is still great of course, with a nice thick lather being disturbed only by the occasional tear rolling down my cheek. I think I prefer my menthol in my aftershave, but a good chilly soap is nice on occasion.",

My GSB is on its 6th or 7th shave and no tug with little irritation. Porch Drinks is different scent wise, tough to explain, but it is a great complex, manly robust scent. Five minutes later, and still cannot think of a comparison. 10/10 would recommend.",
