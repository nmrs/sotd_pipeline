I was lucky enough to be able to use a new B6 brush and something from B&M. I'm going to save comments on the soap until I can check in with Will on what exactly his expectations are.\n\nHowever, B6...well just check out those pictures and the hooking tips. That hooking is from 3 palm lathers! As always, Declaration continues to dominate all other competition in the brush market. There is simply no comparison to his knots. This batch has the super soft, gel like tips but a little more backbone than my B5 brushes. My late B5 brush has extreme hooking and a crispy dry to it. I'm fairy positive that B6 will be that way if not more, maybe it will dry in one big clump only time will tell. Better pick up some B6 while it's around, my guess is that it's going to go FAST, FAST, FAST once reviews start to trickle out.\n",

Northeast wind around 5 mph becoming southeast in the afternoon. High tide at 3:58 this afternoon.\n\nI decided to not buck tradition and use Adagio today. This scent is great, glad that I grabbed a back-up tub when it was announced it was being discontinued.\n\nThe knot is fantastic. The handle is a bit small for what I would like. Should not have used the Timeless for the head shave, but I was just so sick of using the Schick Grip that I needed a change of pace.\n\nHope everyone has a nice Saturday!",

I see why she loves it so much. The soap performed well enough. I mean, it got the job done and all, but it did lack a bit of cushion. Slickness was fine though and the scent is phenomenal. I made a very drastic mistake today though. I missed my straight so much I jumped right to it, even though I still had some irritation from yesterday's face scraping. Not a smart idea on my part. At least the cold burn of the cryogen took my mind off the morning's blunder. And I decided to throw the Le Grand Chypre on top for shits a giggles.\n\nWe've got a fair thing to go to this morning here in town. We have it every year the Saturday before Labor Day. Just your typical small town thing with booths of stuff nobody needs but everybody wants and food that's terrible for anyone to even look at, much less consume. So I guess it's about time to lasso the younguns and walk around until I can eat some deep fried Oreos. Hope everybody has a great day!",

I stumbled across one of their machine synthetic brushes on eBay for super cheap and I thought the brush looked really cool (still do). I won the auction, and the brush came with a few samples of their soap.\n\nThis is a really nice soap. I don't gravitate towards Bay Rum scents, so I can't really compare the scent to anything, but the soap is slick and protective. I would rate this soap just a little below the very highest performers, which was quite a shock from a company that doesn't seem to get talked about on here. So, this was a very pleasant surprise.",

After a quick test lather at work (don't ask), and a palm lather later in the evening, I was able to use it this morning for an actual shave. For context, I have used all 6 Declaration batches, and I own B2, B4, B5 and now B6.\n\nThe bristles on B6 feel stiffer and thicker to me than B5. Of course, B5 was somewhat of a unicorn in that regard. I'd place the thickness and feel closes to B4. It has more backbone to me than B5, but to my surprise, the tips on the brush were very, very soft. Perhaps the biggest surprise was that even after a test lather yesterday, the brush already started to hook, and developed a ton of gel. The gel is very noticeable already, after just two uses. So, it's an interesting combination of backbone, softness and gel. In terms of these things, it might be the most balanced batch I've tried. It also seemed to splay more than some of my other batches without feeling floppy, which I liked. I'm confident that this batch is going to have a lot of fans, especially those who like the gel-tip feel. If you've been waiting for the chance to grab a Declaration brush, B6 is absolutely a worthy addition to your den.",

Austere August is over and I've moved on to Seville September (not really, but alliteration). I've been staring longingly at the Seville Reserve for nearly a month, teasing me after my commitment to Noble Otter Barrbarr during the month of August. I've discovered what I already knew-I'm no one-soap-man. I need the variety and the feeling of something new and fresh. I'll go back to the Barrbarr (in its new and improved version), but first I need to explore my options.\n\nThe Reserve Seville was fantastic. Really, if I'm going to be honest, the soap performed about as well for me as the Glissant Seville proving that the older soaps still have a lot to offer. And the latter is readily available whenever I make that call. But the Reserve Seville aftershave is what knocked my socks off. I went for the GEM today since I had a forest of hair growing on my face since I ran out of Barrbarr a few days early and it is great at destroying three days of growth. I thought I was going to have some razor burn and thought I may have cut myself a time or two. My hair is so coarse that it feels like splinters in my face. In any case, a few splashes of that beautiful aftershave soothed my face and made me forget everything that has come before it. At least for a minute, I could see myself using this for the rest of my life. Or until the bottle runs out. Damn, it is nice.\n\nBut back to the soap. Despite the several days growth and feeling like I might have some razor burn, there was none. There was no burn when I put on the aftershave. Reserve soaps are deceptive in their greatness sometimes. They don't look like other soaps when lathered up but damn if they aren't beautiful and slick. Like I said before, I'm not sure there is a huge difference in terms of my preference for this over the regular Seville, but they are both unmatched in their awesomeness.\n\n[Beautiful Reserve Seville](https://imgur.com/gallery/9DLfSI4)",

So light, I thought it was going to be able to cut the hairs. The cuts on my neck tell me I'm wrong.\n\nNew razor, so it's going to take me a few to dial it in. Overall my face is incredibly smooth. So, no complaints!\n\nThe Soap and Splash are fantastic. First go with Talbot and it's really good. I see why Jason \"Ruds\" likes it so much. I didn't load a whole lot in to the brush but I still got a very slick layer of soap on my face. Also, this scent is fantastic. A great match for Jimmy Choo.\n\nI got work today, but afterwards my lady and I are going to the Street Fair in Orange, and watching Mile 22 tonight. Should be fun! Have a great day guys.",

Do I $10/ounce like it? Probably not. Thus, I will probably never have a tub of my own. But having the opportunity to shave with a sample helps with the FOMO and Bazaar Madness. A lot of people don't know that Bazaar Madness is a common comorbidity of both FOMO and the entire [S/R/B]AD family, but it's a proven medical fact. I read it in Lancet or something like that. Still, it was a nice shave and a good way to start off Sampletember. Also, after a solid month using an adjustable, it's tough to go to back to a regular razor. But Austere August is over and I've got new hardware coming so I need to get back to rotating.",

After getting a starter kit from maggards about a year ago, I went to Stirling and purchased a couple of samples to use with the new gear. I read a lot of people recommending Stirling for their larger than average samples at a great price point/quality. Upon receiving them, Ozark was definitely my favorite. Fast forward to today, and it is still one of my favorite scents. A great outdoorsy, fall, mountain smell, it also produces a great lather. Had a great shave today with it and followed it up with the matching aftershave sample.\n\nCompared to some/most of the people on this sub, I am very new to wetshaving. I have only been doing this for about a year now and don't have much gear at all. I use the same brush everyday and I use the same razor everyday. I would definitely like to purchase, upgrade, and try others, but for now, I felt that trying different soaps while keeping the hardware consistent was a better move. That way I keep my technique the same and can really get a feel for soaps.\n\nWith that said, I loved the idea of Sample September. Although I have minimal hardware, I do have a bunch of software samples I have acquired from artisans and maggards over the past year. My goal for the month is to use a different sample everyday while keeping with the theme, and just enjoy this as the first event I'm taking part in in this community. Cheers!\n",

This .67 seems deceptively efficient. So smooth while cutting really well! Reminds me of the UK Aristocrats, which have similar traits.\n\n**Razor and Blade Notes**\nGood combo! I got a very good shave but I think I wasn't careful enough with my technique along one jawline, and I really stirred up some irritation. Smooth, solid blade feel.\n\nMan, he's got this head geometry dialed in really well!\n\nAnd this Nacet is on use 34, and it's still kickin.\n\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Close Shave\n*Neck*: Few hairs are showing some tip length (with most being cut flush)\n\n**Soap Notes**\nOne of my favorite scents ever. And this puck gives me such great lather very easily. Great creamy feel and super slick.\n\nDid a 45 sec load with a brush med of water (looks like I should have kept all the water in it) and that was maybe twice as long as I needed. I couldn't remember how long I loaded for last time, so I played it safe. I did have to add more water to the lather because I had so much soap.\n\n\n**Brush Notes**\n2nd use of this brush and it was nice. Still a bit firm due to density, but splays much better than the first one I tried (which had a loft a bit too low). And due to the splay, lather generation is much better. As long as this guy relaxes/opens up over time, I think I'll be super happy.\n\n----\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger**\n\nUse this to document how long our blades last, if you want, and what about them made us pitch 'em. I created a Google Form with just a few questions:\n\n[Ending of Blades Ledger](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform)\n\n[The Ledger Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing) in case you want to just look at the data.\n\nI'll keep this as my footer each SOTD so you have the link. I'll take it down if no one shows interest.\n",

My technique got _much_ better toward the end of August. I was really excited to switch in a new blade, but I didn't feel as much of a difference as I expected. And my face didn't weep blood the way it usually does on day one of a new blade.\n\nAnd of course, the brush. It arrived midway through August, so it sat unused next to my AA gear the whole time. Today I finally got to _use_ it instead of just gazing at it admiringly. First impressions: it's _so good._ I mean, I know everyone already knows this. But it's my first Dogwood. Also my first mixed badger and boar brush, and my first 26mm knot. So far, all of these things really agree with me. The only funny thing was that the giant knot doesn't fit so well into the tiny Cella container. Also, I wasn't prepared for that new brush smell. I might pick a stronger soap scent tomorrow to try to cover it up a bit more...",

My lather was even slicker than last week, and as I added water it just kept expanding, almost infinitely.\n\nThe shave was good and the scent is great. It stays close to the face though, and doesn't project. Still trying to determine how to line my beard well with the slant. Tips appreciated.\n\nIn any case, this Reserve base is bomb and use #2 was even better than the first. I'll be picking up Nocturne via pre-order on Tuesday, and may get another Reserve soap, as well.

On my second pass it was much smother and slicker but I still got a very good shave from it. The smell was really nice, sort of exotic woodsy spice. I got the GSBs in another sample pack, I usually use Feathers but I really liked the GSBs and found them to provide a great shave. I really like the B&M reserve aftershave but I'm not sure that the classic scent went well with Maya. It has a nice scent that I'd probably like to pair with a barbershop style scent, it reminds me of something my grandfather would wear in a good way. It's simple but pleasant and unpretentious.",

It also doesn't help that I like to use different soaps and brushes for my head and my face. While it may be unconventional it works for me. I started doing this earlier in the year as I have way too many soaps and this allows me to rotate and use some that may take me awhile to get to if I only used 1 at time.\n\nI used the Declaration Grooming Shore sample on my head. To me the scent is light aquatic just as implied by its name. It had excellent slickness and an even better post shave feel. Gillette Guards work best on the dome for me and I had no issues at all. I would definitely consider picking up a full tub of this in the future.\n\nStirling Baker Street is a fantastic smelling soap and one of my favorites from Stirling. I had no issues at all getting a great lather. The SS and Derby combo made for an easy and mild shave.\n\nI'm not big into frags but got a Baker Street sample of the EdT at the Maggard meet up in June. I'm definitely considering picking it up whenever they are released just to make this fantastic scent last longer.",

I got a creamy, rich lather that was as thick on the third pass as it was on the first. Excellent stuff. I want to try the honey scent next.\n\nThe lather was the highlight of the shave, though. In fact, the actual shave itself, the part with teh razor and teh blade and the cutting of teh hairs and teh whatnot, was not so awesome. See, I never knew what all you assholes (I use that term with utmost endearment) were referring to when you said \"blade feel.\" But I get it now. I started off wetshaving using the V3 from Maggard. My shaves were not great because my technique was shitty. At some point along the way, I got a wild hair and ordered the V3A and I've been using that exclusively for about 4 months now. (On a whim, I went to an antique store and found a '52 Gillette Super Speed but it's collecting dust. I don't know why.) And but so I've been rolling with this V3A and really enjoying it. My technique still needs improvement but it's worlds better than it was when I started shaving.\n\nSo today, I stick this Stirling standard head on my MR7. I did the first stroke and laughed out loud because I cut almost zero hairs *and I could not feel the blade at all,* all I could feel was the bar. The lightbulb went on over my head and I thought *\"this is what they mean by blade feel.\"* I relathered that part and had to noticeably adjust my angle in order to cut any hair. This head is very mild and I found that I had to buff the hell out of a few spots to get it smooth.\n\nMy face isn't super happy right now. I don't even know if I wanna try this head again, seeing as how the V3A is just so much more comfortable and I hardly ever have to buff. But that's what experimentation is for, right?\n\nOn another note, it still makes me sad that Tom Petty is dead. This song has one of my favorite verses from him: *Tired of screwin' up, tired of goin' down, tired of myself, tired of this town. Oh my my, Oh hell yes, honey put on that party dress.* Who hasn't felt like that at times?\n\nI sure have.",

After my initial order of Stirling samples, I saw how much everyone raved about the reserve base, so I figured I would give it a shot and bought all five samples. Man was that a great call. Upon smelling them, I really enjoyed them all, with Classic being the only one that didn't do too much for me.\n\nFor today's shave, Spice really nails the kind of old school fragrance. Whenever I smell it, I can't help but think of fragrances that my dad use to use when i was growing up, and it always takes me back. Today was no different. After dialing in the soap, I had a great shave, with super slick lather and an excellent post shave feel. And speaking of the post shave, this is where I really feel the Reserve base shines: the aftershave. Every time I use a reserve aftershave, I am always amazed at how rejuvenating and good it feels on the skin given that it is alcohol based.\n\nAwesome SOTD today for the second day of Sample September.

The Gillette blade was a revelation, I've never had such a smooth and irritation free shave.

Also yesterday, it was pointed out that my Fatboy could use a clean. So I threw some dish soap and hot water in a cup and gave the Fatboy a soak and a brush off. Then I figured I'd do some of my other razors as well, so the fat handle Tech and AS-D2 also got hot baths. This morning, since the AS-D2 was already out, I threw a blade in and used it for my head shave. It became obvious to me that I could not live with nothing but the Fatboy.\n\nAnyway, about that soap. This one came from the Big Box of Rare Samples and I wasn't sure what to expect when I unscrewed the top. You ever been to Pigeon Forge, TN, or Maggie Valley, NC? Ever been anywhere in the south where year-round Christmas shops are a thing? This soap is what you smell when you walk into one of those year-round Christmas shops. Think cinnamon, thyme, nutmeg... maybe just a hint of vanilla, citrus, and ginger. This soap is southern mountain Christmas. I figured Nocturne was the closest thing I had to pair it with. If I had a puck of this stuff, I might use it exclusively from Thanksgiving through December 26th. Or maybe I would only ever break it out for Dec 24-26 each year and thus I'd never run out.",

I'm looking forward to verifying that more on the next shave.\n\nBlade still rocking, and shave result was above average.\n\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Very Close Shave\n*Neck*: Few hairs are showing some tip length (with most being cut flush)\n\n**Soap Notes** - *Cella*\nTry 1/8 tsp next time. a bit less than 1/4 still gave me 2x as much lather as I needed.\n\nThis time, the first pass was too thick and needed more water. A little irritating, because the lather hadn't really bonded (my own concept) to protect my skin. Later lathers were more hydrated and very smooth.\n\n\n**Brush Notes** - *Declaration Grooming - B5 24mm Badger*\nSeemed to be more dense when my lather was too dry. Didn't splay well. But I think that improved when I fixed my lather. Interesting. Will have to watch for that again to see if it was just my imagination.\n\n----\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger**\n\nUse this to document how long our blades last, if you want, and what about them made us pitch 'em. I created a Google Form with just a few questions:\n\n[Ending of Blades Ledger](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform)\n\n[The Ledger Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing) in case you want to just look at the data.\n\nI'll keep this as my footer each SOTD so you have the link. I'll take it down if no one shows interest.\n",

Dry it's almost all rose, and it stays that way while you load it, but boy does it develop. By the end it's this beautiful woody vetiver, with rose and bitter grapefruit in the background. Great job on this scent, /u/c_bubbles and /u/banes_pubes ! The Luxury Shave Cream base is top notch as usual.\n\nI just got in some Chinese Schicks, I tried them right after I started with injectors and quickly settled on Personnas instead. Decided to give them another try as I have not been enjoying my injectors much lately and maybe it's the blade? The Chick worked well but I still found myself, by the end of the shave, missing my Shovelhead and ER 1914.",

The scent is fantastic, the lather had plenty of great slickness and also delivered a wonderful post shave feel. My wife enjoyed the scent so much she's already asked me to add it to the soap buying list. :)\n\nI really enjoy SoA and it's fantastic passion fruit scent and am bummed I missed out on Passiflora. I've never had any issues lathering or obtaining great slickness out of SoA.\n\nI'm on my second shave with the Derby Extra blade and it's surprisingly holding up well. I was able to get a a smooth and comfortable shave. It's funny how an improved technique can make such a difference. I recall not liking these in a Merkur 34C when I first began wet shaving years ago.\n",

I got this sample not too long ago and have used it a couple of times since and all I have are positive thoughts. The scent is awesome. Having grown up right on the Jersey shore, this shore scent totally nails it for me. It reminds my of all the times spent on the beach in the summer smelling the ocean, laying on the sand, and just catching some sun.\n\nTo go along with the great smell is the superb performance. I really don't have anything bad to say about the lather the Icarus base produces. It does take quite a bit of water, but once you get it going it is some of the best I have used. Tons of cushion, crazy slickness, and the post shave feel is really good. I didn't even use an aftershave today as I didn't feel like I needed to.\n\nAwesome shave today to kick off the first full week of Sample September. I hope everyone has a great start to their week!",

Nice scent a good performance. This b6 brush is legit. The gel tips are extremely soft, and it's very easy to use. I'm really glad I picked it up.\n\nI'm getting absolutely destroyed by fall allergies. It seems way too early for this but my eyes, nose, ears and throat say otherwise. I've sneezed so much today I've lost count. It's time to take measures to get some relief.",

The girlfriend and I woke up earlier and went on a 3-ish mile hike. It's pretty warm and humid here in TN, but it's beautiful out on the trails.\n\nAnother fantastic shave. Dapper Dragon's base works really well for me. Scylla isn't one of my favorite scents, but it's not offensive at all. Pretty lightly scented. Reminds me of salty sea air, which is perfectly fine. I just find myself reaching for more cologne-type scents a little more often.\n\nHope everyone has/had a good labor day!",

I mentioned in the daily questions thread yesterday that my beard trimmer quit recently, and a gentleman in there recommended a nice Wahl trimmer that I will probably check out. However, I had already purchased a Norelco One Blade on a recommendation to try. Long story short, after using the guard on my beard, I used it without guard to try to trim up a stray hair or two by the side burn, and ended up taking a little chunk out of the side of the beard. I figured at this point I may as well go all in with the One Blade and the results on my face were some close areas and some that remained patchy no matter how many times I went over them.\n\nI took my shower, and realized I may as well go completely clean shaven for the first time in 3+ years. I planned to use my Merkur 37c for this shave but given my lack of familiarity with the mapping of my facial hair on the areas that never got blade shaved, went a little more mild with the '58 Super Speed. Lathered up the Mountain Man sample, hit it with a WTG and XTG pass, plus some clean up, and we're in good shape for the moment.\n\nFinished out with a Mountain Man splash sample, Stirling's Unscented balm, and two sprays of Creed Silver Mountain Water before date night tonight with my wife.",

This is my first dip into a mentholated type soap. The smell is nice, I'm not a big fan of summer scents but I did like it. After about 30 seconds of me not getting the cooling effect it hit me, not sure how I feel on it, during the shave it was intense but after I rinsed the soap off it left a good tingle to my face, much how the menthol in American Blend does.",

The scent itself is straight lavender. The Latha base is extremely easy to dial in and I had no issues whatsoever. While I like Lavanda I prefer the Reserve Lavender for its superior base and smoother lavender scent.\n\n70th Anniversary is the only Saponificio Varesino soap that I own. It's a very fresh and complex scent. The soap itself is easy to lather and offers plenty of slickness. I love the presentation of the soap but would prefer it to come in a plastic container to avoid any potential dings to the tin. I have seen the wooden soap bowls for these soaps but would prefer something with a tighter seal to help preserve the soap.",

This is my first shave with anything other than the BBS-1 since July and I gotta say I missed the heck out of it. I'm not sure I even want another DE; once I was able to try a new blade in the BBS-1, I thought it gave the best smooth and efficient shave I've had in some time but even then this Alumigoose was better and faster. I really love how mild and light it is, and the width is a plus too. You could argue it hurts your technique and is idiot proof, but I would argue who really cares. I get good shaves out of it, never any irritation, and it's bordering on impossible to nick myself with. It's only a problem when I try to use a different safety razor and realize I have to be mindful of my angle and pressure. Still withholding my impressions on the soap for now until I feel others have used it enough to get their thoughts on it without being influenced by mine.",

I was initially very impressed with the lather and slickness that it produces. My first two passes were smooth as butter. I did notice that some irritation began to build up during the fourth pass and there was a bit of feedback when I applied the alum. It's possible that I added a bit too much water to my brush (I face lather) on the final passes. I'll need to do more experimentation before drawing a conclusion.\n\nThe scent is very clean, soapy and familiar. If you've ever used liquid hand soap in a large corporate building or medical complex, you probably know what this soap smells like. The scent strength is a bit on the mild side and would be fine for ladies or gents. It might be a bit generic, but it definitely won't offend anyone. If you're looking for a fragrance that pairs well with this soap, Creed's Millesime Imperial is pretty close IMHO.",

RazoRock Mamba... I haven't used it in quite awhile, a smoother shaver for sure but not the most efficient, I can still feel some patchy stubbly areas even after my usual 2 passes. One of the few razors that doesn't irritate my neck though so that is great upside.\n\nAlso I'm super stoked to see the \"Rhymes with Fight Music\" make it for the 9/27 Theme Thursday, oh yeah!!!",

Being just a combo of violet and lavender, it has a simple, but great scent to it. Both notes are nicely blended together so that you get a combination smell of the two rather than one followed by the other. After enjoying using this soap and aftershave sample, I have been thinking about getting the Just right for a Tuesday fragrance. I'm not sure if that is an exact match to the soap and aftershave, but I'm sure it will smell great regardless.\n\nHad a great shave using this soap today. B&M offers, in my opinion, one of the best soap bases out there. Super slick and cushiony shave today with great post shave. Didn't even feel the need to use an aftershave, but with the matching sample, I figured why not.\n\nHope everyone has a great Tuesday.",

The hardware is good, as always. First time out with Cella and not impressed. Post-shave was meh. The AS is usually pretty serviceable, but I think the the Cella sample dragged the whole thing down. Cushion and glide were just OK. With such great stuff out there, I don't see a reason to use just OK products. Happy to burn through the sample, though.",

Fit and finish is amazing for a sub $100 razor, and easily matches the ATT \"basic\" (matte SS) line. I am thinking a lighter razor tends to work better with AC blades in my case, but am still not entirely sure.\n\n* Soap: performance and scent both peerless.\n\n* SE Notes: I always aim for BBS, and discovered I still need three passes even with an AC blade. Two SE passes gives me a better DFS than two DE passes, but still not enough to call the game. I do find the SE shaves leave my face less red, produce no soreness at all, give a longer lasting BBS feel, and the AC blades seem to stay sharper longer.\n\n* My own Semi-Austere August helped me see the charm of one blade and a smaller number of razors, so I think of SEs as kind of like marriage - less variety and a less dramatic range of ups and downs, while DE shaving ( at least how I did it) was more like dating in single life - wider experience range, but not all of it was positive. Like marriage, if you find a blade and SE razor that work well for you, it's tempting to become \"monogamous\" and just accept the same old excellent drama-free shave day in and out...\n\n* But I still have the \"paint scrapers\" (GEMs and Injector) to try as part of SEptember, so let's see how those work out. (So not exactly like marriage, or at least not unless one is a Kardashian or their paramour...)",

It's even harder when you know you're staring down the barrel of a day packed end-to-end with meetings you'd rather not sit through.\n\nHad my first shave with the new (new to me, anyway) Wild West Brushworks/Declaration B3 brush this morning. It did a fine job of whipping up a nice, cool, menthol lather. However, I can't really comment on how scrubby it was (\"scrubbiness\" being the defining characteristic of B3, I've been told) as my dome isn't nearly as sensitive to that as my face is.\n\nIt was nice to get the fat handle Tech back in my hand. I guess I'm making up for my Austere August lack of hardware diversity by revisiting all the items that sat unused for a month.\n\nAnyway, great Dapper Dragon shave this morning. Cool menthol and bright citrus. Why didn't anyone ever tell me how great Scale Polish is? I mean, sure... every SOTD where someone uses Scale Polish, they mention how great it is, but it's not like anyone ever told me directly... \"Hey, you... go buy some Scale Polish because it's really good stuff.\" If you don't have any Scale Polish yet, you need to get some. Seriously. Good stuff.",

Getting to go into work later (5am vs 8am) is incredible for my sleep and my mornings. Normally a night shaver so getting to shave pre work is extremely nice and relaxing. Great way to start the day.\n\nGreat performance from everything as usual. Went with the B plate today and while it's just a touch more aggressive than I prefer, I can't deny I get an excellent close shave from.\n\nB6 also proves to be a great batch. I need a few more shaves for this thing to break in and I can't 100% comment on it vs B4 or B5 yet but no doubt these hairs are going to go fast.\n\nHope everyone has a great Tuesday! 3 day weekends are the best, fuck work!",

I want to become more active in this community as I feel like there is more, higher quality content here vs. the other shave subreddit.\n\nOverall, this was a great shave. I was a little hesitant with the blade as my first shave with the Permasharp left several weepers, but it really smoothed out on the 2nd shave and I had zero irritation. I'll have to see how it keeps developing.\n\nFor the Trismegistus: This was my first use and when I first picked this up off of the bazaar, I wasn't sure how I liked the scent off of the container. It was just kind of blah. Now, after using it, I can say it is an excellent scent and it will see a regular spot in the rotation.\n\nAnd I know...Aqua Velva, but dammit, I love the stuff!

No irritation.\n\nThe whole shave, I was using the new more open handle angle with the Wolfman.

But since I ended up with almost twice as much lather as I needed, I should reduce the soap load time.\n\nTry maybe 15 sec load with 1.5 tsp water.\n\nThe scent is a lemony/citrus that I can get behind. Not straight lemon. There are base notes that come into play that add enough interest for me to keep this one.\n\n\n----\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger**\n\nUse this to document how long our blades last, if you want, and what about them made us pitch 'em.

And I finally got to try out my new Reserve Seville which arrived just in time to mock me through the entirety of AA.\n\nTrue talk: this was a good blind buy. I bought it knowing I could trade or sell both sets of I didn't like the scent. But Seville is an outstanding smellz. Also, I've been looking forward to this razor. It's a fantastic shaver and I got a wonderful BBS shave out of it today.\n\nWhy was it my first shave in four days? I haven't gone this long without shaving since the *week of shame* back in May.\n\nIt wasn't laziness, just absolute maxed out on time. With our back patio and backyard finished, wife noted (very astutely) that we had [nowhere to sit.](https://i.imgur.com/eaa9UTj.jpg)\n\nCorrect as always. I had several hundred board feet of Doug Fir still in the garage, so I set about fixing her up. A simple holiday weekend later, aaaaaaand: [chairs! ](https://i.imgur.com/8Ow6rmx.jpg). They're not Restoration Hardware or Pottery Barn, but [they'll do.](https://i.imgur.com/m8JPNVj.jpg).\n\nWife also found a solid labor day deal on the patio set in the background. So now the patio is proper dressed.\n\nHappy Tuesday ya'll.",

This is a very simple grapefruit scent that felt great on a warm day. I got just the right amount of this soft soap into the bottom of my loading bowl and ended up with plenty of very nice lather for three passes.

I was fully prepared to slog through another underwhelming TOBS sample from my travel kit, but this morning I stumbled upon Nivea Shave Cream at a grocery store in Zurich. To my knowledge it is not sold in the states, so I couldn't resist trying it out. I won't say it's any better than TOBS (another bad shave tonight-stypic pencil working OT), but neither is it any worse. And considering the price (only 3.70 CHF for 100g), I think it's a great value. I dunno, maybe I'm just not a shave cream guy. Maybe I need to bowl lather creams to get the water ratio right. Just haven't been that impressed with the creams I used this trip. Fortunately, the Chiseled Face splash does a great job soothing my skin after a rough shave. 15-20 mins after and signs of irritation are basically gone.\n\n4am wake up call tomorrow, then 14 hrs of flights with a toddler. Probably going to get my ass kicked, but at least I'm clean shaven. 😏",

Sometimes I forget how great Reserve soaps are. My first shave with this was my first with a Reserve soap in a while and I decided to go with it today since I didn't feel I did it justice. Today I went with a much wetter brush and got the amazing results I expect with Reserve but it was better than I remember. Coupled with the scent of Seville, which is one of my top two scents (maybe 1a and 1b with Reserve Cool). In any case, an excellent shave",

I'd definitely consider buying this soap as a whole tub, so far it's top 10 for me.\n\nThe Gillette continues to be a revelation, it's smooth and irritation free, no other blade has come close to this.\n\nI also completely forgot to put on my pre shave oil and I didn't miss it. I'll try another few shaves without it but if the blade continues to be as good as it is I might drop it from rotation.",

Still wish that I hadn't snapped off the tooth. No idea what happened this time as I've been doing it the same way for years. I'm thinking that the tooth that broke may have already had some type of hairline crack in it...who knows?",

The scent is amazing - a wonderful earthy rose. I'm not sure if it's because it got a little warm sitting in the mailbox, but this is definitely a cream and you don't need much at all. I dabbed the cream on to the brush and it looked like there was hardly anything on it, started face lather and as I added water it just exploded with lather. So much so that I realized I overloaded a little. The performance is damn good as well. It makes a slick, protective lather along the lines of of Barrister and Mann Reserve.

I like the scent on this soap, although I think that I'd probably get a little bored if I used it everyday. The slickness, glide, and cushion are absolutely top notch, and it's very easy to get the water/soap ratio dialed in (even when face lathering with a sample). Since the theme of the week is spring/summer, I paired this with Sharp Dressed Man and Green Irish Tweed. A perfect way to start hump day!",

It was my first artisan soap, and now that a short period of time has passed and I've acquired a small collection and gotten comfortable with some other gear, I think it's still my favorite and the best. The soap alone leaves my face feeling better than any lather+post _combo_ I've used. And when you add in the aftershave, I feel like I've gotten a graft of fresh new baby skin.\n\nThe strange thing is that the scent of the soap and AS don't match that well, and I think I've realized why: I've read that they reformulated Morocco to be less smoky at some point, and I think my aftershave comes from _before_ the reformulation, while the soap comes from _after_. The soap is a rich, flowery, foresty scent, and the AS is pure smoke. I grabbed both at Pasteur's, so I can assume they're both relatively old and might come from different batches.",

I tried out the new base by b&m, called pp7. It's fan-fucking-tastic to tell the truth. Just phenominal. I loaded for like 20 seconds just to do a 1 pass shave....nope. I had enough lather for 3 passes, this stuff just kept growing and growing. It's so thick and creamy too, I felt like I was a kid just putting whip cream all over me trying not to eat it :) I mean...look at this shit. https://imgur.com/a/IvHjE77\n\nThe wade & butcher DE is something I don't see very often on here...if at all. Probably the reason for that is that it only takes the survey blades made by W&B. But....I have 3 heads of this W&B, and 1 of them has the poles(I think that's what they're called) filed down to fit a standard DE blade in. The angle was a little hard to find, and I normally use solid bar instead of open comb, but nonetheless it was a great shave.\n\nI didn't use post shave to see how the soap was without anything added after...and my face feels fantastic.\n\nHope you guys had a good as shave as I did!",

I'm only 34, but my favorite band of all time is Rush. Unfortunately, I didn't get into them until they started winding down on touring. Now, they are essentially finished as a band so I will probably never get to see them. As I get older, it's weird to see my idols retire...Peyton Manning, Derek Jeter, Rush, etc. I guess I'm having some existential mid-life crisis or something. Get off my lawn!\n\nEdit: I forgot the razor.",

Even though it is wildcard Wednesday, since I have a bunch of spring/summer scents, I figured I would just stick with the theme of the week. Summer Storm is great. It has a very nice smell that really does remind me of a summer storm. For me, it starts off with a lighter smell like the smell of rain, and then I get the earthy and musky notes to finish it off. Combined, it combines to make a really nice fragrance that totally matches up with its name.\n\nHad a solid shave today. Chiseled Face soaps are very good performers and I had a nice lather from this sample today. Lathered up easy, and had no irritation upon completion. Finished it off with the matching Summer Storm aftershave and was ready for the day.\n\nHave a great Wednesday everybody!",

The scent on Jamestown Gentleman is quite flowery, but still masculine. The slickness, glide, and cushion are consistently excellent. I think that it may be just a bit harder to get the water/soap ratio dialed in, as compared with some of the other top tier soaps, but it doesn't seem to require too much patience either. Since I was shaving with a flowery soap, named after a British settlement, I thought I'd finish the shave off with a fancy British aftershave balm and a flowery Creed scent. Cheers!",

      "body": "**Brush:** Stirling 24mm Finest Badger Fan\n\n**Razor:** Maggard MR7/V3A\n\n**Blade:** Voskhod (4)\n\n**Preshave:** Stirling menthol preshave soap\n\n**Lather:** Chiseled Face - Summer Storm\n\n**Aftershave:** Chiseled Face - Summer Storm\n\n**Song:** [Talking Heads - Seen and Not Seen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rvjw5xJF8WQ)\n\nFrom the 1980 album \"Remain In Light.\" This album also features probably the most well-known Talking Heads song, [Once In A Lifetime](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lw2ilqaLzuA). There are other great tracks on this little album but the track I linked is one that has, for lack of a better word, haunted me since I heard it for the first time, when I was in college. I had decided that I wanted to listen to more full-length albums of artists that I liked. I've always loved Once In A Lifetime and other singles by Talking Heads and I decided that I would listen to the entire album.\n\nThis track is about a guy who is kind of obsessed with celebrities and the way they look and he has this twisted idea that maybe if he thinks about it hard enough, he can actually change the structure of his face to match what he feels is the ideal, well, face. He thinks this desire is common. That everyone thinks about such things. [Here](https://genius.com/Talking-heads-seen-and-not-seen-lyrics) are the \"lyrics.\" I put that word in quotes because this track is more like a poem; there is no chorus and no repeating lines. Think more along the lines of Spoken Word or stream-of-consciousness. (And but even then, what are song lyrics but poetry set to music?)\n\nNow. I certainly do not harbor delusions that I can change my appearance if I want it hard enough. This song, to me, is about a crisis of identity and I certainly experienced that in my brief and turbulent and hilarious attempt at goin' to the big college in the big city and doin' me some book learnin'. It didn't last long. My sophomore year, I had a bad breakup and that's when the alcoholism that I always joked about being in the fledgling stages really spread its wings and took off, with me hanging by the tailfeathers. I did not finish my degree. I no longer considered myself an active and practicing musician. My degree was (supposed to be) in writing and I had dreams and fantasies about writing things that made people feel the way that I felt when I read my favorite authors, which in a nutshell is just 'less lonely.' I went back to working at the restaurant, waiting tables. Occasionally, I had to wait on pretty girls that I went to high school with. They would ask me what I was up to and I would lie.\n\nI had a dream one time, while I was still working there, that my old High School Jazz Band director, who had since passed, came in to the restaurant. I respected this man more than any teacher I ever had. In my dream, it was so busy and I was rushing everywhere and I was stressed and pissed off and nothing was going right and the kitchen kept fucking up my orders and time was moving so slow and he was sitting there watching all of this and trying to get my attention. Finally I stopped in front of him and said \"what?!\" Everything was vivid, down to the melanoma mole on his forehead.\n\n\"This is not what you planned for at all,\" he said.\n\n\"I know,\" I said.\n\n\"You're afraid that you'll never get out of this place,\" he said.\n\n\"I know,\" I said.\n\n\"What will you do?\" he asked.\n\n\"I don't know, sir.\"\n\nThat dream shook me. It's been almost 5 years since I hustled for a tip. Coincidentally, it's been about as long since I've a drink or a high. This song makes me think about that time. Most things in my life are much better than they were but sometimes, usually at night, I still question just what in the fuck I am going to do.",

The lather making between the two soaps is wildly different. Where with the Proraso I had a sopping wet brush and loaded hard for 30 seconds, with this I shook the brush out considerably and had to just lighly brush the tips around the soap, about 10 seconds worth. I had to add some water back during the lather. Some irritation on the neck remained after the shave. I've decided I'm killing this tub after I finish off the Proraso.\n\nGood shaves and the like, boys.",

I'm still a bit upset that I missed the Seville in the Reserve base but I'm honestly just fine with the Glissant base. I can't have any complaints on the performance or anything. Yeah, the reserve base does have more cushion and a slightly better post shave, but this is nothing to scoff at whatsoever. Anyway, happy Friday Eve everybody!",

Seems that this soap likes a wet brush to load with. The after shave is a little disconcerting, as when it comes out it looks a little like baby batter. It goes on greasy but absorbs rather well.

It started out a little rough, and felt ok at the end after I added a little soap. I'm starting to wonder if I'm under loading my brush.\n\nIn the world of weather, it is still hot as hell here. Yesterday, heat index is exceeded 100 which is very unusual for us. They say that a cold front is moving through today which will bring dropping dew points by this evening. I literally can't wait, my blood is too thick for this weather.",

My face felt better this shave than it did my last shave; I'm not sure if that's down to the razor I used, the amount of growth I lopped off, or if the tinkering I did with the test base accounted for the change. Finally, this smell, can't even begin to describe it but I love me some Bleecker Street. It's got sweetness from the amber (reminds me of Fletcher), it's fruity, woody, leathery, just delicious.

So I decided to go with that today. I also decided to try out this Aristocrat I bought off the shave bazaar from u/iamsms. I wanted the razor because it looks fantastic but I didn't really expect the shave to be remarkably different from the Super Speeds (which I really like). I was wrong. I guess the extra weight must be the difference maker here, but this was one of the smoothest shaves I've had in the more than a year since I started shaving. It was almost effortless. I've used this aftershave several times and I love the Stubble Buster aftershaves. You know, I've always been a fan of the feel of tend skin but hated the smell. These aftershaves have the same skin effect with a much better smell at around half the price. So if you have a lot of razor burn or irritation, I would strongly recommend trying some of these aftershaves. The soaps are pretty damn good too for the price or really for any price. It is hard to believe you can get a set for less than $20. I love what Groomatorium is doing with this line.\n\n[coastal](https://imgur.com/gallery/rUqpUgu)\n\nEdit: I always forget theme Thursday so apologies for not fitting in with the theme",

Fun to try the new Dirty Prose from CB.\n\n**Razor and Blade Notes** - *Wolfman - WR1 SB .67 Polished with Gillette - Nacet (37)*\nHad to mow down 2 days of growth, so first pass wasn't smooth. But rest sure were. Blade still doing fine.\n\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Few hairs are showing some tip length (with most being cut flush)\n\n**Soap Notes** - *Catie's Bubbles - Dirty Prose*\nI get a green, resinous, sea grass type note from this one. This may have been the Haitian Vetiver. A side-swipe of something like lime seems to come in as well (looks like it was the grapefruit). And then the Rose is a supporting player in a more subdued way, that I like.\n\nTo my nose, it's like B&M Adagio with some Rose added.\n\n1/4 tsp of soap worked really well with 2.5 tsp of water. Amount was just right for my 3 pass shave. Creamy and luxurious.\n\nPlus, Stirling Sharp Dressed Man balm was a great complement to this soap at the end!\n\n\n----\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger**\n\nUse this to document how long our blades last, if you want, and what about them made us pitch 'em. I created a Google Form with just a few questions:\n\n[Ending of Blades Ledger](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform)\n\n[The Ledger Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing) in case you want to just look at the data.\n\nI'll keep this as my footer each SOTD so you have the link.

Very nimble and quick to maneuver, cuts a minute or two off the total shave time. The edges of the cap are a little less than smooth, so occasional light scrapes during the shave, but nothing terrible, and for a $30 aluminium razor, I am not complaining. I've used this and the General SS for AC blades so far, and I like them both equally - depends on my mood.\n\n* Blade: a Terra Incognita moment - I have never had 7 shaves on any blade before! The Kai Titan is holding up fine, no rust, no dragging, feels like it has another 20 shaves in it. I am experimenting by not removing / cleaning / oiling the blade after each use, and, so far, in my soft water, no probs.\n\n* Soap / Frag: A wonderful scent family, full of complexity and grace. My wife claimed she could smell the soap from the other side of the house this AM, so good to see B&M is not holding back on the scent strength!\n\n* SE Assessment: Another shave on the AC, and then moving over to the Supply Injector to try another type of SE blade. So far, no miracles - my moderately robust non-coarse facial hair needs three passes to get BBS with a SE, much as it does with a DE. Differences are in irritation / post shave feel (better with an SE) and in blade life: as mentioned, I have never had the urge to shave with a DE blade past six occasions, but the Titan seems to be encouraging a much longer duration of effective use.\n\n",

I wanted to figure out if it was the base (which performed well), or the scent (which I really liked), or the batch (?), so I went in on a sample of MLS Cape Verde. And I am still getting a burning sensation, though less so than with The Kraken. I haven't read of people having this kind of reaction from MLS soaps, and when I have seen references to burning it seems to relate to one or more of the scent components, but alas. Here we are.\n\nOther than the mild burning, which was really minor, a fairly decent shave.",

I actually thought I put the blade in wrong because I couldn't get it to cut. So strange how different razors can be. Coming from the Karve this razor on 2 felt less effecient but equally as mild. I do like this razor but after taking a break from it and using only the Karve and coming back to it, I definitely prefer the Karve.\n\nNoble Otter does not disappoint. My face feels so soft. I know everyone raves about the V2 base but the real surprise for me was when I first tried their aftershaves. Definitely some of the most moisturizing alcohol based aftershaves on the market.\n\nAlmost Friday!",

You can definitely tell that Shawn's nose is behind this one. Although I believe it doesn't share any of the same notes as Santal Auster Parfum Extrait, it has a similar vibe. They're both dark and brooding, but Lamplight Penance has a wonderful, smoky, floral opening before settling down to sweet berries, woods, and musk. It really tells a story well and I can imagine Henri Chatillon falling asleep while the lamp burns out. My only problem is that my wife doesn't like it. Ouch. I suppose I'll have to wear it on days she leaves for work before me and really role play as Henri haha",

Growing up, my mother always liked to grow a bunch of Lilacs in her garden, so I have always loved the smell of them. I was surprised to see that there aren't that many soaps that are just pure Lilac, but when I came across this one from Maggards I figured I would get a sample and give it a shot.\n\nIt is a much softer soap than I am use to. It's almost on the side of a cream, so when lathering, i definitely had to make sure I didn't use too much. Once I got it going, it produced a great lather and provided a very nice shave.\n\nThe scent is very nice. Not too much to say as it is just the single note of Lilac. To me, the scent is a little powdery. It doesn't take away from the overall scent, but it isn't as crisp as if you were smelling a Lilac flower. Overall though, it is a solid Lilac scent.\n\nHave a great Thursday everyone!",

There are some very real benefits to sticking with a single setup for an entire 4 weeks. It eliminates all variables and all improvements are technique improvements.\n\nI'm seeing definite carry over even after I've started moving through my other razors. I alway recommend that anyone starting out new with a SR commit to a month of continuous use. It really speeds up the learning curve. But now, I think I'll recommend that occasionally folks pick one razor out of their collection and go back and use just that for 3 or 4 weeks exclusively. There's low hanging fruit to be plucked there.\n\n*In other news, quick \"dumb criminal\" story from work this week:*\n\nOur under cover spotter saw a car parked on a street with two people in it. The car was wanted for eluding (running from the cops) on a previous date. My team moved in to contact the car and folks inside. As soon as we pull up - the driver *immediately* starts ramming our cars trying to get away.\n\nWe had him boxed from the front and back so he was... unsuccessful. After he was taken into custody, we found a loaded handgun in the glove box of his car, with a 32 round extended magazine.\n\nOur enthusiastic would-be-escapee vehemently denied that the gun was his or even knowing it was in the car. Why? Well he's a several time convicted felon, which makes guns a big no-no.\n\nMy partner went to get the driver's phone out of the car before the tow truck loaded it up. When he pulled the phone off the charger, the screen automatically came on and lit up.

It has taken way to long for me to use Scott's ICARUS base. Right off the bat I knocked this soap a little bit, because I dislike the animalistic smell of the base the rest of my impressions are as positive as can be. The soap scent is pleasant, and nice - nothing super strong or offensive, a crowd pleaser. Compared to the bison tallow base, this stuff is so much easier to use. Loads easily, can take water but it's not super thirsty. It builds a wonderful and voluminous lather. But that's only 1/3 of the story. This stuff has META-residual slickness. It's residual slickness has slickness. Post shave I was hesitant to use any aftershave for worry that the post shave feel would be hindered. I only used a drop of the Proraso and luckilybim still feeling the skin food of the soap. It would be a disservice to use any more post shave product. The only thing that compares to this performance in recent use is the Wholly Kaw cream base that isn't even out yet. Scott @declarationgrooming is a maestro of soap.\n\nLather: Declaration Contemplation\n\nBrush: Turtleship Anchor 24mm Synthetic\n\nRazor: Rockwell 6S\n\nBlade: Wilkinson Sword\n\nPost: Proraso Green Lozione",

This wasn't an artisan that I'd heard of, but I feel that the performance and post shave feel on this soap are absolutely outstanding.\n\nThe menthol in this soap is pretty mild. It's noticeable throughout the shave, but less so than any with of Stirling's mentholated soaps that I've tried...definitely not in the neighborhood of CF Cryogen levels. The initial scent is peppermint...it's mild (maybe a 3 out of 10) and not sweet or cloying. There's a really nice layer of frankincense right below the surface that hangs around after the peppermint fades.\n\nIf you're looking for soap with mild levels of menthol that performs well, I'd suggest giving this one a try. I've got ~45 soap samples that I'm going to try to kill over the next few months. This is one of 5 or 6 that I know I'm going to end up buying after that.",

Picked it up from the Bazaar. Lather was good, just like all the other Stirling soaps I have used. I am undecided on the scent.\n\nI have heard people share they get a burnt cigarette scent from time to time. I didnt get that at all. I picked up a strong smokey vanilla scent with coffee/espresso background. Not unpleasant, but much more vanilla than I was expecting. Looking forward to using it again in a day or two and seeing if I pick up more in the scent profile.\n\nHappy Friday!",

It was the first a/s I ever bought way back when I was still using a Mach3. I didn't use a/s every day back then more or less of a special occasion scent, I'd break it out whenever I felt like it. The bottle lasted forever and I found myself into wetshaving so it obviously needed to be killed off. Well, I decided to wear it to work one day, here's where the trouble starts. I'm at my desk having arrived earlier than others and in through the door walks one of my female co-workers probably about 37 years old at that time. She kind of pauses in the doorway and says \"Hmmm, smells like cat piss in here today.\" I had an idea it was me but of course couldn't say anything. Needless to say, that was the last day I wore the Veg to work.\n\nNo, I haven't rebought a bottle of Veg but if any of you guys out there haven't had the pleasure of trying it I'd say pick yourself up a bottle next time you're browsing the mecca of wetshaving, Maggard.",

I happened to find that sample last night and I used it for the first time this morning. I'll be honest, I used to fully despise the smell of patchouli and just think that it screamed dirty hippie every time I caught a whiff. Now, don't get me wrong, I still think hippie when I smell it, but the scent itself is beginning to grow on me these days. I honestly enjoyed the smell throughout my entire shave. It was a refreshing change of pace for me these days. As for the sample of the Clubman I got from my last order from Maggard's...not such a big fan. Probably gonna pass this sample on the next time I trade or sell something. Just not a huge fan of it. So for the shave side of things, Stirling soap is always a winner and the Clubman Special Reserve is a massive letdown. Oh well. Live and learn.\n\nOh and A City on Fire is one of my favorite scents from IA. I got a massive sampler for my wife a while back and she graciously gave me this one and Bull's Blood. I don't know why, but the smell of a burnt match just makes me stupid happy. Anyway, happy Friday gents!",

It's the stuff. Also, I think I really really like these 7 am blades. I usually don't go more than 3 or 4 shaves per blade, but I wanted to stay consistent since I was testing out a new soap base, and it shows no sign of losing it's edge.\n\n​",

Better results than yesterday!\n\n**Razor and Blade Notes** - *Wolfman - WR1 SB .67 Polished with Gillette - Nacet (38)*\nBlade still very strong. Gave me a great cut today! Better than last few days! And still no irritation. Not even when I splashed on the Moos afterwards!\n\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Cut flush to where I just see the tips (above average for me)\n\n**Soap Notes** - *Saponificio Varesino - Dolomiti*\n5 min soak of puck in hot water\nDamp brush into\n15 sec load\n2.5 tsp water added to lather\n\nThis gave me a superbly slick and creamy lather. What a great base. I did end up with a little extra lather, so maybe I'll reduce this just a little bit more.\n\nTry maybe 10 sec load with 1.6 tsp water.\n\nThe scent is a lemony/citrus that I can get behind. Not straight lemon. There are base notes that come into play that add enough interest for me to keep this one.\n\n\n----\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger**\n\nUse this to document how long our blades last, if you want, and what about them made us pitch 'em. I created a Google Form with just a few questions:\n\n[Ending of Blades Ledger](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform)\n\n[The Ledger Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing) in case you want to just look at the data.\n\nI'll keep this as my footer each SOTD so you have the link. I'll take it down if no one shows interest.",

The Kai SE seemed a bit draggy today - still got BBS with a three pass, but the usual more sensitive spots (below nose and jaw) feel a bit raw. The post shave helped a lot and I would not call this a bad shave, but the drop-off on quality from yesterday was apparent. Is 7 the magic number for me and AC blades?\n\n* Soap: Hot off the presses, Nocturne impressed me with its complexity and somber tone. I was expecting a dopey, cheery fake apple scent, like can be found at Bath and Body Works, but this is much deeper and elegant. Which of course I should have expected from B&M...\n\n* Post: AV Sensitive is the best big box balm available. It's a great soother - no sting ever but takes redness and irritation away like magic and smells pretty nice as it does it. Try it if you want to see how good the (relatively) bib boys can get in their post shave formulas.\n\nSEptember Status: Will start using the Supply Injector over the weekend so will have new format evaluation by Monday's shave.\n\n",

When I first received this sample and smelled it, I got a huge smile on my face. It smells exactly like those red candies that your grandmother would always have on whenever you asked for one. Those were some of my favorite candies growing up, so once I smelled this, it immediately took me back. It is definitely a very sweet smell and something I don't think I could shave with everyday, but every so often it's a great one to have a somewhat 'fun' shave with.\n\nAs always, B&M's glissant base is great, providing a slick, cushiony, and protective lather with great post shave feel. I followed the shave up with the matching aftershave sample, which had a quite strong smell, and overall was an excellent shave. Definitely love the smell of Patches.\n\nHave a great end to the work week everyone!",

This razor is far better than any of the other razors in my den; the blade is perfectly aligned every time.\n\nAs a fairly new member to this subreddit (been lurking for a couple of months, but just started posting) I want to thank everyone for the great conversations and discussion.\n\nCurrently trying to decide what other fall scents to get for the upcoming season. I have B&M hallows preordered, but i'm still wanting to get one or two more soaps. I was thinking either Declaration/CL La Foret De Liguest or B&M Nocturne.

The Stirling Boar is just about my scratchiest brush so I don't reach for it as often, unless I have > 1 day stubble. This is my 3rd sample in the (discontinued) Latha line. Previously tried Sandalwood and Taiga and liked the latter so much I picked up a set of it on BST. I find the scent on this one to be true to the name: clean, aquatic, somewhat soapy. Also feel like the Latha line is easier to work with than Reserve (even after watching the Youtube video on how to lather), and the post-shave was excellent. One of the things I like about the slim is the ability to dial down the aggressiveness on my last pass over my neck. Today I forgot to do that, and ended up with a couple of nicks. Decided to finish it off with the dregs of my leaky Summer Storm sample. Overall, the best shave I've had in 2 weeks.",

And like literally everything else in my life that has a deadline, I'm doing it the day of.\n\n**So the TL;DR of this? Seems to me to be a more user friendly Reserve base.**\n\nI'm a big fan of the soap wars that are raging right now.\n\nGlissant, then Bison, then Wholly Kaw Donkey Milk, then Reserve, then Noble Otter 2.0, then Icarus. It's like they're doing front-wheelies off the back slope of their roof, jumping over the swimming pool, and sticking the landing, and then daring the next guy to do better. And then the next guy does the same trick, but blindfolded. Then the guy after does the same trick blindfolded, but also going backwards. And then the next guy up does the trick blindfolded and backwards, but replaces the bike seat with a big, veiny rubber dong, and rides that trick down in reverse cowgirl position.\n\nIt's like, there *has* to be a limit to this, right? How good can shaving soap get? Surely, we're reaching diminishing returns, right?\n\nSo, let's just say I had high expectations for this Barrister and Mann tester base. The reverse cowgirl trick, yeah, that's the one I was hoping for. I mean, Will is no dummy. He knows about Bison and Icarus and WKDM. Hell, he already makes Reserve, which in my opinion, is in the elite of the elite of the elite tier of shaving soaps. You want to call it the best shave soap on the market? Fine, I can't say I disagree.\n\nSo why start dicking around with a new soap base and bother sending testers if you don't feel like you struck on something more dope? Perhaps my expectations were unreasonable.\n\nI used this tester 3 times. Once with a Declaration B6 Jefferson and twice with a Plisson synthetic. I'm a Marco Method loader exclusively (read: wet and heavy. Like...like...like your mama). I kinda fling some water out of my brush before loading, but not much, and I'll even put a bit of water on top of the puck to get the ol' gal nice and lubed up.\n\n\"Uhhh uhhh omg omg uhhh uhhh omg IT'S JUST SO MESSY!!!!111!\"\n\nLook, son. You're ostensibly standing right there at a goddamn sink, right? You're not lathering up while you're standing above your accountant's desk or within more than several meters away from priceless, historic waterpainted works of art, are you? Are you mounting your brush onto the head of a Stanley power drill? Are you E. Honda and loading your soap at the speed of [the hundred hand slap?](https://youtu.be/Az8r1Xmwjmo)\n\nIt's not that big a deal. It's wet. Load it over your sink and spin your brush in the puck at a reasonable pace, not like you're some 9th grader with a wifi connection, a tube sock, and an empty house. Pace yourself. The excess drips down the sink. You'll be rewarded with optimal lather made from a superior loading methodology. You having trouble with Icarus? With Reserve? Too thick, pasty, and stringy? Get it wet, my guy.\n\nSo anyway, that's what I do, and that's what I did. Right off the bat, it's clear this completely lacks the stringy goo that Reserve has in spades. It is also a much firmer puck than the Reserve. I love me some Reserve, but it took me a few uses to figure out and dial in. It's easy to overload. Even loading wet, it's easy to underwater. Not so with the PP7. it's extremely intuitive to load. It whips up easy into that greasy-looking, wet paint, shiny, whipped egg white sheen.\n\nI don't love synthetic brushes any longer, but Will is on that synthetic brush nonsense, so that's how I tested it. Perhaps, just perhaps, he's onto something. I got better lathers with the synthetic. Now back into the dopp bag with you, Monseuier Plisson. See ya when I see ya, but probably at a Hilton Garden Inn next trip.\n\nIt's about as slick as anything I've used this side of the stuff we keep in the top drawer of the bedside table. Slick for days. Elite slick.\n\nThere's two things I definitely don't do in wetshaving -- chase BBS or use the term YMMV (for reasons of extremely sensitive neck-meat and because it's lazy, trite, and pants-on-head retarded, respectively). Usually I'm 2 passes, with and across the grain, and I call it Gucci. For science -- and because I'm committed to this tester lyfe -- I tried 3 passes the first use. It went *okay.* I went 2 passes each other time. Conclusion: it's slick AF, but it's not magic. If you do only two passes normally, then you do two, playboy.\n\nAs far as post-shave feel? Who the fuck cares? Post-shave feel is the YMMV of shave metrics: people include it and say it a lot, but why though? Because they think they're supposed to? Because they lack in creativity and take cues from the zeitgeist-less leisureguy? Probably. Aren't you using aftershave? Are you walking around for an hour in your undies after you shave, but before you splash on your post? So I treated the post-shave metric as I would any other useless, nonsense shave metric (lather taste, lather punctuality, lather congeniality, lather effect on blood humours and phrenology, lather butthole lube-ability) and completely disregarded it and didn't test it. I use aftershave for my post-shave feel. If you're interested, it's probably good. Or not. Who cares?\n\nAll in all, I came away highly impressed. Without any more tinkering, it's elite level. It's Reserve without the strings, and Icarus-firm without the goat. I don't know how wide a range of water it'll take because I don't fucks wit sub-optimal, lame-o, buster-ass dry brush loading and dripping in water like some octogenarian with prostate troubles at the urinal. It stands up to Marco Method as any great soap should: bad-aasingly.\n\nIt's slick as snot, easy to load, nice thick and shiny lather, intuitive, and the puck has a nice firmness. Checks all the boxes for me. And I can't think of anything it's wanting.\n\nSurely, I mean SURELY, we're getting close to peak lather and coming up on diminishing returns? Right? Right? But if not, ho boy.\n\nThanks for letting me try this /u/bostonphototourist\n\nI'm excited to see what you are going to do with this. You don't have to change a thing, but I'm sure you probably will. But you don't have to.",

I started with a straight but was having noticeable difficulty keeping the edge sharp. My guess is, I wasn't using the proper stropping technique. So after ~20 shaves, I bought this Feather AC razor. This was back in mid-2016. I was never really into Straights due to the nostalgia effect, I just wanted to learn the skill of shaving with a razor without any safety bar. So getting the Feather made sense.\n\nIt took me ~5 shaves to figure out the Feather - I started getting wonderful shaves. I continued with it for a long time (~70 shaves) before going back to a proper Straight again. I eventually figured out traditional straight razors, stropping and all that. For some reason, I slowly stopped using the Feather. Even though I always got great shaves with it.\n\nI have not used this razor in 2018, and I kept a detailed log of my shaves in 2017 so my last shave with it was on November 18 last year. One might think I do not enjoy this razor or I do not get great shaves with it. But that couldn't be further from the truth.\n\nI had a 3+ days growth going ( I was on vacation). But was too lazy to strop a SR, so decided to use the feather. I immediately remembered why I used to love this razor. It is so easy to use, the balance is perfect. The blade is sharp without being harsh. Shaving angle is a bit different than regular SR - not nearly as flat.\n\nLet me be clear - if someone wants to get a complete feel of a straight razor from a Feather AC, he/she will be disappointed. But that isn't necessarily a bad thing - I do not look to find the taste of a steak in a sushi place - both are fantastic but vastly different.\n\nIn terms of sound (which is something I enjoy in a full hollow razor), the feather is more like a near-wedge/quarter-hollow. It is way more silent than noisy. It is definitely less forgiving than a regular straight - it will bite if you press accidentally. But I would say much more forgiving than an aggressive DE or a shavette with a DE blade. Where it shines is the sharpness and smoothness (with proper technique) AND the size. I have always thought the length of a regular SR is not really perfectly suitable for shaving neck - especially for someone whose hair grows sideways and not enough fat on the neck (yet) to make it flat. I have two hole-like areas on each side of my Adam's apple and my beard grows sideways and lays flat on neck. So shaving those two areas is always a challenge - I can never quite get BBS with a SR. But with Feather, it is much much easier for me due to shortened length. It still takes some improvised strokes - but I can get it done.\n\nFinally, I can rinse the blade without worrying about rust, ignore the after-shave razor prep, store it anywhere I want.\n\nI did a 3 pass shave today, but I could easily stop after the first pass - Feather AC, for me, is the best 1 pass shaver. The efficiency of this razor compared to my best DE/SE razor during WTG pass is way superior. So the next two passes are more like clean up passes.\n\nI am very happy that I used the razor today, and I would encourage others to try Feather AC if you are bored with your razor choices - it will take some time and concentration, but results are fantastic. Just do not look to replicate your SR experience here.\n\nFinally, shout out to a gentle-hombre u/Reguyw_nothingtolose for sending me this sample of WCS Fougere. It is a very nice/clean inoffensive Fougere that isn't too green. Really enjoyed the lather and the scent.",

It's such a nice sweet scent. Really does make me wanna pick up some Spicebomb. AA robbed me of using all my favorite bases, and going from Icarus to PP7 and to now this, I just love all these bases so much that I think I've come to two conclusions: 1. At a certain point, I almost don't care how good a soap is, especially in the post shave; that super supple, fatty face feel afterwards is good, but a good aftershave can get dang near that anyway. If the scent is awesome, I'm gonna get it and I'm not going to be sacrificing quality when I use it. 2. It makes me not want to use any that are noticeably (to me) of lesser quality. I've long thought my top two tiers were a lot closer than tiers 2 and 3 were, and while I'm now certain of this, I also think there's just elite soaps and then all the rest.\n\nAnyway, if you haven't picked up any of the new Noble Otter, I can't praise the soap enough. Cody's got a real talent for scents too, with Barrbarr and that Tea one (stupid The with an accent mark followed by Noir et Vanille...or something) being far and away my favorite scents. I dragged my feet on picking his stuff up thinking \"ok, here comes yet another soaper, probably just using preblends, blah\" but that was a mistake. Don't repeat my mistake, this stuff is the real deal and its got the packaging to match.",

Icarus made me want to use Icarus today. Both are superlative soaps. I'm still not totally sure which I prefer, although the fatty, dense lather of bison is truly amazing. We're just spoiled I guess. Interestingly, Icarus seems to be one of the few soaps I've used that I'd say it's easier to generate the proper lather using a badger brush than a synthetic brush. Hmmmm......\n\nThe Puma was nice today. The 5/8 size was a bit more maneuverable than the Wade and Butcher I've been using prior to today.\n\nB6 continues to impress. It's getting better and better with each use.\n\nHappy Saturday to all!",

This is in the B&M reserve base, and is always a great soap to use.\n\nOut of the 5 reserve scents, I think this one is the best. It just had a very nice smell while perfectly capturing the scent of lavender. I have smelled a few other strictly lavender scents, but this one is my favorite for sure. It almost smells like the whole lavender plant, including stem and leaves, and that is what puts it at the top for me.\n\nHad a great shave to start off the weekend. Very thirsty soap, but once going, it produces a very slick lather. Could not recommend the reserve base enough. Followed it up with a matching sample of the aftershave and got my face feeling great. The reserve aftershave is in a league of its own I think, and the fragrance matches very well.\n\nEnjoy your weekend people!",

Been using Gillette Platinums as my go to and the difference I noticed with the Polsilver is that it required more pressure. GPs just do the work for me and if I apply pressure it can irritate my skin. The Polsilvers however, are opposite. They tug unless I apply pressure but don't irritate if I press down a bit. I was even able to get a BBS with a 4th ATG pass. Hmmmm... Is it possible that blades that need more pressure get better shaves? I might need to revisit some other blades that I disregarded in the past. A quick words about the scents: awesome combo!",

Thank you, Sir! I tried searching for more info on this soap maker, and it seems this French artisan is no longer producing soaps or he releases on his own timetable. This is in stick form and is made with donkey milk. It has a peppermint scent to it, but for me I didn't pick that up at all. Smelled like a clean soapy scent. After rubbing it into my beard, I took my trusty Omega boar and easily worked up a nice dense lather. Excellent protection and zero issues. I would say it compares favorably to something like Haslinger Schafmilch with tallow and lanolin.\nGreat Saturday shaves to all.",

In terms of performance, both the soap and splash from CF consistently give me good results. I particularly love how smooth the AS makes my skin feel once it soaks in. The Trade Winds scent is pleasant, but I find it to be pretty mild coming off the soap. Not sure I would pick this up as a set, but I may get a full bottle of the splash at some point down the road, just because I love how it performs and I think it would pair fine with a number of other soaps in my collection.",

I put a smear of the soap in the bowl while I showered with some water to try and correct the dryness I had on the first pass last shave. The problem with this method was that a lot of the soap dissolved into the water and I had to apply more soap to the bowl before lathering. Once I did I took my time and and was rewarded with a nice thick, creamy, smooth lather. The scent of Tradewinds almost reminds me of Irish Spring but not as overpowering. It's a light clean scent that I really enjoyed, the scent is very present but not overwhelming, I'd be fine wearing this to work after shaving without worrying about the smell bothering any of my patients.\n\nEasy Street is one of the first artisan aftershaves I bought years ago from Pasteur's in Manhattan and it's my go-to when I want something that seems to compliment any type of clean/fresh smelling soap. It's lightly mentholated and leaves me feeling fresh and cool.",

It was nice to see it show up in the Big Box of Rare Samples so I'd actually have a chance to put my nose on it. In fact, it was one of the larger samples (and full), so it went into the \"shave with it\" pile. Off the puck, I don't get a lot of the yuzu. I get mostly rose backed by the dark, musky, earthy patchouli. Now that I've tried it, the itch is scratched and I don't think this is one of those scents I'm going to be pursuing as a permanent addition to my den. It's nice, but I don't love it.\n\nAs usual, Wholly Kaw's donkey milk base does not disappoint. The only problem came when I accidentally spilled some water into the lather bowl after my first pass and wound up doing the second pass with very runny lather. Even drowned to the point of becoming YRP soup, it still provided excellent slickness.\n\nI don't know how long it's been since I used the Parker razor. Probably well over a year. It's heavier than I remembered. I had it in my head that it was not a good razor because I used to get all sorts of razor burn when I used it. Now I feel like I can say that is more aggressive than my AS-D2 or post-war Tech, but the problems I had before were 99% technique (or lack thereof). I did my standard 2 passes on the dome today and came away BBS with no blood drawn and no irritation that the balm didn't take care of. It's still not my favorite razor, but (pending a face shave tomorrow to confirm) I no longer view it as a bloodthirsty demon in search of a sacrifice.",

Cologne scents aren't my favorite flavor of soap frags, but this one is nice.\n\nKind of reminds me of high school prom. The smell of too much cologne, heightened expectation, and the unmistakable musk of a rented suit. All that's missing is the smell of bud light and the faint waft of hormones slowly filling the gymnasium.\n\nAwkward guys sway with barefoot girls holding their 6\" heels in one hand, the other hand tugging to keep their discount gown up in place. Aerosmith's *[I don't wanna miss a thing](https://youtu.be/JkK8g6FMEXE?t=1m03s)* plays in the background.\n\n\n*sigh* memories. Right guise? ^guise?",

Unlike some of my other razors that leave more room for error I discovered last night that this thing does not work well with Ladas blades. The brush is new and this is the second time I have used it. Got it off Etsy from Derek at Wild West Brushworks and I opted for the Cashmere knot. Not too much backbone on the knot but it does splay fairly easy and allows for a good face lather. The handle is much wider than anything else I own but the design fits well in the hand. Love the sheriff star coin, too. All in all it was a good shave.\n",

I was lucky enough to receive my Autumn Ash order in the mail today, and with the weather coinciding with yet more soap, I thought I would try it out.\n\nThis is a truly wonderful scent. Both off the puck and in lathering it comes across very sweet. The maple is very forward here, but it is tempered by the wood and smoke elements of the scent, which deepen it and add darkness to the soap. As someone who has lived in New England for most of his life, this really captures that feeling of early to mid October, before the leaves are gone but once fall is truly set in.",

The Voskhod blade worked much better for me than the Lab Blue, and I'm satisfied with the result.\n\nFirst go with TASS. This is their tallow formula, which from what I understand is exclusive to WCS. I have not experienced their vegan base but the tallow is exceptionally good. The scent is Spanish Cedar, and Sweet Tobacco. It's really strong out of the tub, what surprised me the most was even after I rinsed off my face I could still smell the scent on me.\n\nThe aftershave is really good too. Small bottle, but a little bit went a long way. Three drops on my palm and my face felt really good after. I can still smell the scent on my almost 4 hours later!",

Revisiting an old friend, my fav silvertip from WD.\n\n**Razor and Blade Notes** - *Wolfman - WR1 SB .67 Polished with Gillette - Nacet (39)*\nBlade still delivering with quality, close shaves. No irritation! I'm about to hit 40!\n\nI'm getting better at the Wolfman, and keeping the more open handle angle to keep with close shaves.\n\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Few hairs are showing some tip length (with most being cut flush)\n\n**Soap Notes** - *Mystic Water Soaps - Marrakesh*\nNext time: 1/4 tsp (or a bit less) of soap with maybe 3 tsp (or tad more) of water. Was great this time, with just a bit more lather than needed. Very little to change with this mix.\n\nSo slick and creamy.\n\nScent: I think this might be in the Bay Rum family of soaps. From the puck I thought it was interesting, but during the shave I wasn't feeling it as much. I liked that it had strength though. Then I smelled my Cella post shave balm and then went back to the Marrakesh puck and got a whole new family of notes from it, more woody than spicy now. I wonder if this is one of those soaps I need to use a few times before I \"get\" the scent.\n\nAnd the Cella balm worked really well with the Marrakesh soap.\n\n\n**Brush Notes** - *Whipped Dog - Silvertip 22mm Tall Handle*\nBack to a new incarnation of an old favorite, my WD Silvertip. My first Silvertip was this knot. But the handle was too short. So now I have a longer handle with a great knot. It is so light and comfortable. I might prefer that it has a little more backbone, but not nearly as much as so many brushes out there have. If I have to choose one extreme, I choose cushy, cloudy comfort.\n\n----\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger**\n\nUse this to document how long our blades last, if you want, and what about them made us pitch 'em. I created a Google Form with just a few questions:\n\n[Ending of Blades Ledger](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform)\n\n[The Ledger Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing) in case you want to just look at the data.\n\nI'll keep this as my footer each SOTD so you have the link. I'll take it down if no one shows interest.\n",

I feel like I've neglected Executive Man. This was my second soap (the first being London Barbershop from the Maggard Starter Kit). I used it quite a lot for a while, but then just acquired a lot of other stuff. But this stuff really is great. I haven't used Stirling Soaps in a little while but it was like riding a bike. Just a few drops of water and a little work and that thick, slick lather was popping all over the place. The Aristocrat was a perfect companion today and fits the theme nicely. I had a very nice two pass shave and closed it out with the EM balm. I love the Stirling balms and don't use them nearly enough. I need to remember to get an unscented so I can use it everyday.",

I get a bit of a bug spray vibe from it. It seemed like that died down a couple hours after I sprayed the EdP, though, and the scent became really beautiful.\n\nBut I'm pretty sure it's my nose that's wrong here, and not the scent. I get the same thing from a couple of Chatillon Lux scents, too. There must be something here that I just don't sense the same way most people do.\n\nShaved this morning, but I'm posting late because I spent all day packing. More of the same tomorrow-it always takes longer that you expect. I decided to pack away all my soap tubs, so it's just samples for a week or so until I unpack on the other side.",

Understated, confident, manly.\n\nAnd my blade is now middle-aged.\n\n**Razor and Blade Notes** - *Wolfman - WR1 SB .67 Polished with Gillette - Nacet (40)*\nCelebrating 40 uses on this Nacet! No irritation, with an above average cut for me today! Woot. I haven't felt any degradation for about 25 uses now. Really odd.\n\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Cut flush to where I just see the tips (above average for me)\n\n**Soap Notes** - *Stirling - Responders 4 Life (Gray Vetiver)*\nPretty much a perfect ratio today: 1/4 tsp soap to 2.75 tsp water. Slick as usual, and rich with creamy goodness.\n\nScent: classy and understated. Strong in character, but mild in presence. Interesting and yet classic and professional. Doesn't put on airs. I can see how this was chosen to represent first responders as they do their jobs with the same admirable character traits.\n\nThere seems to be a woody note in there that probably is what grounds this thing for me and makes me a huge fan.\n\nScent strength was 3/10, but I enjoyed the quality of the scent so much, there's no way I'm letting this guy go.\n\n\n----\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger**\n\nUse this to document how long our blades last, if you want, and what about them made us pitch 'em. I created a Google Form with just a few questions:\n\n[Ending of Blades Ledger](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform)\n\n[The Ledger Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing) in case you want to just look at the data.\n\nI'll keep this as my footer each SOTD so you have the link. I'll take it down if no one shows interest.",

First go with this brush, and it seems a bit scubbier than my other B3's, almost to the point of scritchy. Have to see if it softens up after a couple of uses.\n\nI would have gone with a Dr. Jon's scent due to the AMA yesterday. But Ruby's Green has been calling. RG has always been one of those splashes that every time I use it i wish there was a bite of menthol in it. Well I got some menthol crystals at the end of August and added 1 large sized one.

And the donkey milk base has been firmly established as a top performer, especially for my extremely dry skin.\n\nAnother go with the shavvette and I'm getting more comfortable with each use. Some people think that using a shavette is the same as using a SR. Not to me at least. Two animals that look similar, but have very different personalities. Each has its weaknesses and strengths. I am just happy to finally be getting some good shaves with a shavette. This is definitely going to be my travel razor.\n\nIt's too wet to cut grass, so i'm Stuck cleaning shitters. :/",

Thanks to /u/Hyvasuomi79 for letting me snag this and some others from his PIF. Knowing this was a polarizing scent, I had to try it and see if it was a keeper.\n\nOut of the tub, the smell of smoke is very heavy - too heavy for the wife. The tobacco and damp earth notes surround the smoke, and as the soap is lathered, it almost smelled like walking through a hazy cloud to a table of familiar friends drinking bourbon and smoking cigars. No irritation from the soap, which loaded and lathered easily like other Glissant-base soaps. Shave-wise, was definitely able to get some clean-up passes done with residual slickness alone. This shave was finished in about 25 min and was BBS-1, so pretty great for overall experience and efficiency.\n\nPost-shave felt pretty great. The aftershave felt similarly strong when first splashed on the face, a little overpowering; however, after the harshness of the top notes burned off (5-10 min or so), the scent melded with my own and evolved into more of a sweet-and-smoky, vanilla tobacco & maple-like musk... and the family loved how I smelled. From 2-4 hours into wearing the AS, it was a sweet and seductive autumnal fragrance, close to the body, in the same family as Southern Witchcrafts' Autumn Ash.\n\nVerdict: B&M Roam is definitely a keeper, and will likely get a lot of use this season as the Ohio Valley is transitioning into Fall.",

I pulled out a very worthy soap to do the razor justice, the original badass soap of the wet shaving world, the legend, white label Roam. It's one of 4 soaps I have 3 backups of - the others being Ballenclaugh Hot Barrel Rose, Latha LPC, and RR Blue Barbershop. If /u/chiseledface ever decides to reformulate or (gasp) discontinue Sherlock and Midnight Stag, I'm buying them all.\n\nShaving with a wide extra hollow is LOUD and extremely satisfying. ~~Or~~ It almost feels like this razor bends to follow the contours ~~I'd~~ of your face, just like a Gillette Flexball ;-) A big wedge is just as satisfying, but in a completely different way.\n\nNo post shave, and for all the dry skin people, stop reading now. After shaving, I rinsed off, applied whatever lather was still in the brush while I cleaned up, then just wiped off the soap, no rinsing. I can still smell the Roam two hours later. It's a good day.\n\nEdit: stupid auto-correct",

Reserve is among the weirdest bases but dangit if it isn't the absolute slickest in existence. I can understand why some could struggle with it as it'll do you wrong if you're not paying attention. But if you do, and stop before it gets too stringy and messy, you'll have a good time. Not sure I love this scent but it's good enough. The performance is at the top of the top, especially the aftershave. Such a pleasure to use the Reserve line, just wish there were more scents that I loved. Still raining with no signs of stopping and it chilled out a bit so I decided to smell LP for the first time since the Maggard Meet. Can't wait for the world to experience this stuff.\nNFL and fantasy football nerdery is back today and I couldn't be more excited. Have a great Sunday.",

TryThatSoap predicted I'd rank Lu'au around 2.9 on their 5 point scale and I'd say that was a pretty good prediction. If there happened to be a tub in a bazaar lot I picked up, I'd probably hang on to it, but I wouldn't specifically go hunting for a tub for its own sake. And that right there is the joy of samples. They let you figure these things out with minimal commitment.\n\nAs for the Parker razor, well, it's aggressive. According to Amazon, I ordered this thing in June of 2015 - about 6 months after I started my DE journey with an Edwin Jagger DE89. I think I've probably done less than 10 shaves on this razor because it just isn't quite right for me. Oh well, back into the drawer it goes until I either decide to let it go or decide to give it another try.\n\nAs for the B3 brush and scale polish, you can have them when you pry them from my cold dead hands.",

I figured this was a good one to round out the week so that I could contemplate all of the samples I used this week. It offers a nice scent that reminds me of a scent you would get on a hot summer day in the middle of a field.\n\nThis is one of the soaps just released in the Icarus soap base and is a great performer. It's exceeds in every category, and while thirsty, it really rewards you once you have it going. Good way to end out the week.\n\nHope everyone's Sunday has been relaxing. I'm stoked that football is back.",

I almost always pick this soap and base when I am not sure what I would like to use. My only complaint about this soap is that I wish the lather was thicker. It seems to be a thinner lather for me, while it still performs great, I like the feeling of a thick and dense lather. I have no problem with classifying it as a great soap other than that but I just wish it would generate that lather similar to Bison.",

      "body": "SOTD Monday 9/10\n\nSEptember continues, but after an awful injector shave on Saturday, I started a new Polisilver DE in my ATT Windsor for alternating daily comparison / succor.\n\n* Razor: Supply Injector Plate 2 (mid aggression)\n* Blade: Personna Injector (2)\n* Soap: Reserve Fern\n* Brush: Stirling 24mm fan\n* Post: Duke Cannon Cooling Shave Balm\n* Frag: Guerlain Vetiver EDT\n\nProduct Notes:\n\n* Razor / Blade: Shave 2 with the Supply Injector was much better than Shave 1. Still prone to \"mystery weepers\" (why am I bleeding there?) but only one small brief one today versus three larger ones during shave one including one persistent flow that lasted through the post shave application.\n\n* The Supply handle is gorgeous and well made, but has that wee tiny screw on it that is used to adjust and remove the plates / blades. Wee screw seeks to fall down your sink drain, and so is not the ideal design feature for a razor, and also pokes one in the nose as you shave your upper lip. (Note: YNMV...)\n\n* The Supply does kind of easily show you the proper shave angle, and feels very smooth as it shaves. The mystery weepers are therefore all the more puzzling, as was the bad razor burn I got after shave one. Shave two was fine, but that was with Reserve and the great menthol balm, which may have helped. Or the blade may just have mellowed...\n\n* The Injector strikes me as an ideal cartridge replacement. It does not have the drama or interest of a DE shave or an AC blade shave, and the really limited blade selection (Personna and Schick) also feels like a cart. Also like a cart, the Supply is best at WTG passes and needs a bit of care to go ATG. If you want a quick two pass DFS with mainly WTG passes, Supply is your tool, but if you want BBS and a lot of buffing and cross grain passes, you will probably find this system less than optimal, Also, the BBS I got in Shave One (at the cost of some blood and pain) only lasted five hours, so much like a cart in that as well.\n\n* The ultimate problem with Supply I think is the Personna blades it comes with. The blade does not feel as sharp as even say an Astra SP, and it lacks the thickness of an AC (along with the increased width of that blade which many say is a mixed blessing.) The Schick blades (or \"Chicks\" as they are called due to their national origin) are rumored to be better but I have not tried them yet.\n\n* The unbranded Personna injector pack supplied by Supply comes with 20 blades for $0.75 each and Supply claims each blade will last for 9 shaves. That figure seems optimistic to me, but I will give it a try. The plastic blade guide in the Personna pack is also either poorly made and / or does not work very well with the Supply, as it was starting to feed the blade directly across the front stops, and needed me to pause and loosen the Lose Me Screw in order to avoid banging the hell out of the blade.\n\n* Still, the Supply Injector is rather novel and fun to use. I remember my Dad shaving with these things, so there is some nostalgia in the use, and handle itself is both attractive and highly functional. The mystery weepers are a tad annoying, but the dealbreaker is the 5 hour BBS, which is more or less half to two thirds of what I can normally get with a good DE or AC shave. I'll use the Personna a bit longer, and may swap out to a Schick to see if they are better. So for now a qualified recommendation for those who are either using a cartridge now or for those who want a quick, brief DFS quality shave.\n\n* Balm: Saw this at Target over the weekend and picked it up. Appears to be a close clone of the Cremo cooling balm, with most of the same elements of that balm in a slightly different proportional balance.\n\n* Like Cremo though, this balm is amazingly effective - quick cooling, de-reddening, good long lasting moisture. Has a somewhat more prominent scent then Cremo (woodsy) but not much more so as menthol tends to drown out scent very effectively.\n\n* At $10 for six ounces, this is a decent bargain, especially if one likes that menthol kick.\n\n",

I reached the bottom of the tub around 4 or 5 shaves ago and I think this soap only has around 5 shaves left. B&M 42 was the first scent I got after getting into wet shaving a couple of months ago. Still to this day this scent is simply amazing to me; i've never smelt anything that's even close to what this soap smells like. Cheers!",

This time I went with a sample of The Noir et Vanille (pretend like there is a fancy ` in there). This is my first time with the new base and damn, is it good. I like the old stuff, but this is exceptional. I have no earthly idea what this smells like. I know it is supposed to smell like black tea and vanilla and some other stuff, but I mostly get the other stuff. It has a very floral scent to my nose and I rather enjoy it (I guess that is the jasmine I'm smelling). It is very different and I had nothing remotely similar to pair it with in terms of aftershave, so I just went with Stubble Buster Stygian, which is a Polo Black clone I think.\n\nI'm really enjoying this Aristocrat. It is my fourth or fifth time using it and I enjoy the weight and how smooth a shave it gives me. All around great shave today!",

As a barbershop scent, I think it is pretty unique. It has some similar notes to other barbershops, but also a somewhat sweet smell to it that I really do enjoy.\n\nAs for performance, it performs very well and produced a very nice lather. I haven't used any of Noble Otters previous line before, so I can't compare, but this one does very well. Upon finishing I didn't feel the need for any aftershave as my skin felt nice, and I would definitely recommend this to people looking for a nice, sweet scent.\n\nHave a great start to the work week everyone!",

It sheds regularly (at least 3 this shave) and doesn't excel at the \"painting\" strokes I like to use. WK soap whipped up a quick lather, and I like the scent (more sophisticated take on Barbershop), but I'm not convinced this one is worth the hefty price premium with so many other excellent artisan soaps on the market. Delor de Treget is my first CL purchase and I like it a lot--very strong orange citrus scent on application, but it settles down fairly quickly. It has a cooling effect but it not as bracing as some other alcohol-based splashes, and every bit as moisturizing as any balm I've used. Given the performance, I don't mind the price premium for CL but do wish I could try samples of their various scents before committing to a full bottle...",

The new one is better, but this one is no joke. Very enjoyable shave and I really liked the classic scent of the soap. Such a good blend that it was a little difficult to identify many of the components.\n\nHowever, the new AS that I have of this same scent is really just a tobacco scent. Quite different than the old-version soap.\n\n1/4 tsp of soap was just right. I ended up adding 3.5 tsp of water.\n\n\n----\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger**\n\nUse this to document how long our blades last, if you want, and what about them made us pitch 'em. I created a Google Form with just a few questions:\n\n[Ending of Blades Ledger](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform)\n\n[The Ledger Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing) in case you want to just look at the data.\n\nI'll keep this as my footer each SOTD so you have the link.

Quite nice feeling, does wonders for my skin since i stopped using proraso green splash. The cream lathers well but still i bit disappointed at the weak and fleeing scent of rose.\n\nFirst try of voskhod! Nice and clean shave. A dfs (damn fine shave) is what i got today. Seldom i get it on the first use, usually it is only on the second use. :)",

I use it just to line up my goatee and I cannot seem to get consistent results with this. It has to be a technique thing because some mornings, I have zero problems and other mornings, like this one, I'm bleeding in multiple spots and have to dispatch a styptic pen to stem the gore. It's frustrating. I'm nervous enough as it is using it to line up my goatee. The thought of doing an entire, multipass shave with this thing is pants-shittingly frightening.\n\nSpeaking of things that frighten me, I start therapy today. My only experience with this is watching *The Sopranos,* which is an excellent show if you haven't watched it. While they were setting me up with someone, they asked what it was for and I think I said general anxiety with some work stress on the side. I guess I don't even really know what anxiety is, technically. Is it that different from being just generally worried? About everything? All the time? Because that's what I do. I'm good at it.\n\nI suppose that I feel in danger. Not in a physical sense but in an emotional sense. I believe that I nurture an intensely negative image of myself and my circumstances and in doing that, I feel in danger of developing such a negative attitude toward myself and the world in general that at some point, it becomes irreversible. I just turned 30. I wish for this upcoming 10 year chunk to be better than the last 10 year chunk and have arrived, begrudgingly, at the conclusion that I just cannot get better by myself. This way of thinking that I've trained myself to do has become unsustainable and it cannot continue. As a man living in 2018 America, it feels taboo to say it but norms and mores be damned, here. I need help.",

This was my first shave with this brush and overall I'm pretty pleased. It's my first fan knot and I'm kind of in love with how easy it is to face lather with it, though I wish the loft was a tiny it smaller for easier splay. The fibers feel good against my face as I like a bit of scrub, and the handle is gorgeous so I'm not sure why this was considered imperfect. Scent-wise the bitter orange of Santa Paula went exceptionally well with the spicy Dirty Prose. I'm very happy with my decision to pick up the Dirty Prose aftershave.",

I would butcher the actual name so I'm not attempting to spell it. It's quite spicy and almost cologne like. I can't identify a single note in the scent so it's extremely well blended. It honestly reminds me of an affordable version of Nuavia. Especially this scent due to its cologne nature.\n\nLike all sw soaps, it's vegan but in my experience it's one of the best vegan soaps I've tried. The lather density and slickness is such that you might forget it's not tallow. I think the post shave and residual slickness is improved in this version. It's possible that the lather felt a tiny bit more airy than the prior base I tested, but that might have been user error. In any event it was no issue. It's a very good base.",

That was a long day.\n\nMemories aside, I have fallen in love with Roam. This is an excellent colder weather scent for Autumn and Winter, and is so complex in how the notes change from off the tub, to lather, to the AS being on the skin. Just the way the sweet tobacco, damp earth and smoke play around each other... almost like dancing between a cloud of pipe smoke, a spicy aromatic, and a gourmand delicacy. Paired with the bourbon-y Winter Reserve Bay Rum from my local barbershop, this must be what gentlemen cowboys smell like in heaven.",

This is probably my favorite soap base with the scent that was voted as being the best made by an artisan. Do I agree with this assessment of the greatest scent as voted by the community? Absolutely not. Do I enjoy this scent? Absolutely, this scent reminds me of being a classy old person. I wonder if this soap will help with back problems....",

      "body": "SOTD 9/11/18\n\nSEptember continues, though with a DE guest star. Why? Two reasons,,, First, Shave one with the Supply Injector was brutal and the idea of another 4 or 5 shaves with that uninterrupted seemed too bleak.\n\nSecond, I've seen a lot of posts where a dude shaves with SE for two weeks and gets religion - \"I'm never using a DE again, SE is so much better, how could I have been so blind?\" - and I wanted to avoid being that guy. So alternating DE and SE for at least some of the month seemed like a fun idea.\n\nThe designated DE is the ATT Windsor (in increasingly patinaed copper) with the R1 plate and a Polisilver blade. Sharp blade, held very rigidly, so perhaps pretty close to what characteristics are usually seen in SE.\n\nReason One is less valid now as Shave Two with the Supply yesterday was much better in all ways - fewer weepers, no irritation at all, and an 8 hr BBS. But I'll continue the rotation for the sake of Science...\n\n* Razor: ATT Windsor R1\n* Blade: Polisilver (2)\n* Soap: WK Agrumi In Estate (Summer Citrus)\n* Brush: 24mm C&R aluminum Victorian w Gamechanger synth\n* Post: Pacific Shaving Caffeinated After Shave Balm\n* Frag: Bvlgari Aqva EDT\n\n* Product Notes:\n\n* Razor & Blade: another perfect shave from this combo, as good as any SE shave I've had with AC or Injector.\n\n* Post Shave: The ingredient list makes this one seem like it would kick all kinds of ass, but in practice it is a decent balm, not exceptional, and one more than equaled by other Big Box brands. Still pleasant and effective to use as long as the shave did not beat my face up too much, and today was such a case.\n\n* Soap: Another excellent shave from WK DM tallow. Will compare this to the same brand and scent cream tomorrow, but this to me is a top three base (others = Reserve, Eufros). The scent was a really complex citrus with layers of spice and earthiness.\n\n* Frag: Aqva is an oceanic for malcontents, a dark, bitter sort of vegetal scent mixed in with citrus and calone. Petitgrain and clary sage add to the complexity and keep things from being all light and airy. Maybe the ideal Indian Summer frag, but the round completely curved bottle makes storage an annoyance. Looks clever though!",

I got a bit of a different angle of scent today from the tub. It reminded me quite a bit of *Cuir et Epices* but with less edge.\n\nThis isn't bad, I love Cuir et Epices. It just surprised me some, since in all the times I've used Flying Hide, it never hit me quite like this. Interesting how scents can be fluid like that.\n\nOff to the range to train for a bit before work. Happy Tuesday ya'll.",

Since I don't have any more barbershop samples I really like, I decided a Declaration brush ought to get its first use with a Declaration (L&L) soap. Catalan's Prairie is a wonderful floral that's deeper and richer (in this user's opinion) than B&M's Tuesday. Great brush, great soap, great shave.\n\nToday is one of those days that, for folks of a certain age, you just can't ever feel right about. It's picture day at the local middle school and when I saw it on their sign a week ago, I just got a lump in my chest and thought \"couldn't they have picked a different day?\". 17 years ago, I was getting my CS degree at UK (after deciding radio would never pay enough, but that's a different story). I was listening to the AM news station on the drive to campus and just as I was getting there, they broke the news about a plane of indeterminate size hitting the WTC. They didn't know if the plane was large or small, if it was a tragic accident or something more sinister. And so I went to class. There was no wifi, nobody had laptops, cellular data wasn't a thing yet. When I got out of class 90 minutes later, there was no more WTC, the Pentagon had been hit, and a plane had gone down in Pennsylvania. And I feel like our country changed, not necessarily for the better.\n\nThere was other stuff that happened that day. Important stuff that probably would have been life changing for me if it hadn't been overshadowed by the one big thing. But what's the use of dwelling on it all? I want to take a moment and thank all of you who have given of yourselves in service whether that service was military or civic. Y'all keep the wheels turning so the rest of us can enjoy the ride.",

I don't think he'll be joining our ranks haha. He was complaining about how big of a mess the lather was making and made it a point to point out every time he got a weeper (only 3 times btw, which I thought was pretty good). He also complained about how long it took. He did at least like the aftershave I had him use (B&M Reserve Spice) and I sent him home with a few of those sample packets of aftershave.\n\nFirst time using the Vide Poche. It's almost too floral for me, but I actually like it quite a bit. Second time using Icarus and this time was even better than the first. The Bon Vivant pairs pretty well with it.",

This was a sample I got some time ago, and after smelling it, I decided to get the matching aftershave balm. The scent is nice. It has a very warm, comforting, and somewhat sweet smell to me. I would definitely recommend it as a classic barbershop to anyone.\n\nStirling's soap performance is great. You start off adding water slowly as you lather and eventually, the soap blows up, and then right after that with a bit more water it becomes nicely slick. Really easy to use in my opinion, and always gives solid results.\n\nHope everyone is having a great Tuesday.",

I'm surprised I don't see it mentioned more often on shaving subs. I received it as a throw-in sample on a hardware order from Etsy, but had not heard of it prior to that. The scent is nice (pretty conventional barbershop) but where it really stands out is slickness/cushion. My first pass was super efficient and near effortless, and by the 3rd pass there was barely any stubble left to pick off. No nicks or weepers and an excellent post-shave softness to my skin. Followed with Nivea--which used to be my default post-shave but I haven't used as often since I delved into alcohol-based splashes. I still like Nivea but it does have a slight residual film (and no cooling action on this one) so I'll probably save the rest of this for the ~6 weeks of winter weather we get in LA ;-)",

I only wish I had more!\nI did not think I would dig a rose scent, but Cracklin' Rosie has just enough smoke in it to keep the rose from being powerful.\nThe lather was amazing! I put a shmear in my bowl about the size I use for any soap I bowl lather with, and the soap exploded almost immediately into a thick, billowy cushion. I was truly impressed by how much lather I got from such a small amount of soap pressed in to the bowl.\nPinaud Clubman was a great pairing with it. And as floral as it is, I can actually detect some of the smoke left over from my lather.\nThis soap being a limited release, I am sorry I missed the boat on it.

We should be okay. We've got supplies. And if the power is out for too long ... and it will go out ... we can just head inland to stay with relatives and friends. We are inland enough so that we should not get hit with it while it's at hurricane strength. But it'll get nasty. Maybe 60 mph winds, last time I looked. Main danger for us is prolonged power outage.\n\n[Video](https://youtu.be/WKXdND-dz9E)\n\n**General Notes / Exec Summary / TL;DR**\nSo maybe this soap is the one of mine that changes the most from the tub to the lather. And not in the way I was hoping.\n\n**Razor and Blade Notes** - *Wolfman - WR1 SB .67 Polished with Gillette - Nacet (42)*\nRazor did well. Keeping the right angle with it is becoming more natural.\n\nAnd the blade just keeps on chugging along. 42 uses? Whatever. Ain't nobody got time fo dat.\n\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Few hairs are showing some tip length (with most being cut flush)\n\n**Soap Notes** - *Southern Witchcrafts - Pomona*\nThis is SW original base, and is a good performer. Not luxuriously slick, but good. Especially considering the great price point.\n\n1/4 tsp of soap was just right for me with 3tsp water.\n\nThe scent off the tub was intoxicating. Apple so rich and sweet and tart all at the same time, made so by red wine and honey. It's one of those scents that words just don't do justice. How unique and enjoyable, I thought.\n\nBut the catch is ... that is the amazing scent that comes from the tub. Much of that sweetness and wine never makes it to the lather, at least in a concentration that I could discern. I was left with a light apple essence combined with what I assume is honeysuckle. Not bad, but maybe a 3/10 for scent strength.\n\nI was so hoping for the other scents to come through in the lather.\n\nOh, and at the trailing end, I could swear I smelled some cinnamon.\n\n\n**Brush Notes** - *Declaration Grooming - B5 24mm Badger*\nStill a tad too backboney for me, but it's young. We'll give it plenty more shaves to loosen up, hopefully.\n\n----\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger**\n\nUse this to document how long our blades last, if you want, and what about them made us pitch 'em. I created a Google Form with just a few questions:\n\n[Ending of Blades Ledger](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform)\n\n[The Ledger Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing) in case you want to just look at the data.\n\nI'll keep this as my footer each SOTD so you have the link. I'll take it down if no one shows interest.\n",

Druantia is completely different. Very spicy and warm. And the scent strength is significant. Very nicely done.\n\nA word about the base. It is a noticeable improvement over the old base. The attribute that stood out the most for me was the improved slickness and residual slickness. I had to buff a little in my problem spot and just a dab of water was all I needed. The soap's residual slickness was significant.\n\nOff to get to it.",

Everyone knows and loves Declaration's Icarus base and the Contemplation smell is pretty much the epitome of a summer day. With fall rapidly approaching (although here in the south it's just the leaves falling. The heat lingers for a while), I wanted to start changing up my scents and such. So I went with Fougere Gothique and damn do I still love this smell. Even though it's supposedly a darker smell and has that hint of decomposition in it, it also has that hit of dirt in the foreground that really brings my mind back to helping my dad in his garden when I was a child.",

Good stuff, but it seems like the bases that have come out since might have caught up. It's super quick and easy to create an encouraging lather that's rich and slick. This toner really is something although the scent seems a bit off, it immediately jumps the quality of the post shave face feel up a measurable amount. I find the scent close enough to and not quite as good as Bandwagon so I think it's finally time to make a tough decision and move it on.",

When I've read about people's Reserve struggles, I've seen that the advice is almost always \"less soap, more water, and more water.\" So I've been trying to fix my shitty Reserve lathers by loading less soap and using more water. Surely I'm making the same mistake everyone else makes, right?\n\nNOPE. I've been underloading from the start. So each time I've tried Reserve, I've built a worse and worse lather. Last night that pattern hit its inevitable and hilarious end when the suds gave up and just evaporated off my face in the middle of my second pass. So I went back for more soap before the third pass, and I wound up with a _lather_ instead of something that looked like the sad remains of a bubble bath twenty minutes after you've drained the tub. And _damn_ was it slick, and damn did my face feel good afterward.\n\nSo finally, I'm actually excited to use Reserve. And now that I get the lather, I can focus on figuring out how I feel about Spice...",

I have the B&M Hallows on the way from pre-order whenever that is ready to ship, but I also have stuff I want to get from Stirling, Catie's Bubbles, Wholy Klaw, Declaration Grooming, and others, and need the space to be able to store them (and so I can tell my wife I need more because I'm running out of stuff).\n\nHowever, today is one of those days where I just needed to go with something on the top end of the scale. Enter, Stirling Executive Man. Now, this product is nothing new to people here so I won't go into any hyperbolic descriptions and reviews about it, and we'll just suffice to say that my face feels great and the rich, heavy scent is perfect for a cloudy, rainy and warm day in the Philadelphia area.\n\nThe big thing here though is the blade, Racer Super Stainless. I wrote last week about it in that it is incredibly sharp, right up there with Feather and Muhle for me, and that I as a fan of sharp and aggressive blades really like the Racer. I am now on shave nine with this blade and it still is cutting through the hair exceptionally well. I did have issues on my lip today, but that was my fault. I had already decided to add Racer blades to my regular rotation with Feather and Muhle, but if these can last 10+ shaves I could buy a 100 pack each of Feather, Muhle and Racer and never need to buy blades again.",

      "body": "SOTD Wed 9/12\n\nSEptember continues - after using two AC razors in the earlier days of the month, am smack in the middle of using a Supply Injector, alternating with a \"SE Simulator\", ATT Windsor w Polisilver DE blade.\n\n* Razor: Supply Injector\n* Blade: Personna Injector (3)\n* Soap: Noble Otter Barrbar\n* Brush: Elite 26mm Manchurian bulb in red jasper handle\n* Post: Duke Cannon Cooling Balm\n* Frag: Van Cleef & Arpels Tsar EDT\n\n* Product Notes:\n\n* Razor / Blade: Best shave yet from this combo - uneventful, BBS from a three pass. The handle is great, pretty to look at, easy to use. The Personna blade is holding up well, feels like it has at least another 3-4 shaves in it.\n\n* The Personna Injector is more or less as sharp as say an Astra SP or Wilkinson (German) Sword. Looks to have a longer effective life span. The Supply / injector combo has none of the \"wow\" factor of a good AC razor - the blade does not feel as thick or as sharp as an AC, but the Supply razor does keep it nice and rigid. I would say this combo is not going to win anyone over from DE shaving, but the pairing remains a solid daily shaver with a nice handle and considerable retro appeal. If you are not a daily shaver, I would recommend getting the more aggressive (three dot) plate from Supply rather than the two dot plate that I am using.\n\n* Soap: Saddened by this. Love the scent, and the new packaging, and that cute lil otter makes me smile as I start the shave. That smile has faded to a grimace by the end of the shave, as I am shouting in my brain \"Need post shave NOW!!!\". This was the same feeling with the injector as it has been with numerous other DE shaves with varying razors and blades when using NO.\n\n* Not sure if it is a lack of cushion or poor post shave or both, but NO reminds me a lot of Shannon's - a tallow soap that feels like a mid range performance vegan soap. I would put Caties and Glissant above NO, and those soaps are in my second tier, so the Otter is down in the \"gentlemen's B+\" range.\n\n* It's not the end of the world; a good post shave makes everything nice again in five minutes or less and things stay fine thereafter. But to me the mark of a great performing soap is when I end the shave thinking \"hm, maybe I don't need a post shave\". After about 12-15 tries, I am not getting there with the Otter.\n\n* I do love the brand though, and they've made huge strides from V1 to this version, and I hope they will do a bit more fine tuning. Slickness and lather efficiency is excellent, and I am sure shavers with less princess / pea sort of faces than meself will do just fine with this iteration of the formula.\n\n* Post Shave: Duke Cannon got to play fireman today and help my beat up face. The balm performed admirably, cooling and soothing in a minute or so and left my skin smooth and moisturized. The sandalwood smell was a bit more apparent with this use.\n\n* Frag: If I was made to pick one fragrance to wear for all purposes for the rest of my life, Tsar would probably be that scent. A complex elegant fougere with notes of artemisia, juniper, tarragon, and coriander in the top / middle with a truly epic drydown that goes through all sorts of phases.\n\n* This is the War and Peace of fragrances, and so will not appeal to those who want subtle, minimalist olfactory experiences. But as for me, I say let us return to the freezing steppes, the elegant drawing rooms, the onion dome cathedrals, the steaming spas, and the clash of empires....\n\n* Plus, also like War & Peace, Tsar is cheap! $ 24...\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Van-Cleef-Arpels-Toilette-Ounces/dp/B000CNP4HO/ref=sr_1_2_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1536758977&sr=8-2&keywords=van+cleef+tsar\n",

And knowing how much I love the base for my first few uses of Reserve Lavender (both soap and splash), I'll double up with probably two tubs and two aftershaves of Seville in Reserve if Will ever does another run. It's that good, and I think it would be my one scent if I was forced to pick a single scent in wet shaving for the rest of my days.\n\nThe shave was good, and I'm back to pitching blades after 3 uses I think. The drop off from 4 onward is slight but noticeable, and given price per blade, life is too short to ride that out any further. I've taken a step back from my infatuation with the slant I got back in late July and am back to using this vintage Gillette as a daily driver for awhile. It feels so mild on my face, but gives a really nice shave.\n\nSlow day at work with no meetings, so I should be able to tackle a good bit of core work. Happy Wednesday, all.",

I really love this scent. It was in the second batch of samples I ordered from Stirling some time ago. I have used it a bunch since then, but still have plenty of the sample left which speaks for Stirling sample sizes. The scent is really refreshing in my opinion. It is light and crisp and reminds me of being outdoors on a somewhat cooler day with the wind blowing by. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who hasn't tried it.\n\nAs for the performance, I've said it before, but Stirling offers great performance for a great price. Easy to lather and explodes once you add in enough water. Had plenty of soap today for three passes and had an irritation free shave. Followed it up with alum and then finished off with a matching aftershave. The aftershave is a bit warmer smelling to me (probably because of the alcohol) but still smells great. Solid shave today.\n\nHave a great Wednesday everyone!",

I've accumulated about 4 Dapper Dragon samples and hadn't tried any of them. Green Dragon was the first to pass the sniff test. It's an interesting scent, almost like a fougere but not quite. It's not listed anywhere on the description but I thought I picked up a faint scent of Eucalyptus, like a slight medicinal note. There's also a sweeter top note on opening the jar that I want to say is amber (reminded me of the sweetness of Latha Sandalwood). Lathered in a bowl and at first I got a lot of bubbles (thought I left too much water in the brush) but I kept swirling and eventually the bubbles went away and I got a sort of \"low structure\" lather that reminded me of the Reserve line. The performance was excellent. This was the first time in 6 months of wet shaving that I didn't use any alum, styptic, or witch hazel. Just a cold rinse and then finish off with Summer Storm splash (already becoming one of my favorites--I just purchased a full size bottle recently).",

It still turns out that the badger brush needs a good deal more soap/loading to yield the same amount of lather on my face. I worked harder on loading and building more at the start rather than just accepting a runny and overly-thin lather. I think I have pushed this blade to its limit for me as I am a little sore under the chin with some irritation, likely not helped by my fledgling shaving skills but keeping a fresher blade (<6 shaves) usually yields better results for me. I picked a different SW splash today, and this one is fall in a bottle. I look forward to pairing it with the soap, but it gave me a wonderful impression of spice and leaves in the woods. I wish the weather here was truly fall-like, but we are getting closer every day.",

I acquired the razor from the bazaar and this is actually the first time I've used it. The M2 plate is advertised as the mildest plate, so I had set my expectations accordingly. I shave regularly, so I didn't foresee it as a problem. The blade gap is small, and the only thing that bothers me is the gap is so small that there was build-up from the start of the shave, so stubborn that I had to disassemble it to clean the gunk off the blade. The shave itself was impressive and it'll be fun using it regularly, but I wonder if it was the cream vs the razor itself.\n\nRetail for the St. James in the states is actually the most expensive set in my collection because the aftershave gel is so expensive ($35). Even the Seville in Reserve set ($50) cost less that this set ($60). The scent on the gel has no staying power and the post-shave doesn't feel any different than a $10 balm, in my opinion. If I had to do it over, I'd pay the same amount for the matching cologne and find an unscented splash. That said, the cream is fantastic and the reason I got the gel in the first place. After a month and a half of using Proraso, you forget just how creamy and slick other bases can be. I didn't mind how long it took me to dial in the lather because of how good it smells.\n\nGood shaving, guys.\n\n",

I've been curious to try A&E, and it's a nice performer. The goat milk adds a lot of creaminess to the lather, and its quite nourishing. The scent is also pleasant. I don't think it's quite as good as WK, but it's definitely good. Slickness, lather density and post shave are all excellent.",

The soap base is fantastic. Easy to load and relatively thirsty but man does it pay off when you get the water amount dialed in! Luxurious foam that has tons of slickness and cushion. Post shave feel is pretty phenomenal as well. I've been playing with my adjustable this week and I THINK I like it best on the \"6\" setting but I'm still not quite sure yet. I haven't really played with it since I've gotten better with my technique, so what better time than now. Oh, and as for the scent of the soap and splash, it's really refreshing with the open kick of the juniper that mellows out into an almost muted green scent of the fir, sage, and oakmoss. It's really a lovely thing and exactly what I needed this mornin.",

Cloudy through mid morning, then gradual clearing, with a high near 73. Calm wind becoming southeast around 5 mph in the afternoon. High tide at 2:40 this afternoon.\n\nThis actually fits Theme Thursday. I think all told for the soap and aftershave was right around $100. The soap is a very nice performer, you just have to drown it in water. Think Reserve Soap levels of water, but even more.\n\nI was not looking forward to head-lathering with a 24mm brush, but it didn't take me that long. First time using this brush, and it doesn't seem like there is a lot of backbone, so that might have helped on the head lathering bit. It did seem just a tad toward the scrubby side of the spectrum, but we'll see how that softens up during the next few shaves.\n\nMy wife asked me what aftershave I used today cause it smells like old ginger ale. The kind that has been sitting out for a day and a half. After she said that I could totally smell it too. I don't know about anyone else, but it also seems to have given me a slight spray-tan tinge of orange to my face and head, further testing is required.",

Something from them will probably be my next full tub purchase. However, that won't be Bandwagon since I'm not crazy about barbershop scents. They are generally pretty much fine, but I can almost not smell Bandwagon. Plus there are so many great CL scents that I have a lot to choose from.",

It is my go to cold/wet scent. It wasn't quite cold enough or wet enough last night and I actually got a different sensation smelling it than usual, especially out of the aftershave. I can't remember quite what it was, but my memory says leather that I hadn't noticed before. It's almost like it clashed with the weather for the first time, whereas usually it blends so perfectly that nothing stands out. I'll have to keep this one tucked away for another month or two, but that doesn't bother me because I can't hardly stomach the thought of winter coming.",

It was smokier and muskier than I had anticipated from the label and reviews. I expected the leather to be more akin to Noble Otter's Flying Hide, but this seems like a more cologne-y leather? (I know some descriptions say \"russian leather\" but I'm not sure what that means in terms of scent.)\n\nI really like the sweeter, more coffee forward scent of the aftershave.\n\nAs a seasonal scent, this one totally earned its reputation. I can easily see wanting to use this one on a cool fall day, or after fall yard work, etc.",

The scent is a very pleasant woodsy/spicy combo that would be great for late fall or winter. I'll reserve my full thoughts on performance for when I finish the sample, but for now I will say that it is an improvement over v1 which was already very good. I think I started with too much water in the knot though. It's weird going back to a synthetic brush after using badger exclusively for a while. I should've started with a dryer brush as synths tend to dump all the water as soon as you start loading. Things were easily recovered into a nice, creamy slick lather by loading some more soap.",

Classic is an offering in the B&M reserve base and is an awesome soap. For me, the scent is alright. Honestly, it's probably my least favorite of the reserve soaps. I think that is just because it is too powdery to me. I am a big fan of barbershop type scents, but this one doesn't quite reach the levels some other do. With that said, it is still a good scent, just not really for me.\n\nThe performance on the other hand is awesome. All the reserve soaps are the same in this regard: once dialed in and a LOT of water is added, I produces some of the best lathers around. Followed the shave up with the matching aftershave and left my face feeling great. The reserve aftershave is as good, if not better than the soap, and is probably my favorite feeling aftershave out. Highly recommend trying one if you haven't yet.\n\nHappy Thursday everyone. Almost the weekend.",

Yesterdays Injector shave (my third) only gave me a stubble free face for 5 hours, similar to my first injector shave, with the middle 8 hr BBS from injector as the outlier.\n\n* By comparison, the Windsor R1 seems to be giving me 9 hrs + of BBS consistently with generally more pleasant post shave feel in the process.\n\n* Cream: Free WK sample of their new cream base. I was impressed! Shaved exactly as good as tallow, with none of the drying I experience from Brit / Euro creams. I presume this is due to the tallow / DM combo, a rare thing in shaving creams!\n\n* Good to see a cold process soap can hang with the hot blooded bases, and great to see WK succeeding in a new experiment! Along with B&M, Sri is one of the great experimenters in the artisan wet shaving field, and its great to see hard work and imagination pay off...",

This is because for my first pass, it's not too smooth, and on the last pass, I have to watch my technique to avoid irritation. I wanted more of a comfortable daily driver.\n\nThen it hit me that I've been using the same blade since August and it is on 42 uses ... and that *just might* be the culprit. So I threw a young buck into the razor and went at it. Stellar.\n\nThe Soap ... a little too feminine for me, but that version 2 from Dr. Jon's is a great base!\n\n**Razor and Blade Notes** - *Wolfman - WR1 SB .67 Polished with Gillette - Silver Blue (4)*\nThis blade is just a tot compared to my 42-use Nacet. Felt great. Looks like the head may be just right for me after all. Great, efficient, consistent, and smooth shave!\n\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Smooth\n*Neck*: Smooth\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Very Close Shave\n\n**Soap Notes** - *Dr Jon's - 1805*\nWhile the base is fantastic in its smoothness, slickness, and glide... the scent just wasn't for me. Their write-up says that it is fruity, floral, and musky ... while still being masculine. Well, that's subjective, and especially in lather form (and even moreso at the end), when the florals are more dominant, it's just too feminine for me. There are a ton of notes in this one, and maybe if the woody and musky ones were more dominant, I could see it swaying back my way.\n\n\n**Brush Notes** - *Whipped Dog - Silvertip 22mm Tall Handle*\nAs I keep alternating back and forth with the Declaration B5, the lack of backbone in this one becomes more and more evident. We'll see, over time, if this is a good thing or not! I love how it's lighter on my face, and soft that way. But I have to have my lather right, or it feels pretty dry.\n\n----\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger**\n\nUse this to document how long our blades last, if you want, and what about them made us pitch 'em. I created a Google Form with just a few questions:\n\n[Ending of Blades Ledger](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform)\n\n[The Ledger Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing) in case you want to just look at the data.\n\nI'll keep this as my footer each SOTD so you have the link. I'll take it down if no one shows interest.\n",

Today, I scooped significantly more into my bowl and got a really good lather. Tomorrow, I think I'm just going to empty the remaining test soap into my sample bowl and pretend it's a full puck until it's all gone.\n\nI like the Druantia scent. Haven't seen scent notes, but it's definitely a semi-spicy winter smell. Like maybe gingerbread cookies coming out of the oven at the rectory connected to the [Church of Starry Wisdom](http://lovecraft.wikia.com/wiki/Church_of_Starry_Wisdom) in Dunwich. Or maybe it's the bowl of potpurri they set out in Hill House when the seasons take a turn for the cooler.\n\nAs for the Theme Thursday aspect, the shave soap sample was actually a surprise freebie included with a different freebie, making it double-free and thus the cheapest soap sample I've got.",

The Reserve Classic soap & splash samples were acquired for free (PIF). The Omega 10049 (my first brush) is the cheapest piece of hardware I've purchased (got it on sale for $5.99 from Italian Barber!), while the Game Changer is the most expensive ($55). 6 months into the hobby, I think my RAD and BAD have been mostly sated (very happy with the Game Changer, and with my Zenith Boar)...but no matter how much software I acquire, I'm always finding new stuff I want to try. I try to enforce a \"sample first\" rule, which gives me a lot more variety for the buck and keeps spending under control. Sample October, anyone?",

I don't want to list everyone - you all know who you are - but I did want to give special thanks to /u/Hyvasuomi79 who's been more than helpful and friendly as a fellow shaver in my local community. To keep it going, I'm adding some of the software I've acquired and some new stuff as a PIF prize for the Sample September winners.\n\nOn today's shave, I had always been intrigued but apprehensive about Sherlock. I personally liked the smell, but any tobacco/leather or similar scents were suspected by the wife. Once she got into Roam, I felt more comfortable experimenting with more aggressive scents (LPT: happy wife, happy life)... which brings us to Sherlock. It reminds me of Roam, but less smoky off the top and more of a powdery note out of the tub. During and after shaving, the scent stayed on but did not explode the way some other scents do, which felt appropriate; this isn't an in your face scent suited for someone at a rave, but moreso an elegant yet unapologetically masculine imagination of what would have collected upon Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's detective while in his study and while pursuing the chase in Victorian London.\n\nOnly after picking out the fragrance by smell, did the irony of using Baker Street dawn on me. A fantastic shave today, in more ways than one.",

The weight feels quite good, but the knurl can be a bit harsh, especially when trying to shake the water free between passes. I complained yesterday that I had stubborn lather that wasn't escaping the blade gap. I thought perhaps it was the cream I was using, but even today with this there was some residual lather when I disassembled it. I feel that will bother me. The head feels just a bit more mild than the V3A was I using before, so the shave quality hasn't skipped a beat. We'll see how much longer I can push the blade, this is the longest I've taken one.\n\nGood shaving, guys.\n\n",

Both are excellent bases, and clearly are elite in all aspects. Reserve does behave more like a cream and takes a little more time to get right. Pp7 seems more like a soap and is a bit easier to dial in. Reserve seems a bit fattier and for lack of a better term, snotty, which adds to its slickess. I'm looking forward to pp8 reviews soon.",

Dr. Jon's soap base is wonderful and we all know that. For a vegan base, it sure doesn't behave like one! Plenty of slickness and cushion for three passes with no problems. I figured I'd start using up some of the B&M aftershave samples as well, so I reached for a sample of Reserve Spice. Believe it or not, I got a dud. The damn thing was completely empty! That was a bit of a letdown, seeing as how I'd gotten my mind set on using it and tore open the package to reveal...nothing. Seemed cartoonish to an extent. I ended up using Reserve Classic though which is still a fantastic aftershave. Smells pretty damn classically wonderful and the skin feel after is something that no other aftershave can compare to! I paired this all with a use of my sample of Bull's Blood because why the fuck not. Today shall be a wonderful day today!",

So I decided to try out Shore today. This is my first time using the Icarus base and overall, it was a very nice shave. I can see what people are talking about with the \"animal funk\" smell off the puck but it does go away pretty quickly when lathered and you get a nice scent that I can't really describe other than it does smell like a day at the ocean. Sandy, ocean water, etc. The aftershave smelled mostly like menthol and then was so light that I couldn't really smell once it dried down but it felt really good. The soap is top notch and didn't require a ton of effort to dial in. I have been using Reserve a lot lately and it is pretty similar to that in terms of lathering.",

Today is back to Summer weather. Time to break out APR *Pamuzu* that was generously sent my way to keep me from being so damn angry. This is a nice, tart mix of white grapefruit and yuzu. To give the aftershave a good test, I used alum, rinsed and then applied the aftershave. This stuff is truly top-notch. Terrific face feel and great citrus scent. Well done, /u/ntownuser!!\nGreat Friday shaves to all.",

This was the last of my sample, and I am sad to see it go. The fragrance is really solid. It has a somewhat smokey scent, not overly so at all, and kind of just reminds me of an old school fragrance. Almost like a mix of something your dad would wear, but with more of an edge/ cool feel to it. Hopefully that makes sense. I don't want to give off that it is something an old man would wear, but rather is something every guy would enjoy.\n\nHad a very good shave today. The lather whipped up no problem, and provided great protection and slickness. I followed it up with the matching aftershave splash and have been smelling good all day. I noticed I keep smelling my hands for the residual fragrance and I've really been enjoying it. I have to buy a full tub of this at some point.\n\nFinally made it to Friday everyone. Have a great last day to the work week!",

The only other Fern I've tried has had florals in it that sent it over into a more feminine bent. It was awesome to experience this fern without any undue encumbrances.\n\nHurricane Florence Notes: tonight, at this very moment, we're getting the outer rain bands of the hurricane. It did slow down in intensity today, and changed direction a bit, so I think we're not going to get anything super serious, other than maybe 7 inches of rain in the next few days. Safe so far! God bless our public servants who are out in it saving lives!\n\nUpdate: At the time of posting, we just experienced a lot of rain and pretty high winds over the evening, but nothing really serious. Well, except for my Internet going down.\n\n**Razor and Blade Notes** - *Wolfman - WR1 SB .67 Polished with Gillette - Nacet (43)*\nAnother strong shave with this venerable blade. No irritation.\n\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Few hairs are showing some tip length (with most being cut flush)\n\n**Soap Notes** - *Barrister & Mann - Beaudelaire*\nLoved the scent. Fern is great, and is softened by the ylang ylang into something very nice.\n\nI'm going to have to investigate other similar \"pure\" fern scents. Or maybe mix my own with some sweet fruit soaps I have.\n\n1/4- tsp with 2.5 tsp water was too thin, but it worked out. So maybe try just 2 tsp next time.\n\nSlickness was top notch as usual.\n\nPaired pretty well with Tallow + Steel Classic.\n\n\n**Brush Notes** - *Declaration Grooming - B5 24mm Badger*\nReally enjoyed this brush this time.\n\n----\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger**\n\nUse this to document how long our blades last, if you want, and what about them made us pitch 'em. I created a Google Form with just a few questions:\n\n[Ending of Blades Ledger](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform)\n\n[The Ledger Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing) in case you want to just look at the data.\n\nI'll keep this as my footer each SOTD so you have the link. I'll take it down if no one shows interest.",

      "body": "SOTD Friday 9/14\n\nSEptember Phase II (Injector Versus Windsor DE) comes to a close...\n\n* Razor: Supply Injector w Lvl II plate\n* Blade: Personna Injector (4)\n* Soap: Talbot Shaving Governor's Island\n* Brush: Simpson Duke 3 Best 23mm\n* Post: Duke Cannon Cooling balm\n* Frag: Penhaligons Sartorial EDT\n\n* Product Notes:\n* Razor / Blade: A \"good\" shave today in terms of stubble elimination and post shave feel. The Supply has given me one excellent and one good shave of four, leaving two bad shaves charged. One of the bad shaves was probably due to it being my first use of the system, and the other was probably due to using a less than optimal soap.\n\n* Compared to that, the Windsor R1 w Poli is 3 for 3 \"excellent\" shaves with ultra efficient stubble shearing and excellent post shave face feel on all occasions.\n\n* The Supply is definitely fun to use and the Injector blades have a retro appeal and seem to have a very long life. But the combo of a nice handle and a middling blade has little \"wow\" factor, and will likely not be converting many DE shavers in the way that AC or GEM shaves seem to be capable of doing.\n\n* Where Supply shines is in winning over cart shavers who want something with minimal option overload and simplicity, someone who appreciates Old Skool and wants a nicely made handle.\n\n* Another potential use of the Supply is as a travel razor. Not tried this meself as I am still checking a bag circa 1999, but I think the TSA folks do not mind a handle but only blades, meaning one could have the Supply in a carry on and then restock blades when you get to your destination. Most pharmacies seem to carry injectors (not quite sure why, but many do...) so this is certainly a more enjoyable option than using a penalty multiblade cart with vibrating handle and E-Z Pivot action when on the road.\n\n* Soap: My third shave with the ultra elusive brand. Scent design is brilliant, performance roughly an A -. Not quite as good as Reserve, Eufros, or Icarus, but in the same ballpark as Caties, Declaration basic, and Glissant. I'm glad I own this particular soap, but will not move mountains or jump through flames to get another iteration of it.\n\n* Frag: Many loathe the scent design of Sartorial, but I love it. Many also criticize the scent for short life - though for me it lasts more than 8 hours. It's a great \"story\" perfume attempting to detail the life of a 19th Cent English tailor in scent. Apparently those dudes had a lot of metal, ozone, wood, and sweetness in their lives! Either another triumph by Duchaufour or him \"phoning it in\" for an under-budgeted brief, depending on one's interpretation...",

I scooped out a fairly typical amount of soap into my bowl, yet ended up with way more lather than I needed (SOTD pic has about 1/3 of it on my brush) and (probably?) enough soap still left in the bowl for another shave tomorrow. The cushion and glide were exceptional. I was easily buffing over areas without any visible lather. Encouraged by this unusually good performance, I even went ATG on my neck (something I've never attempted before) and got my closest-ever BBS shave, with zero nicks. Kudos to u/rocketk455 Great job on this one. Now I just need to try some other scents in the line (not a knock on this soap--I'm only lukewarm on Barbershop scents in general). Any recommendations?",

The new base seems denser and more protective and has improved slickness.\n\nI should have used a Dogwood Handcrafts brush yesterday with SW soap, but I had a brain fart. This bulb knot which I dropped into this handle is finally starting to come around. I have a mixed fan in my other Dogwood handle which I prefer to the bulb. That may change as this knot breaks in more.\n\nSaturday chores are calling.",

Got another awful airy lather at first, but I think I finally get it: assuming all else is equal, when I lather in the scuttle, my brush is pointed downward, so more water finds its way into the lather faster. When I face lather, the brush is mostly angled so that gravity pulls the water in the brush _away_ from the lather.\n\nSo basically, next time I do the scuttle, I'll go in with a drier brush and see if that changes things.\n\nToday starts moving weekend. Here we go. The thing keeping me sane is just knowing that it'll be pretty much over tomorrow.",

It has quickly become my favourite head shaver, it's so fun and rewarding to use. Now I just need to find the best blade.\n\nHave a great weekend!",

I met a guy from DFS who was selling me something, figured out he lived pretty close so he drove over to my place and we talked wetshaving for a while lol, too long I care to admit. Anyway, he brought samples of every Talbot soap, Lavender Creeper and some other good stuff. I was amazed by his generosity with that. He also brought me a B2 SSB as he knew i was looking for one, iwas amazed! AMAZED! Of course it wasnt free, i traded him for it but it just goes to show you that we all love the hobby and im glad we have the Maggard meet ups and other ones around the country for us to interact face to face.\n\nAlso is /u/fuckchalzone who kindly sent me some Wade & Butcher Curved blades to fit my W&B DE since I was just using a regular blade with it (Its suppose to use curved blades) It was very nice, as I seen the blades on Ebay for quite a lot of money for collectors im assuming, because when I shaved with it this morning....it wasn't cutting any hair lol! The blades seem to have dulled or you have to sharpen them or something, I don't know but it wasn't shaving like its suppose to. Either way, I just whipped out the fatboy and finished my shave.\n\nThe lavender creeper is almost like a croap, I wasn't expecting that, thinking it was more of a hard soap. Either way, I didnt think it was bad or horrible, but I did not think it was worth the price, considering all the artisans we have on here that produce excellent soaps for an excellent price.\n\nHappy shaving guys.",

Executive Man is a classic, and paired with a Creed Aventus decant will make for a great pairing as a wedding guest. As for the shave, it was one of my best in a long, long time. Everything felt right, and it was comfortable and close on one day of growth. Things that changed from my normal routine: 1- Used hot water instead of cold water throughout the shave. 2- Face lathered instead of bowl, as my shave bowl doesn't go with me when I travel. 3- I believe my in laws may have softer water than I have at home.\n\nIn any case, I now recognize what the term \"post shave feel\" means. With any of my soaps at home (Stirling, B&M Glissant or Reserve) I never seem to get that type of slickness that almost doesn't even require reapplying between passes. Here, I did. I'm going to try to recreate the shave at home. If the deciding variables are 1 and 2 (hot vs. cold, and face lathering vs. bowl) I'll be in business. If water hardness plays a factor, I may not be able to hit the mark. I still get good shaves at home routinely, but this was a *great* shave.\n\nAnyway, excellent shave, and top tier scent. Wedding today, and heading to Vikings-Packers at Lambeau Field tomorrow. Happy Saturday everyone!",

[It's done](https://giphy.com/gifs/3oKIPf3C7HqqYBVcCk/html5). One more soap down! I have one more Latha (Original) soap to go but it is my travel soap. Le Petit Chypre is a very clean scent. If you are looking for simple, clean, and fresh scent; look no further (or really far as it is no discontinued). The base is very easy to use and creates a lather on par with most soap bases out there. It might be lacking some cushion/protection but still much beter than the foams/gels out there.\n\n---\n\n**Recommendation:** I would recommend this soap base if it wasn't discontinued. The price point was too good for this soap.\n\nIf you like these mini-reviews, smash dat like button and remember to subscribe. Next up? Probably Glissant Lavanille but will be using other soaps before I go down that [funky](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/donkeykong/images/5/52/FunkyTF.png/revision/latest?cb=20140308130438) journey.",

This one needs a lot less than the average American artisan soap, it turns out.\n\nAnd nice to jump back into a mild shave with the Black Beauty. The 44 use Nacet did well in it!\n\n**Razor and Blade Notes** - *Gillette - Super Adjustable (Black Beauty) with Gillette - Nacet (44)*\nStarted at a 4 and took it down to a 3 during the last passes. Tiny bit of irritation... but was calmed easily by balm, and gone in a few mins.\n\nAnd with a targeted touch-up pass, I got crazy good results on my problem neck area! All with a 44 use blade!\n\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Smooth\n*Neck*: Smooth\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Very Close Shave\n*Neck*: Cut flush to where I just see the tips (above average for me)\n\n**Soap Notes** - *Le Pere Lucien - Cologne Fougere*\nThis first try was too airy. Pretty sure I used too much soap, and there just wasn't room to beat it down to condense it.\n\nNext time: 1/8-ish of a tsp maybe.\n\nBut the scent was very nice. Masculine, clean, fresh, grassy. Great morning scent, or spring or summer.\n\nPaired well with my Cella balm IMO.\n\n\n**Brush Notes** - *Virginia Cheng - Silvertip Badger 26mm*\nThis 26mm brush is a bit too big for me. However, unlike when I put it away several months ago, I now have an appreciation for the mid-level of backbone that this knot has. I very much like it. Tips are a little scrubby, but I wonder if more uses will make them more comfy.\n\n----\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger**\n\nUse this to document how long our blades last, if you want, and what about them made us pitch 'em. I created a Google Form with just a few questions:\n\n[Ending of Blades Ledger](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform)\n\n[The Ledger Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing) in case you want to just look at the data.\n\nI'll keep this as my footer each SOTD so you have the link.

Cool is another offering in the reserve base that has a nice, crisp clean smell. It is a little powdery, but not overly so, and does have a somewhat cooling scent to it. The matching aftershave also has a touch of menthol in it that is quite nice. When I say touch, I do mean a very small amount, so if you aren't the biggest menthol fan, this shouldn't scare you away.\n\nThe performance of the reserve base of great. Today's shave produced an awesome lather with top tier slickness and gave my no problems for all three passes. The matching aftershave is super good for the skin and left my face feeling great.\n\nHappy Saturday everyone!",

Another shave with the queen of the druids, Druantia. I don't know what was different today (I guess I used a different, much more voluminous brush?) but the Druantia really showed it's woody side in a way it hadn't previously. The performance continues to be great and the only reason I used any post-shave products today (alum block and splash) was because I went a little too hard on my delicate princess throat meat. I'm officially a big fan of SW's new base and I think it's going to be pretty popular when it becomes available.\n\nToday, the teenbeast is going to the wedding of the sister of the boyfriend she intends to break up with just as soon as she gets a homecoming date who isn't him. The rest of us will probably be doing the grocery shopping while she does that. I'll spend the rest of the morning trying to ram an HDMI cable through the \"smurf tube\" in our living room wall so the Nintendo Switch can be hooked up to the TV without visible wires. I'll also be trying to debug this piece of code I started on yesterday to figure out why I'm getting a ConditionalCheckFailureException every time I try to write a record to the Dynamo table even though I'm *not* using conditional writes.

Elliot 6/8 wedge\n**Post:** Lucky Tiger - Oil of Olay Complete\n\nOkay, so...I came home yesterday to find a package from Will in my mailbox. WTF? I didn't order anything. Upon opening it I found a tub of the test batch PP8. I was surprised since I missed the signup for it. I had commented in the signup for PP7 that I was sorry I had missed that. Will casually commented \"maybe next time\". Abosolutely nice dude. Seriously.\n\nOkay, so...I fucked up. Big time. The first thing I noticed is that this base is softer than any other B&M soap I have. That goes back to White Label, Black Label, Glissant and Reserve. The second thing I noticed is that the brush had significant drag while trying to load. As a result, I wet the tips much more than I usually do. After that, loading was easy. Very easy. Extremely easy. So easy in fact that I overloaded...a lot. I mean I really had a fucking mess on my hands, literally. It would seem that this base takes very little product to make lather.\n\nRather than rinse off and start over, I decided to power through my mistake and make the best of it. I managed to get the lather properly hydrated which is to say it took a lot of water. The lather was dense and voluminous. I need to reasses these characteristics when I shave tomorrow with a lighter load. Now the slickness, well...lemme tell you about that. The first pass was with a layer of lather that was way thicker than I usually use due to my loading error. There was some lather left on my face after the first pass. Rather than apply lather with the brush, I simply put a little water on my hands and rubbed the left over lather around. It was plenty slick for a second pass. Now for the really crazy part. I repeated that for the third pass. No shit. It was a little bit marginal for that pass, but it was a good example of the base's residual slickness. For the fourth pass I applied the lather with the brush as I normally would and finished up.\n\nPost shave feel is a very important attribute for me because of my extremely dry skin. Some people think that simply applying moisturizer will offset any drying effect of any soap. I roll my eyes every time I hear/read this. These folks are obviously fortunate not to have the dry skin that I do. Post shave properties of soap matters...a lot. This base has a very good post shave feel. It is at least on a par with Reserve if not a touch better.\n\nAll of these impressions need to be taken with a grain of salt since I have used the base exactly one time. And my impressions may alter a bit with successive uses. I'll see over the next few days.",

I've only had a few brushes in my time, a super cheap \"badger\" I got from Amazon forever ago and then synthetics. I know in my head that brushes are yet another area where YMMV and personal preference come into play, but dammit this thing was perfect already. I soaked it a bit yesterday and ran it through a test lather but today was the first time on my face. I honestly can't brag about this enough. I decided to bust out the SW set this mornin to fully round out the experience and that was such a wonderful idea. I'm debating on taking a break again from the straight though. I just don't feel up to trying so hard on my shave and only getting irritation in return. I dunno. I'll just see how I feel next weekend and go from there. Happy Sunday y'all!",

Obviously they are at different price points, and meant for different things. But it's fun to switch back an forth to really notice what you like and don't like.\n\nThough lather was too airy, I had another great shave with above avg results, and a really nice shave in some tough spots for me.\n\n**Razor and Blade Notes** - *Wolfman - WR1 SB .67 Polished with Gillette - Nacet (45)*\nBlade is chugging along, happy to give me great shaves. No irritation, and even the balm at the end of the shave that had alcohol in it testified to that!\n\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n\n**Soap Notes** - *Le Pere Lucien - Cologne Fougere*\nEven with less soap, the lather was too airy.\n\nNext time: maybe try marco method.\n\nScent was very nice. Masculine, clean, fresh, grassy. Great morning scent, or spring or summer.\n\nPaired well with my Cella balm IMO.\n\n\n**Brush Notes** - *Golden Nib - Silvertip Premium 22mm*\nThis brush seems to have a little more backbone than my Whipped Dogs. I like it so far, light and luxurious. I hope tips will soften a little with more use.\n\n----\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger**\n\nUse this to document how long our blades last, if you want, and what about them made us pitch 'em.

This was the last of a small sample I was given, which I am happy to finish as I already have a full sized set of it. It has a very pleasant smell. It is a somewhat difficult smell to fully explain. To me, it has a somewhat soft opening from the bergamot and sandalwood, and then it gets a little powdery and musky at the finish. It lends its self to a great smell.\n\nNow to performance, Declaration Grooming's bison tallow soap base is awesome. It produces an amazing lather, with superior slickness, and leaves the face feeling great after the shave. I had a great shave with it today, and I followed that up with the matching aftershave. The first time I used it, I didn't realize that the aftershave had some menthol in it, so that took be by surprise, but it was a nice surprise. I really like the touch of menthol without it being too much. I also used the matching Eau de Parfum, which is a great compliment to soap, and obviously has a much longer lasting scent.\n\nI hope everyone has a relaxing Sunday.",

They are noticeably wider than a typical DE blade and I definitely felt it more in this shave. It was tolerable on my face--not so much on my neck. Even making an effort to work as gingerly as possible, I ended up with a lot of visible irritation on my neck (confirmed with a generous application of the alum block). I'll swap this blade out into my adjustable razor (where I can compensate a little better) for its remaining lifespan. On the plus side, I really liked the scent on the Dr. Jon Classic soap and splash. To my unsophisticated nose, the soap scent is almost a dead ringer for B&M Seville--very citrus forward. The vegan base sacrifices some slickness vs. tallow soaps, but not too much. The splash is also very citrus-forward on application (lime & bergamot), but the dry down surfaces a bit of lavender and finally a prominent cedar, which I really enjoyed. This was the first AS sample I've used that came in a spray bottle, and it works so well that I wonder why more vendors don't go this route. Seems to make for a more efficient application (and use less product) than splashing it on my hands first.",

I couldn't honestly say that one was better than the other...they were just...different. Neither was new, though, so on my next shave, I think I'll do it with brand new blades for each.\n\nShaken and Taum Sauk is still a fantastic combo. Thanks for that recommendation /u/shredsofmetal (at least I *think* that was you).",

We're going to be cooking his favorite thing, tri-tip steak, and having some beer and whiskey. The razor is his birth year and quarter. No, the razor wasn't his as he always had a beard and just used clippers to clean up. I wish I didn't have to work tomorrow because I just want to get good and drunk and have a day to recover because I'm not in my twenties. At least I smell good.\n\nOn another note, the wife and child and I went to the Riverside Food Lab last night and had some great food. There's an Augie's Coffee House in there so I picked up a bag of their Ethiopian coffee. I had some this morning and it was delicious. I've never had coffee taste like that. So good!",

Their veggie base is one of my favorite soap bases, so I was excited to try this new base. It lathers voluminously, doesn't seem to *need* a ton of water but can take a lot without breaking down. It performs very well and has a nice post shave feel. Only area where I'd fault it is residual slickness. I was still able to do tons of buffing, but it didn't have that feels-like-you-don't-even-need-to-relather feeling. That might be fixed in future shaves when I'm not trying to see just how much water I can get it to take. The ingredients list includes a few interesting things, like honey and aloe.\n\nThe Uplift scent is an invigorating, bright citrus, heavy on lemongrass I believe.",

I bought this sample awhile ago and unintentionally stacked a few on top of each other before separating them out. I did get a bit of the Drakkar scent however I recently tried a sample of Mickey Lee's Pantie Dropper which has a stronger scent. That aside, I had no issues with the lather itself.\n\nI also used a straight razor for he first time ever. I picked up a Tuckmar-Extra 9/16 FH RP from Sam in the Bazaar. It seemed so small at first and it dawned on me that although I'd seen them in SOTD, in YouTube videos and online I never held one in person before. It seemed intimidating at first but I'm glad to report that my face is still in tact with no cuts or weepers. I was able to do two passes, WTG and XTG. I mostly did my cheeks and neck and left the Gillette Slim for my chin, below the nose and clean up. I'll probably stick to this until I develop a better technique.",

As such, I will be shaving with Diamond until my Rockies either win the World Series or are eliminated from play. I will be changing up other aspects of the shave but the Diamond will be the daily. The Diamond will propel the Rockies to glory and victory.\n\nBaseball was my first love. It's the only thing I love as much as I do now as I did when I was like eight years old. I played Little League and some Coach Pitch when I was a kid but realized quickly that I was far more musically inclined than I was physically inclined and so I resigned myself to enjoy baseball from the stands and I am content with that.\n\nFootball is a blast to watch but I don't get emotional about the Broncos. If they win? Great. If they lose? That's okay. But I do get emotional about baseball. I was late to work because I had to sit and watch Ubaldo Jimenez no-hit the Braves in 2010 and I shed tears on the drive in. I was lucky enough to score tickets to Todd Helton's last home game and when he clubbed [this shot]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gX1Is43Arjw), I sat in the stands and cried like a bitch. I don't care if Jake Peavy hung that one on purpose. It was the last time I'd ever see Todd round the bases. And the Rockies got killed by the Sox that night. I hated them for what happened in '07 and I hated them for that night too.\n\n*\"You can't sit on a lead and run a few plays into the line and just kill the clock. You've got to throw the goddamn ball over the plate and give the other man his chance. That's why baseball is the greatest game of them all.\"* - Earl Weaver\n\nAnd but I feel like I owe a lot to the game itself. When I was in my early 20's, my parents split for awhile and it came as a total shock to me and my siblings. My mom moved out and got a little apartment for herself and I moved in with my dad to help out around the house and with yardwork, etc. Our relationship was strained and things between him and I were tense and awkward at times. But that summer, baseball helped keep our relationship afloat. Regardless of everything else going on, we could always find common ground over baseball. It's important to me for that. My parents have since gotten back together and things are just fine. But baseball was there for me and my father when I felt like we really needed it.\n\nAnd not only that but I do believe that baseball is a metaphor for life in a way that other sports are not. Because, like life, there is no clock. No timeouts. I could go on and on about this reason in particular but I'll leave it to Joe Posnanski to [explain it better than I could.]( http://joeposnanski.com/baseball-night-in-america/) He wrote that after the last day of the 2011 season, which was a night like no other. There probably won't be another night like that in decades.\n\n*\"Of course, there are those who learn after the first few times. They grow out of sports. And there are others who were born with the wisdom to know that nothing lasts. These are the truly tough among us, the ones who can live without illusion, or without even the hope of illusion. I am not that grown-up or up-to-date. I am a simpler creature, tied to more primitive patterns and cycles. I need to think something lasts forever, and it might as well be that state of being that is a game; it might as well be that, in a green field, in the sun.\"* - Bart Giamatti\n\n[Here is a link]( https://mason.gmu.edu/~rmatz/giamatti.html) to the full piece that previous quote comes from. Bart was MLB commissioner for only the '89 season. Fun fact: actor Paul Giamatti is his son. He, reportedly, is not a big baseball fan or sports fan in general. For shame, Paul. For shame.\n\nBut anyways. I didn't come here to tell you all that.\n\nThe Rockies are in first place by .5 games with 13 games to go. We won yesterday after humiliating back-to-back shutouts from the Giants. The fucking Giants. I hate that team and everything they stand for. I hate that team more than I hated our High School rivals. I hate that team more than I hate the Raiders and *every* good Colorado sports fan hates the Raiders. I hate the Giants with the white-hot intensity of a thousand burning suns. But we are done with them for this season. The Dodgers remain the greatest threat and it's who we play over the next three days. This series will have the air of playoff baseball. This series will make the Rockies prove that they can for-realz hang with LAD. I honestly feel like if the Rockies don't take at least 2 out of 3, it may be the death knell for this team.\n\nHence the Diamond soap. I can't just stand by and do nothing.",

It's not bad enough that I won't finish out the sample, but I probably wouldn't risk buying a full tub. The scent is mid-strong and is very much patchouli forward.

I had been using a Karve w/E plate exclusively, but decided to try something different. The new Timeless gave a good, close shave. Generally happy with it this far. Biggest complaints are that it's hard to keep clean with the shiny finish, and the dimpled handle is a little difficult to hold on to.\n\n\nRegarding the song, it's well suited for many reasons, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\n1) general sexiness\n\n2) sing-a-long-ability, specifically using a razor as a pretend microphone\n\n3) music video perfection\n\n4) I dare you to find a more well suited song\n\nOff to smoke two pork shoulders, as the weather in New England is beginning to wither to Autumn temperatures and my smoking season is coming to an end.\n\nHave a great day, everyone.\n\n\nEdit 1: [**It begins. 7:54AM.**](https://imgur.com/a/k63lKvP)\n\n\nEdit 2: [**It continues. 10:37AM.**](https://i.imgur.com/EFuuXO3.gif)\n\n\nEdit 3: [**It continues to continue. 2:07PM**](https://imgur.com/a/YPZbTKZ)\n",

No clue. I still love it, even if I can't describe it. I accidentally went a bit heavy on the EdT this mornin...fingers crossed nobody comes into the clinic with an upset stomach today!

Greaves & Sons 6/8 NW\n**Post:** Lucky Tiger - Oil of Olay Complete\n\nMy second go with PP8 and it went better than my first. I was mindful not to overload it. It really liked the boar, I mean it liked it a lot. Damn good to know that. Not all bases work this well with a boar for me. This one works as well as any artisanal base I have ever used with a boar. I have made no secret of my affinity for boar brushes. Having a base that works well across the spectrum of brush types is a big plus.\n\nThe shave went very well and I experienced the same slickness that I did yesterday, but I skipped the technique of just rubbing water on my face for the second and third passes. I did water the living shit out of the lather though. This base holds a metric fuck ton of water. It is a very thirst base. To those who are testing this, don't be stingy with the water. Thank me later.\n\nAnother word about the post shave feel. I know this attribute is meaningless to many, but I am not speaking to you so you can stop reading now. For those that suffer from extremely dry skin, this base offers a very good post shave feel and is very beneficial for post shave comfort. I still used a moisturizer since it's part of my everyday routine, but this base leaves behind a really nice feel that is better than a most of the other soaps in my collection. It will be interesting to see what direction this base takes.",

I love that Mousse de Saxe smell in the base, and the rest more or less gets muddled to my nose. In the splash, it follows up kind of the same but before too long that dry dry down kicks in. Mmmmm that lovely, sweet, vanilla-y dry down, mixing with the Mousse de Saxe. Divine. I have a soft (hard?) spot for vanilla and I'm not sure I've come across a vanilla fragrance yet that I didn't like.

And that, my friends, means we start with [this lovely little guy.](https://imgur.com/gallery/UIbOHx5) According to Itchy, [there's nowhere to go but up from here,](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/8qqqre/comment/e0ml3aw?st=JM5TLHX9&sh=c27f71cd) so here we go.\n\nThis soap fucking stinks. Like, really fucking stinks. Dry, it smelled...odd. Chemical, slightly sanitary, with an artificial sweetness. Once I begun to lather though, ohdeargodinheavenwhyhavethouforsakenme, it was bad. A humid indoor collection of mostly full Honey Buckets is what my bathroom smells like now, and probably will for the near future. My wife will not be happy when she wakes up. This was definitely not a \"passable\" soap like Arko or Tabac or Williams that some around like to use, this was trash. Oh it lathered alright, but that provided no protection, very little slickness, and oh sweet Jesus, that miserable scent.\n\nI feel dirty. I feel unclean.",

Lilac is probably my favorite scent and it brings back memories of my childhood spent at my Granny's house. She had 3 huge lilac bushes that she was very proud of, and this scent takes me back to those east TN summer days. If you like floral scents, this is a must have.\n\nThis is my first use of a Derby since my first ever DE shave. I have to say, they gave me a completely un-remarkable shave. And that's not a bad thing.\n\nHappy Monday :(",

The blade is held firmly in place, the shave angle, though different from the DE norm, suggests itself readily, and the Pushbutton shaves like a dream, minimal blade feel and maximal efficiency. No two pass BBS miracles, but three pass BBS is easy, and lasts a long time once achieved. No weepers or irritation, just a very clean and comfy shave.\n* The appeal of looking down at that nasty looking GEM blade and thinking \"holy shit, I'm shaving with a box cutter!\" is pure entertainment, and the end result is among the finest shaves I have gotten from DE or SE razors. Significant wow factor, and for a razor that cost me all of $15 on the Bay. I wish the handle were a tad longer, but all is good in the end.\n\n* Blade: Only real flaw in GEM Heaven is that blade selection is very limited - Personna made carbon, SS, and PTFE coated SS are one's only mainstream options. The RWS GEM Mafia has been kind enough to send me some PTFEs which are en route, but in the meantime, I used the uncoated version for three days. Really no issues. Smooth enough, no blood or pain, a lot nicer shave than from many coated DE blades. There's about a 25% price difference between coated and uncoated when bought in bulk, so I will carefully weigh the performance between the blades when I have the PTFEs in hand.\n\n* Soap: Wholly Kaw \"new vegan\" impressed me again - a very tallow like shave quite close to the DM tallow base in performance, and the scent here is one of my favorites in the WK lineup.\n\n* SEptember Analysis: GEM blades completely mop the floor with injectors, having none of that blade's liabilities - no mystery weepers, or short lived shaves at least when comparing the two razors I have used with each blade. The GEM feels sharp and stable with not a hint of chatter and feels rather like a retro AC blade. If you have not yet tried a GEM, sink $15 or so into the experience - it has a unique feel and gave an awesome shave, even with my relatively unloved Pushbutton.",

For Wildcard Week, I decided to make it almost like a mini-month, starting with spring and summer scents, then ending with fall and early winter to lead into next week. Jacinthe was a spring offering from Barrister and Mann. It has a nice pleasant smell, with a lemon and hyacinth front, mellowing out with pear and tomato leaf to take off the sweetness. Hyacinth's are some of my favorite spring flowers, so this soap was definitely up my alley. I followed the shave up with the matching aftershave, and to me, the aftershave smells much more strongly of lemon. In fact, it kind of smells just like lemon pez. Very enjoyable, but quite sweet.\n\nThe performance was great as this is an offering in the glissant base. Easy enough to lather with good protection. Had an easy shave today. The aftershave was a good followup and left my skin feeling great.\n\nHope everyone has a good start to the work week.",

Maybe my past experience with LPL was with the Tallow and it was just easier to lather well. At least this time, I made a lather that was enjoyable. I just had to whip it for 9 mins or so. Gotta reduce that!\n\n**Razor and Blade Notes** - *Wolfman - WR1 SB .67 Polished with Gillette - Nacet (46)*\nGreat as usual. Comfortable and cut well.\n\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Very Close Shave\n*Neck*: Few hairs are showing some tip length (with most being cut flush)\n\n**Soap Notes** - *Le Pere Lucien - Cologne Fougere*\nlather still too airy, but this time slickness was very present and gave a good feeling shave with plenty of glide. It just wasn't creamy or dense.\n\nScent was very nice. Masculine, clean, fresh, grassy. Great morning scent, or spring or summer.\n\nPaired well with my Cella balm IMO, and it didn't conflict with Clubman Whiskey Woods just now.\n\nNext time, try a wet brush, just maybe a *medium* amount of water... and halve the soap.\n\n**Brush Notes** - *Golden Nib - Silvertip Premium 22mm*\nBrush is super soft and very nice right now. This is due to 24 hr MWF lather (for the lanolin) soak. Made a noticeable difference.\n\nPretty much a perfect brush for me. A little more backbone than a Whipped Dog, but light touch with super soft tips.\n\n----\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger**\n\nUse this to document how long our blades last, if you want, and what about them made us pitch 'em. I created a Google Form with just a few questions:\n\n[Ending of Blades Ledger](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform)\n\n[The Ledger Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing) in case you want to just look at the data.\n\nI'll keep this as my footer each SOTD so you have the link. I'll take it down if no one shows interest.\n",

Though aggressive the razor delivered an easy, irritation free shave. This was the third shave on this Personna Blue that I picked up in Winnipeg. The last shave with it in my QShave Futur Clone was a little rough. Personna Blues are almost always a good performer for me; the QShave must not like them. My Semogue 830 whipped LASSC's Black Fern beautifully. IMO this smells nearly identical even better than Martin de Candre's Fougere and the black soap is pretty cool. Might need to dial in my lather as I was getting some dissipation towards the end. Also might have been experiencing a burny reaction to the soap. I had that problem with Topanga Fougere as well thinking it was the tolu basalm but Blackfern doesn't have any tolu. More testing is needed. Them alum stick burned like hell fire but my lady friend complimented my Lucky Tiger Aspen. Go get Monday ladies and gents!",

I've seen people raving over the Sweet Lemon scent so I was excited to try it. One of my all time favorite soaps is 42 from B&M and I was hoping that this would be something similar, it's not, but that doesn't mean that I dislike this scent, I just don't love it as much as I love 42. It is a lot more approachable than 42 and the scent is a much more subtle sweetness versus the candied sweetness of 42. This is my first time trying Summer Storm from CFG and I like it a lot, the aftershave helped tone my face post-shave and had a nice clean scent that I really liked.",

I can get 3 good passes on my cheeks. Saved my neck and chin some irritation and used the Karve on them till I get a little better at this. Its a spike tip and I seem to catch myself with this on occasion or it gets stuck a little in my cheek. I have a pretty angular face. Also its only 4/8 I think and although that seems like it should be more easily controlled I feel like something a little thicker would be easier. Is a round or spanish tip and thicker 5/8-6/8 blade generally a little easier to master?\n\n",

However, I found the lather to be somewhat wanting. It's a very soft soap. I smashed a typical amount of it into my bowl, and rung out my synthetic brush pretty well, yet within the first 10 seconds of swirling I had obliterated any trace of the sample with only a light froth to show for it. Discouraged, I kept at it a bit longer, then finally gave in and added another scoop of soap into the bowl. I ultimately got something to work with (see SOTD pic) but it fell into the category of a \"low structure\" lather--the kind that will fling all over the bathroom if you like to paint aggressively with your brush. I don't think there were any issues with the razor or blade, but my shave was not as efficient today...ultimately took 4 passes to get a satisfactory result, and still had some irritation on my neck (probably residual from yesterday). Fortunately, the CL splash works wonders to calm my skin down. Better luck tomorrow, hopefully.",

It's a great fougere scent and is sort of a poor man's version of MdC. The updated base is vastly improved over the original and creates a much richer and slicker lather without the foaminess of the original. It's not quite elite level but it's very good and definitely justifies a purchase if you like the scents.",

I believe it's vegan (or at least non-tallow), but it shaves like a tallow-based soap. The scent is mid strength and is purported to \"remind one of a Victorian wood-paneled library full of leather bound Jules Verne's and H.G. Wells novels.\"\n\nMy wife says that it smells like play dough to her, but I can definitely see how this would recreate a steampunk library vibe for some people. It's something of a unicorn in that it's a scent that manages to be fairly neutral/work friendly, yet is still unlike anything else I've come across.\n\nIf you happen to find a sample, I'd highly recommend giving this one a try. Given the price point ($30+ per tub), I probably won't be getting this anytime soon. If it goes on sale though...\n\nEDIT: A word",

      "body": "**Sample September** - [Sept 18th SOTD](https://imgur.com/a/PsBOwc9)\n\nSoap: Declaration Grooming Sweet Lemon\n\nBrush: Stirling Soap Co Finest Badger - 24mm Fan Knot (Butterscotch)\n\nRazor: Maggard MR18 with V3 head with Personna blade\n\nPost: Alum block/ cold water\n\nFor the 18th day of Sample September, I went with Declaration Grooming's Sweet Lemon. This was a somewhat recent offering in the Icarus base, along with Shore and Contemplation. Sweet lemon is most definitely a sweet smell. I honestly get lemongrass and coconut. With that said, I still do enjoy it, but it wasn't necessarily the lemon forward scent I thought it might be. Shore was definitely my favorite, but I would say this is tied with Contemplation right behind shore.\n\nThe performance is awesome. It takes a lot of water to get it going, but once it's going, it doesn't stop. Tons of lather produced with great density and slickness. Definitely some of the best performance out of a soap I have used. Didn't even feel the need for an aftershave today.\n\nHave a great Tuesday everyone!",

No noticeable machining marks. Weight feels like, similar to my Timeless, might pull the scale out when i get home to see how they compare.\n\nLather was nice.

I am comfortable in stating that this base works well with any brush type. Also, it takes so very little product to shave with. As a point of comparison, I have to use about 5x the amount of the original HeV formula as I do PP8. I can also use exponentially more water with PP8 too. I haven't decided which badger I'm going to use tomorrow, but I don't think it will matter much. This base will perform good regardless.",

One \"tactical\" issue: to get BBS below the nose, I need to make a fools pass (ATG upwards) on the upper lip, and the GEM / Pushbutton combo does not seem to like that concept. Feels scrapey, seems to be a lot of noise with minimal cutting (is this chatter?) and I can't get the area to be quite as clean as is possible with many DE combos.\n\n* Brush: the stone handle is really cool. Ages well, adds heft, very unique and attractive. I wish more brush makers would make stone handles - all the swirley resin handles kind of blur into the same product over time to me.\n\n* Frag: Enh, don't know what to make of this. Tsar by VC&A is one of my faves, and PH has been around just as long and many love it. But to me, I get a sharp unpleasant citrus blast followed by a generic soapy smell with eventual dead flower notes in the drydown. I feel I am missing something here. The scent lasts a looong time though, so today will be a bit of a slog, as I am already tired of how I smell at 9:30 AM ...",

This baby is a swirl of blue and white, to pay homage to my pursuit of my M.S. degree. It also comes with a PSU logo coin on the bottom for added \"WE ARE\" awesomeness. Absolutely not enough can be said about the b6 knot, just a superb knot.\n\nPP8 is the other newcomer into my house, thanks to Will. This soap is absolutely superb, generates a beautiful and dense lather. Slickness is fantastic and insanely easy to use. For me it is a very soft soap, which I really enjoy but I do not believe this is the artists full intention for production.\n\nHappy Tuesday!",

Coconut oil is *very* [comedogenic,](https://www.beneficialbotanicals.com/comedogenic-rating/) and not something you should be putting on your face, no matter what your favorite skin care blogger says.\n\nThis was not a good shave. I wasn't actively suppressing my gag reflex like the Dragons Bloody Stool, the scent here was actually quite nice. I think I might even keep this aftershave. The soap, however, is going to be spending eternity 20,000 leagues under the sea in Davy Jones' locked before hopefully being swallowed whole by Moby Dick, who is then violently devoured by a Kaiju.\n",

But I don't use it that much. Which leads me to a few theories:\n\n1) this is a soap I scoop often for sampling\n\n2) I sleep walk and instead of making a 36 egg omlete on the kitchen floor, I practice lather making\n\n3) somewhere in a similar but parallel dimension there's another me trying to figure out how the tub is getting *fuller* as it dissappears from my tub into that one. Jet Li in *[The One](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_One_(2001_film))* style.\n\n4) one of you shady sumbitches is sneaking in through a skylight at night, bypassing the overlapping and redundant security systems, befriending my dog before gaining entrance to my bathroom to use up all my CeE soap before sneaking out again.\n\n\n\n[Occam's Razor](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam's_razor) states that all things being equal, the simplest explanation is probably the correct one.\n\n[So, if I catch you in my bathroom, whoever you are, we're gonna fight.](https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/12415063/Family_Guy_Aggressive.0.gif)\n",

Something about it didn't stick with me right. Sort of reminded me of the cologne my uncle wears but was just a bit off. I like it enough to use up the sample but will be eager to try anoher afterwards.\n\nI picked up the shave mug on the bazaar and it came in Sunday. It's in fantastic shape and is quite enjoyable to use and lather up in. I don't find that it lathers any better with the old spice mug but I enjoy using it more than my previous bowl so it will be my new go to for lathering when I don't want to face lather.",

I get mostly rose and black tea out of the container, and a bit more of a woody base once lathered. It blends nicely together, and performs in the upper tier of artisan soaps I've tried.

The Polsilver performed so smooth on its first shave, I'm sticking with it for good! This is the third RazoRock product I have used, and I thought it would be hard to lather since I forgot to bloom it while taking a shower like I have with my previous outings. But it proved me wrong in a big way. Didn't even have to lather it like I hate it lol. In less than a minute I had that brush more than loaded enough for my normal two passes, and in the first time since I don't know when, I did NOT have to do a clean-up pass on my neck.\nThe scent was clean and citrusy, and the soap was a nice slick layer of protection. The splash scent was a bit stronger than I was expecting, but still very nice.",

I did a very light load today. Lighter than any of the previous shaves. It was perhaps a little too light, but I still managed a comfortable four pass shave. It is so easy to overload this base that I wanted to make certain that I didn't do that. This base kinda reminds me of Reserve in the sense that it takes very little product to shave with. I wonder if that is why some people have trouble with Reserve. They overload it without realizing it. Anyway, in spite of the uber\nlight load today, there is enough innate slickness to use a very thin layer and still have enough protection. Tomorrow I will use a badger and then finish out the testing on Friday back with the same synthetic I started with.",

PP8 and bison have a lot in common as they both are insanely easy to use, make great dense lathers, and ultimately perform at the top tier.

While v1 was already a very good performer, v2 offers a marked improvement lather density, protection and the ability to take more water, which in turn increases the slickness as well. Post shave is about on par with v1 if not a bit better as well. Keep in mind I have no idea what the ingredient differences are between the 2 bases. I didn't want to taint my impressions with extra info. I would say if you're on the fence about picking up an SW soap, wait for the new release, choose a scent that interests you and go for it. I doubt you'll be disappointed as this brand offers excellent value for the money.",

The uncoated blade is still comfy, and seems to be cutting fine. The ATG fools pass on upper lip remains a problem, but I can get BBS there without too much discomfort.\n\n* It amuses me that this razor is considered \"very mild\" by GEM cognoscenti. I get a 9 hour BBS from it, something I usually can get only with fairly aggressive DEs with sharp blades.\n\n* Soap: Love the scent, vetiver and rose. Performance continues to be mixed - by the end of a three pass shave, my face is swept clean of stubble, but hurts like the dickens, a much different feel than the pain free conclusions I get from Eufros, WK, and Reserve (though pretty similar to the state Glissant leaves me in.)\n\n* I yearn for a post shave like men lost in the desert yearn for water. I do the cold water splash, apply the post shave, 10 seconds of \"Home Alone\" trauma... and then a blissful calm soothed feeling that lasts the rest of the day.\n\n* Is this a \"bad shave\"? I dunno. No blood, the stubble is very much gone, no irritation or lasting pain. Those last few minutes of the third pass and immediately after feel awful at the time, but the pain goes away and stays gone with pretty minimal effort.\n\n* I continue to prefer the blissful aftermath of my top tier soaps, but I keep using CB because I like the brand, love the scents, and find the achey post shave easily remedied.\n\n* Brush: The unassuming Paladin continues to be the most synth like badger I own - no real break in period, easy to load, efficient lather pass through, and excellent face feel and softness balance. Worth the price I guess, though it takes some use and comparison to appreciate.",

I went with a sample of History 101 and can I just say that these folks know how to do samples. I like the larger sample size. I use Picture Day fairly often so I'm familiar with the base but haven't gotten around to trying the History 101. This is right up my alley. Some tobacco, leather, a little smokiness. It hit all of the right notes for me. These soaps lather up so easily and I had so much lather I actually brushed a little off my face, which I don't think I've ever done before. I probably had enough for five passes but only went with three. A great shave, great scent, great post-shave. So I totally won't hold the lopsided fantasy football defeat against him. The Fine American Blend does pair pretty well with this even if it does dry my face out a little.\n\n[history 101](https://imgur.com/gallery/WL1enoF)",

And all with a 48-use blade to boot.\n\n**Razor and Blade Notes** - *Timeless .68 with Gillette - Nacet (48)*\nBefore the Wolfman .67, I was using a Dart... so that's some aggressive shavers for quite some time now. But for fun, I switched back to my milder Timeless and really enjoyed the comfortable, smooth shave. Resutls were a bit less than what either of the other two gives me, but not by enough to matter today.\n\n**Soap Notes** - *SBS - Shaken*\n1 tsp soap + 3 tsp water gave me a slick, luxurious, creamy lather. Maybe do 3.5 next time if I want to have a more hydrated one. Easy lather to work up, as well.\n\nScent was very nice cologne type, but strength was at about 2-3/10, so I wished for a bit more in that dept. When I did get a good waft of it, I can see why people were clamoring for it when it was released a while back.\n\n**Shave Quality**\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Smooth\n*Neck*: Smooth\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Few hairs are showing some tip length (with most being cut flush)\n\n----\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger**\n\nUse this to document how long our blades last, if you want, and what about them made us pitch 'em. I created a Google Form with just a few questions:\n\n[Ending of Blades Ledger](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform)\n\n[The Ledger Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing) in case you want to just look at the data.\n\nI'll keep this as my footer each SOTD so you have the link. I'll take it down if no one shows interest.\n",

Very impressive performance! As I mentioned to /u/assistantpigkeeper, my initial impression of the scent was that it was perhaps too feminine for me, but after lathering it and using it, I have warmed up to it. It has bit of a citrus opening and a sharp, almost fougere-like character. But the violet and lavender (and other florals) are still the main thing, so not for those who don't like florals. Nice stuff, /u/ntownuser! I've got a tub of Coeur de Vert on the way now, too.\n\nThe Streamline... My god... May well be the best shaving razor I've ever used. Certainly in the top three.\n",

The trail has a great scent. It reminds me of taking a walk in the woods, smelling all of the trees and nature in general. In the front of the sent I get a lot of pine, but that then mellows out to include other tree scents and oak moss. It's an awesome forest/ woodsy scent and I would def recommend it to anybody. To compare, it reminds me of Boreal by T+S and of Ozark mountain by Stirling.\n\nFor performance, Noble Otter's soap base is great. I have never tried the original soap base, but this one performs very well in every aspect. Got a great lather from this soap today, and had a very smooth shave. Didn't even feel the need aftershave.\n\nHope everyone had a good middle to their work week.",

I dig the sweet almond scent (maybe not everyday, but enough to have in a rotation). However, I was not overwhelmed by the performance. The first bunch of lather I worked up was too foamy, so I flicked it into the sink and kept working the brush. After about 90 seconds I got something I could work with....it was perfectly adequate, just not something I would rush out to buy (unlike some other standout performers I've sampled this month). The Str8 shave splash I picked up during the Groomatorium moving sale, without any idea what it smelled like. At first I was meh on it, but it's been growing on me. I think it would pair well with RazoRock MudderFocker. It also has less bite than some other alcohol-based splashes, which suited me just fine today.",

This one's very nice, kind of reminds me of seville except a bit bolder. I'll be adding a full container of this one into my den I think.",

It does have a good weight and balance to it, but slippery when wet. Had to re-teach myself to apply a little pressure to get a close shave since the Leaf has a pivoting head. Will have to see how shave II goes in the problem areas like under the nose and in the chin area.\nThe soap was a good performer. Nice thick lather and protected pretty well. I would say that the scent was very mild but fresh.",

First on the list is the Stirling Glastonbury. It's still crazy as hell that, as much as I used to DESPISE the smell of patchouli, I've honestly developed an enjoyment of it after getting into wet shaving. It's not a scent that's relegated to unwashed hippies after all! I don't have the matching aftershave, so I decided to channel my inner dad and go with Brut. This was my dad's signature scent my entire life. If my mom found a different deodorant or whatnot on sale and bought it, he'd use it but go right the hell back to Brut afterward. It somehow paired right the hell with the Glastonbury rather nicely. But, I'm getting WAY too damn sentimental this mornin, so I decided to try to drown out the scent with the FG. Yeah. Real smart idea here. Ya know, this just is the scent of working out in the garden with my dad. Ugh. I miss the grouchy old fucker haha. If your parents are still around, at least shoot em a text or make a call while you have the chance. Anyway, happy Friday Eve y'all!",

Over all though a nice shave.\n\nWhile the knurling looks like holding this razor would be awkward it's really not.

Honestly they haven't changed much after the first use but I felt it was only fair to make sure that was the case. In short: its a stabilized reserve. Its like if Glissant and Reserve base had a baby. Its dense but does not goo. This base to me takes all of the qualities that people love about the Glissant base (i.e. ease of use and quick to lather) and combines them with the best qualities of the Reserve base (i.e. dense protective lather, slickness, post shave). Honestly, this base is incredible. It very well could be my favorite base yet. Its slick as all hell, for sure the slickest soap I've used yet. It dials in so incredibly easy and rewards you with a beautiful dense lather that looks like greek yogurt. I would say reserve may be a touch denser, but in use you will notice no difference. Synthetic or badger, this soap knows no difference. It lathers easily and quickly regardless of the hair type. I know Will said he is going to firm up the base on the next run but I hope he doesn't. With how soft it is it loads so fast and easy its quite convenient. I am very curious as to what he plans to do with this base, is it a reserve replacement? A glissant replacement? We will just have to wait and see I guess... One thing is for sure, I am definitely going to need some of this in the Seville scent.\n\nThursday is almost Friday. I can't wait for the weekend...",

Thank you Will, for mentioning this a while ago.\n\nBBS-1 did its usual thing. Flawless. Great Thursday shaves to all.",

Fifth different type brush. This base has worked very well regardless of what brush I have used with it. Summing up my experience with this base, I would have to say that it is a very good base. It takes very little product and holds quite a bit of water which makes for a pretty slick lather. Since I tend to use less product and more water than most people, a tub of this base would likely last me for well over half a year of daily shaves. The post shave feel is quite good. It is one of the best I have experienced. The only criticism I have is that this base is a tad too soft. Will has already commented that this will be corrected in future versions.",

I missed yesterday. I slept in, and didn't even shave. I'm not terribly upset, I wasn't planning on shaving for 30 days uninterrupted, I AM human, and am not interested in turning this hobby into [ritual self-mutilation](https://imgur.com/gallery/BuUN5U8) or anything. But I felt like I should make up for the unplanned break with something special. Something that, [according to my friend Itchy,](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/8v8kdn/comment/e1mu4it?st=JMA12344&sh=7cafb5ee) to whom I'm *ever* so grateful for all these soaps, is not a good thing to shave with.\n\nHonestly, off the tub, I don't mind this scent. I catch mostly citrus, namely tangerine and orange. It's got a warmer, musky-ish scent filling out the background? Like vanilla almost. I can't detect any resemblance of hops despite there being three different varieties hidden in here. So, like the stupid white guy in all those scary movies, I went ahead. I shaved with it. Actually got halfway through the first pass before the citrus started wearing off, [and the true nature of the scent](https://imgur.com/gallery/eAnruAN) started making itself known. And it was bad. Like a snowball, or a house of cards, this only got worse once it started. It turned...skunky, is the best word for it. But not in good, \"you're gonna get high as fuck and relax all evening\" kind of skunky. Like, a warmer-than-room-temperature Stella thats been sitting in the sun all day kind of skunky. Finishing two passes and cleaning up was a bit of struggle. And then, I applied the splash. I was in a rush, I was hurrying, I wanted to get it on before I had the chance to smell it. And I fucking paid the price for that one. Dear GOD. The splash is fucking disgusting. THIS is where I get angry. THIS is where I realize why everyone hates this scent so much. Sour, rotten, skunky, acrid bullshit is what the splash smells like. This stuff is fucking GROSS. God help the poor soul who gets this soap when I finally PIF it. No mortal man deserves this kind of punishment. Not one. I washed my face, AGAIN, applied a different scent, and am keeping my fingers crossed the rest of the day that none of my coworkers can smell this stuff on me. It might get me fired.",

This week has been in the 90's and the weekend into next week is forecasted to be in the 70's and high 60's. For theme Thursday I went with my least favorite sample I have and my favorite aftershave. IMO Tallow and Steel smells like Play-doh. This soap sample gives me a weird nostalgia feel of playing with play-doh as a kid. Although the nostalgia is nice, the smell slightly bothers me. For my favorite, I paired the soap with B&M 42 splash. My favorite splash was a good way to end my \"summer\" style shaves.\n\nLet me know if any of you think T&S Himalaya smells like play-doh to you. Cheers!",

YRP is incredible, there's really no other way to put it. I'm getting better, but still struggling to make great lathers with this brush. It's so much bigger and different than anything I've ever used previously and I either under-load, or load enough for 6 passes and can't get it right. Anyone else have that problem with a brush like this?",

It's mentioned in one of the James Bond novels and the shave products were placed in a scene from Skyfall. It's a classic (read somewhat stuffy + British) blackcurrant forward scent. The scent is initially mid-strong but seems to strengthen when lathered.\n\nAs with other GFT soaps, I find that the soap lathers and protects well. I'd say the slickness and protection are at least comparable to any top-tier vegan base (albeit at a higher price tag). All in all, it's probably not something that I'd buy, but it does give a pleasant enough shave.",

      "body": "SOTD Thursday 9/20\n\nSEptember pre-empted due to Thematic Compliance...\n\n* Razor: Gillette Fatboy 1960 (iconic, overrated, overpriced, never got a good shave from it. Can my favorite soap and blade change this sad history?\n\n* Blade: Polisilver (4). Perhaps my favorite blade, well broken in, Can this fusion of Cold War enemies produce a harmonious shave?)\n\n* Soap: Eufros Tierra Humeda (vegan). Love the base, love the scent!\n\n* Brush: Thater 4125, 26 mm three band bulb. (One of my biggest disappointments in brush buying - costly, historic, gorgeous, and a lather hoarder par excellence, a Raid Roach Motel for suds...)\n\n* Post: Cremo Cooling Balm (Like, close to love, reliable, but a tad dull in terms of scent.)\n\n* Frag: Bvlgari Black EDT. (What's not to love? Imagine a tire coated in vanilla and soaking in tea. Who wouldn't want to smell like that for 8 hours or so?)\n\n* The Shave:\n\n* Razor & Blade: Three pass with FB set on 5. I have usually loitered around 3 to 4 in the past, but figured I would crank things up a bit. Poor idea! Harsh, lots of blade feel. First pass was comfy enough but had minimal stubble reduction, so I overshaved a bit on later passes to compensate. After three passes, my face felt fair to middling, but there were many remaining patches of light stubble on cheeks and neck (lips and chin at least were clean) that could be felt with a light ATG rub. Very definition of a DFS - but with any other razor I own I would have a long lasting BBS at the end of three passes with a Poli.\n\n* I guess I could in theory crank Captain America up to a higher gap and try again, but really why bother? The harshness at setting 5 combined with a mediocre shave suggests that higher settings will not be comfy, and I can get a much better shave from virtually everything else on my shelf.\n\n* Brush: Also performed to disappointing norm. 60 second load, brush looked chock full of yogurt lather. By beginning of second pass, no lather left, so reloaded, and then exact same thing with third pass, another reload needed.\n\n* I have some brushes that need a second OR third pass reload, but I think this is the only one that needs both of these. Like the forest and witch's house in Hansel and Gretel, this Teutonic marvel draws the lather in, and then locks it up in a dark dungeon at the very core of the brush.\n\n* Other than this, the Thater was charming enough in its outmoded Kent style plushness. Soft face feel, pretty minimal backbone, though certainly much better than the face mops that are Kent badgers.\n\n* A Simpson Duke is much the better brush, and cheaper. The Thater handle is nice, and the brush has never lost a hair. The instructions are also amusingly Churman, telling one the temperature range to wash the brush out and soberly warning one against the apocalyptic risks of splaying the brush when loading or lathering. (Achtung! Painting motions only, verdamnt schweinhundt!\"). All in all, if you want pillowy luxury and want to spend $125 clams on a brush --- get an Elite three band (\"High Mountain White\") instead - better backbone and more efficient flow through.\n\n* Other than the razor and the brush, everything else worked out well. Eufros, Polisilver, and Black deserve my love. Face looks nice enough, and is stubbly only to the touch - in essence a Gillette Fusion quality shave that cost more and took longer. But the theme was fun!\n\n",

I really enjoy this offering by WK. I have smelled a few products by them, and they are really hit or miss for me, but this one is definitely a star. It is just a really nice fougere, but had a somewhat crisp or bright tone to it so as to make it smell like more of a classic fragrance then of just a fougere. This combo of scents makes it really enjoyable and a go to fougere to pick up.\n\nThis sample is in WK's donkey milk base which is very, very good. The first time I used the donkey milk base, I didn't use enough water and the lather was a little thick and pasty. Now, after having done it a few times, once you get the lather dialed in properly, it makes for a great shave. The soap is super slick, and the post shave feel is incredible. I didn't feel the need for an aftershave today just because i felt so good after the shave.\n\nHave a great Thursday everyone!",

There's something in Fortitude that i just cannot stand. I enjoyed the scent off the tub but when lathered the hay comes out. It's a sweet hay that overpowers everything else. I also have trouble with this base. There's more effort required than B&M, WK, Declaration bases. I paired it with my all time favorite tobacco splash. It helped wash away that horrible hay scent.",

Often I go with a medium aggression razor so that I get a blend of comfort and cutting. But this one cuts pretty well and is crazy comfortable.\n\n**Razor and Blade Notes** - *Karve Bradley with Gillette - Nacet (49)*\nVery smooth, and worked well with the old Nacet in this mild head. This is a nice cutter for being so mild. It didn't cut my trouble spot neck hairs completely, but that could be the 49-use old blade, or the fact that I may not have found the exact angle yet.\n\n**Soap Notes** - *Dr Jon's - Anne Bonny*\nPretty nice bay rum scent. I even picked up the black tea note once.\n\nGreat performance as usual from Dr Jon's.\n\n1tsp soap + almost 5 tsp of water. This gave me maybe 2 passes of lather that I didn't use. So next time, I can reduce the soap amount.\n\n**Shave Quality**\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Smooth\n*Neck*: Smooth\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Very Close Shave\n*Neck*: Few hairs are showing some tip length (with most being cut flush)\n\n----\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger**\n\nUse this to document how long our blades last, if you want, and what about them made us pitch 'em. I created a Google Form with just a few questions:\n\n[Ending of Blades Ledger](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform)\n\n[The Ledger Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing) in case you want to just look at the data.\n\nI'll keep this as my footer each SOTD so you have the link.

I wanted to go with some steady/top/time-tested performers for soap and AS to limit variables and better assess the alum. Interesting experience. I get the feedback experience I've read others have. Not sure how much it will help/hurt but will stuck with for, say, a half-dozen more shaves in a row to judge whether this is a good addition or not.",

First off, *I'm in the fucking club now!* That's right, I got my first Declaration brush courtesy of Señor Falcons. It's a 28mm knot in a beautiful handle by Mozingo Brushworks. The handle is stunning in person, and this knot is taking me to another level. Seriously I'm glowing after the experience. It's so dense and soft, and whips up beautiful lather almost effortlessly. Brush burn is impossible with this thing. I can't really convey how big of a difference it was for me compared to anything else I've used, but the disparity is undeniable.\n\nNext I was lucky enough to snatch up this Shiva's Cognac set off Monsieur Nex. This was a small-run LE release for a French wetshaving forum. Now let me just say that Tallow + Steel is my favorite artisan, but this is my first time using the V1 base. I expected *good* as opposed to *great* because I figure the newer bases must have improved significantly. The old soap base is still amazing, and I wouldn't be surprised to hear that some people actually prefer it. The scent on this was interesting if a bit odd in the lather, but really came through beautifully in the aftershave.\n\nNo nicks, no irritation, beautiful BBS.",

It might be the most vetiver-y scent I can handle. Tbh, I wasn't sure I really enjoyed the scent at first, but I find it to be rather complex and it has grown on me. Described as a fragrance that represents the changing seasons with its citrus top and smoky, woodsy base, it feels perfect when summer is transitioning into fall. Enjoy your Friday!\n\nETA: Hey u/ntownuser, isn't VN your 2.0 base? It's quite impressive! I can't remember if your other fall offerings are 2.0, as well, or not.",

It's been forever since I've smelled Mr. Bubble's Bubble Bath as the wife gets the unscented version for the daughter, so I can't speak as to how similar the scents are. It seems like he designed the EdP and then thought a soap and aftershave would be a good idea to go along with it. JRfaT is a great scent, i just wish the soap had a little bit more depth.\n\nThe Brush was part of the Butcher Series from Dogwood Handcrafts (/u/phteven_j) who did a fantastic job on the handle. B6 is great, but seeing as this is the first use, will need to put more time on before I will render my verdict.\n\nHave a nice Friday everyone!",

For me, this was kind of a weird shave. I found the soap to be firm, but quite easy to lather. The soap was thirsty and quickly generated a dense lather with a mild aquatic/barbershop scent. The lather was stable and copious with a bright sheen. I was anticipating a really nice shave at this point.\n\nI noticed that there wasn't a ton of residual slickness between passes, but on the whole, this felt like a really top tier shave...that is until I started my ATG pass. When I applied alum at the end, there was quite a bit of feedback and even a few small red patches around my nose/mouth area. I've been shaving (literally) daily for over a year and could literally count on one hand the number of times that I've gotten irritation from my AS-D2, let alone any redness.\n\nI'm not sure what happened here as, by all indications, this was shaping up to be a great shave. I was starting on a fresh blade, so maybe the blade was off? I'll definitely give Speik another try in the future, but if I get similar results, this soap will be a hard pass for me.\n",

Fern is based off of one of the original fougere fragrances. It is nicely blended to give you a bright, green scent. I wish I had a better way to describe it, but it really is just a classic fougere with a great smell. If you like fougere fragrances, you can't go wrong with this one.\n\nFor performance, Fern is offered in B&M's reserve base. This base is really good and offers really great lather, with nice slickness and post shave feel. Definitely some of the better soap I have ever used. I finished off the shave today with the matching aftershave. The reserve aftershave is probably, in my opinion, the best aftershave out there that I have tried, and really left my face feeling great. Awesome shave today.\n\nHappy Friday everyone, we made it to the end of the week!",

THE BROWNS WON!!! THE BROWNS WON!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nAlright, now that that's out the way, this shave was incredible. Woke up early this morning, high on excitement I guess but feeling sick. Didn't shave the last couple of days so I figured I'd go for a more aggressive razor. I got such a smooth and close shave from the NEW-like Goodwill. I rarely use it because the looks don't inspire me - yeah, I'm shallow like that so what - and I have to pay some attention to it because it's capable of biting me. Anyway, I took a little bit more time this morning, paid attention, and this thing treated me right. I got absolutely no burn from the aftershave which is a rarity for me, but also not a ton of cooling from the menthol so maybe I just applied lighter than normal. The scent I haven't used in quite some time but I wanted to see if it was one I could live without or if it would stay on the never ever ever sell shelf. /u/hawns will we *ever* see this in soap form again, or was it a true one and done? The frag is also brilliant and I might just have to get the redux.\nSo happy Friday's here, I can't wait to get home after dinner out tonight and crawl into my comfy place and possibly die.",

      "body": "Friday SOTD 9/21\n\nSEptember continues, but GEMFest is pre-empted by a special guest star - needed to check a new ATT to make sure it shaves OK during my 30 day return period.\n\n* Razor: ATT Calypso Bamboo SE1\n* Blade: Feather Professional (1)\n* Soap: Tallow & Steel Boreal\n* Brush: Simpson Duke 3 Best 23mm\n* Post: Duke Cannon Ice Cold Balm\n* Frag: Azzaro Pour Homme EDT\n\n* Product Notes:\n\n* Razor & Blade: After enjoying mellow shaves with Kai Titan ACs and GEMs, this combo was like a face scalpel! Lots of blade feel, more aggressive shave by far. Extremely efficient, but my visage was a bit perturbed at the end of a three pass. (Once again, I am confronted with a moderately stubbly face even after a two pass with a sharp blade. So it looks as if nothing out there will give me a two pass BBS...)\n\n* The cold water splash and post shave saved the day, so no issues, but this shave was more of a Korean War than Gulf War kinda thing. i.e. razor and blade created a sense of struggle that barely worked out in the end.\n\n* The fit and finish of the ATT was superb, much higher than on the RR Hawk V2 (which, in fairness, is a third of the ATT's price) and I found the mildly controversial bamboo handle to be grippy and ergonomic, so liked it a lot.\n\n* The razor definitely shaves well and is a keeper, but I may use only Kai Titan Milds, dependent on a) how well the Feather gentles out over time, and b) how many uses I get from it. I only got 7 good shaves from the Kai, which given its higher pricing vis a vis both Feather Pro ACs and DE blades, may be a disincentive to further AC use for me. The shave today was great, but I have gotten just as good shaves from GEMs and numerous DEs.\n\n* Soap: the medicinal note first perceived at purchase (the monarda?) has faded quite a bit and this is more foresty now, as intended. Performance was somewhere between Glissant and Reserve, a solid A-.\n\n* Frag: Another very versatile scent, a clever fougere that works wonders with anise. Marred only by a fairly short wearing time, 4-6 hours at most. Still a great bargain, and a great men's fragrance classic.",

It felt like nothing was being cut. In any event, I switched up to R3 after the first pass and it got better from there, but the damage was done. This ASP may be kinda faulty too.

The conventional wisdom is that it's an extremely mild razor, and when I tried one a few years back I found that somehow, I managed to get a bunch of weepers despite not getting a close shave. I have a nice looking one in my Big Bucket of SE Razors, so I got it out and... had a fantastic shave! Nice and smooth and very very close, too, not too different than what I get from my beloved ER 1914 (though much less audible feedback). Quite a revelation. Now I've got to reevaluate everything I thought I knew about these old SE razors.\n\nSpeaking of old, my tub of Lavanille is from the very first batches, before it was brown. I swear the soap in these white tubs smells different (and better!) than any later iterations of Lavanille. And the veggie Tre Citta base, discontinued for a few years now, still stands with the best of the current crop.\n\nThe aftershave is a mixture of Thayers Lavender Witch Hazel, Agua Lavanda Puig, Pour un Homme de Caron, and a little menthol.\n\n",

Then today's recipe/procedures will get you there! It was so dense that I had to add a bit of water. A luxurious lather to ring in the 50th birthday of the Nacet.\n\nAnd today's lather wasn't complicated (a relative term, I understand). Here are three important things that really helped:\n\n* Stir through the airy lather. You'll be rewarded in a few minutes with the goodness that was graced upon me.\n* The hot water soap soak cut loading time down a lot (but if you're philosophically opposed to soaking, I guess you could try loading for about a minute or so).\n* I came into the soap with a pretty wet brush\n\n**Razor and Blade Notes** - *Gillette - Aristocrat 21 (UK) with Gillette - Nacet (50)*\n50-use blade cranked out a really good shave ... again. No irritation.\n\n**Soap Notes** - *Williams*\nI used the \"Easiest bowl way to creamy\" method below and got a dense, crazy-slick lather that was a pleasure to use.\n\nI did need to add a little water to the brush during application, so maybe less shakes next time?\n\nToday:\n\n1. Soak puck in hot water for 5-10 mins\n2. Dip brush fully in water (I just soak mine)\n3. Shake/jostle brush about 3 times to reduce water.\n4. Load brush: 30 sec\n5. Work up in bowl to a dense creamy lather!\n\n(This is good for my fairly young 24mm boar brush. A larger brush that holds more water would need adjustment.)\n\nScent strength\nDay 1-2: 3-4/10\nDay 4-5: 2-3/10\nDay 6-7: 2/10\nDay 8-~: 1/10\n\nBest Lathers So Far:\n\n* Maybe best cut ... *Soak*: 7mins (hot); *Shake brush*: 0, but hold until drained; *Load*: 30 sec; *Addt'nl water in bowl*: 0. With this one, lather is a little thinner than what might be called creamy, but the cut result on my trouble spot was nigh perfect.\n* Easiest bowl way to creamy ... *Soak*: 7mins (hot); *Shake brush*: 3 medium-light ones; *Load*: 30 sec; *Addt'nl water in bowl*: 0.\n* The long way ... Bloomed soap (cool water) for 26 mins (that long probably not necessary), 30 sec load with barely damp brush, then ended up adding to a total of 2 tsp water. Looked more like other soaps this time as it became more elastic and hydrated. Had a little cushion, bubbles were very minimal, and was well-slick.\n* Best Face Lather ...

Love the handle but it's the scratchiest of all my brushes--more than I really like. Hoping it softens a bit more. This was also my first sample of any MLS soap. I really enjoyed the scent out of the jar but found that it weakened once lathered. Performance was nice, especially considering that I was at the tail end of this blade (quick run of the alum bar got very little feedback). Nivea used to be my default post-shave. I've broadened my horizons to splashes but still like to use this once a week or so, or whenever I feel the need for additional moisturizing. I like that it's so easy to apply and get 100% coverage (with splashes I sometimes wonder if I missed a spot). Also, I bought a 3 pack of it off Amazon, so I need to work through that inventory ;-)",

This time when I ordered some EdT samples, I decided to order a sample of the shaving soap. I love this so much. I have been borderline obsessed with the bath soap and hope this will be in the next wave of EdTs they produce (I remember a schedule some time back but couldn't seem to locate it). I got that nice Stirling lather explosion-this time I actually had proof because when I hit that sweet spot I got lather all over the mirror. I don't have the matching aftershave, but have said before that it seems to smell fairly similar to Seville, so I went with that aftershave-as if I need another excuse.",

This razor is on loan from /u/Eric--m (Thanks!), and this is the second shave with it.\n\nYesterday's shave was a little (unnecessarily) rushed, and only got a 2 pass in. Today's was a full 3 pass. I wanted to try this to compare to the Ti2 version, which is the same geometry, just different material. It does feel slightly different. Aside from the weight difference, I got a little more blade feel than the Ti2, but the end results felt the same for me.\n\nI will note that with the material difference, less pressure was used/needed to cut with the 17-4, translation: more pressure on the Ti2 is needed. This doesn't bother me, it makes a little more idiot proof when in a rush.\n\nOverall a DFS, zero complaints!\n\nHope everyone is having a nice Friday!",

I had a couple minutes to do this one, though, and this one is quite special to me. For the first time ever, I'm marching the pregame show with the Michigan Marching Band. After working hard the past year, I finally challenged successfully and became a part of this week's show. (Each week the band members have to \"challenge\" successfully by playing and marching in front of the rest of the band to earn their spot on the field)\n\nI have wanted to be in this band for what feels like forever, so getting to sprint out of the tunnel and onto the field at a packed Michigan Stadium with 110,000+ people in it is going to be fantastic. For that reason, I chose to use Leviathan today. It feels like the perfect scent to pair with the fall weather and what I get to do today.\n\nHappy Saturday, all! GO BLUE, BEAT THE CORNHUSKERS!",

I can see why Stirling is often mentioned for noobs, it's a nice, inexpensive soap that performs well. I was able to get a nice thick lather and shaved with no issues whatsoever. The soap isn't the absolute slickest nor does it have the newest hype of post shave feel, but it's a solid performer sold at the right price.\n\nNow...we just need someone else to \"sell out\" and dupe this scent in a tier one base.",

Granted, here today the high is 88 but I still had to break out a cooler weather scent to celebrate today. So out of the cabinet came Leviathan! Damn I didn't realize just how much I missed it lol. I used it for a while in the cooler weather and on into spring. I finally decided to put it aside when my soap collection grew exponentially and I wanted to save this wonderful stuff for this year. Now, once again most everyone here has at least tried he Glissant base so I won't go into boring detail about the slickness and cushion that makes it one of, if not THE best soap based available. So onto the scent! I can't rave enough about how much I love this shit. It opens with a bright hit of coffee that quickly leads into a muted leather scent while everything is twirled around a creamy sandalwood. I've never smelled a coffee scent quite like this before and I can't quite get over how artfully bright it is. Normally, when coffee is a note, you get a deep, dark, cavernous scent that I've always enjoyed but this is just something special here. And I love how the leather is not just POW in your face but is instead presented in a humble and not overly forward way. Bah... I'm not good at this shit so I'll quit blathering. If you haven't at least smelled it, you need to fix that shit asap.",

I hadn't used Cella in over three years, but I remembered it being pretty average. I'd say that my shave this morning matches up to that impression. The smell is mid strong of almonds and marzipan. The lather is easy to build, but very much average in cushion and slickness. All in all, this is a perfectly fine soap that won't break the bank. However, I probably wouldn't recommend it to anyone in the US or Canada as we have so many better options in the same price range.",

In hindsight, and in light of today's shave, I think it was just the crappy travel brush i was testing at the same time (which I ended up throwing out).",

This is a very interesting scent that is woody, smoky and grassy. I wouldn't personally describe it as dirty, but it's definitely in the earthy vein. It almost has a cedar smell to me. It's extremely well done, and I think if you like vetiver this is a must buy. For the more casual vetiver fans, it's a more difficult decision, but I'd say I'm in the casual fan camp (or maybe even not a fan) and I really enjoyed it. It's a perfect fall and winter scent.",

I probably spent a good 60% of my past week in the library to study for my urology/endocrine/reproductive exam. Seven days to get in seven weeks' of material, I guess. Got to sleep in, gonna go on a coffee date, and then grab some tomatoes from the farmer's market. Probably going to take today off to relax before being productive again tomorrow. I picked up a couple more research projects that I need to go over and I need to get started on finishing up my initial project..\n\nSince I've been so busy with school in general, I haven't really shaved as often as before (maybe 1-2x a week, maybe every other week) and I've lost a little more interest in this hobby in lieu of others (getting into sourdough right now). I definitely miss interacting with this community, though. It's so weird being out of the loop after being in said loop for like 2 straight years.",

First time I have tried this brand and I have to say I was shocked to find out this is a vegan soap--had me fooled. This is about the most creamy luxurious lather I've experienced in an artisan vegan soap. I also really liked the scent, which is hard to describe...there is a soft \"wood\" note and also a mild \"spice\" overlay that reminds me of chai or something. The post shave was also great--marred only by a careless knick around my mustache area (my bad). This Dr. Jon aftershave is really interesting to me too. It combines two of my favorite scent notes (citrus & cedar) in succession. When I spray it on, it's a strong citrus scent...after about 15 mins the cooling fades and a cedar scent takes over.",

It handled the old blade well, and I can tell it will be a good shaver when I get newer blades in the rotation.\n\nBlade still doing well!\n\n\n\n**Soap Notes** ^Williams\nI used a mod of the \"Easiest bowl way to creamy\" method below and got a slick lather that, had worlds of elasticity, and was protective.\n\nThis time, for grins, I poured the thin excess water-lather from the mug (I think this brush doesn't hold as much water as my WD Boar) into the lather bowl. Turned out to be a good idea if I was going for an ultra-hydrated, slick performance lather, but it wasn't dense like yesterday.\n\nI hit Williams again, because my nose is so stuffed that I'm not really able to enjoy an interesting scent. And... I am close to killing this puck. Maybe one week or two. But I'm close!\n\nToday:\n\n1. Soak puck in hot water for 5-10 mins\n2. Dip brush fully in water (I just soak mine)\n3. Shake/jostle brush about 0 times to reduce water.\n4. Load brush: 30 sec\n5. Work up in bowl to an elastic creamy lather!\n\nHad plenty of lather left over. Try 20 sec load next time.\n\n(This is good for my brush. A larger brush that holds more water would need adjustment.)\n\nScent strength\nDay 1-2: 3-4/10\nDay 4-5: 2-3/10\nDay 6-7: 2/10\nDay 8-~: 1/10\n\nBest Lathers So Far:\n\n* Maybe best cut ... *Soak*: 7mins (hot); *Shake brush*: 0, but hold until drained; *Load*: 30 sec; *Addt'nl water in bowl*: 0. With this one, lather is a little thinner than what might be called creamy, but the cut result on my trouble spot was nigh perfect.\n* Easiest bowl way to creamy ... *Soak*: 7mins (hot); *Shake brush*: 3 medium-light ones; *Load*: 30 sec; *Addt'nl water in bowl*: 0.\n* The long way ... Bloomed soap (cool water) for 26 mins (that long probably not necessary), 30 sec load with barely damp brush, then ended up adding to a total of 2 tsp water. Looked more like other soaps this time as it became more elastic and hydrated. Had a little cushion, bubbles were very minimal, and was well-slick.\n* Best Face Lather ... No soap soak; Load: 60 secs; Brush Shakes: 5 med-light. First pass could have been thicker but rest were great.\n\n\n\n\n**Brush Notes** - *Semogue OC*\nI wanted to compare the SOC, one of my favorite Boars, with the Whipped Dog Boar I had used all of Austere August. Turns out, that right now, I think I like the WD boar better. It's more dense. I feel like I have better coverage. Now, things could change in 100 uses of both brushes, but that's where they stand now.\n**Shave Quality**\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Very Close Shave\n*Neck*: Few hairs are showing some tip length (with most being cut flush)\n\nEdit: formatting.\n----\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger**\n\nUse this to document how long our blades last, if you want, and what about them made us pitch 'em. I created a Google Form with just a few questions:\n\n[Ending of Blades Ledger](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform)\n\n[The Ledger Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing) in case you want to just look at the data.\n\nI'll keep this as my footer each SOTD so you have the link. I'll take it down if no one shows interest.",

I was actually able to get a decent shave, I had to cheat on the last past of my lip but overall a nice shave. I decided to go with Proraso since I've never tried that brand before. It wasn't bad had a very mild scent and it's a bit heavy on the menthol but tolerable.",

This will definitely be one of my guilty pleasure soaps. Fall is my favorite season, and one of the many things I love that comes with fall is pumpkin spice. Love it in my coffee or foods, and now in my soap. This scent hits the nail on the head for pumpkin spice, so there isn't really too much to explain about it. It's a great mix with cinnamon, and totally smells like fall to me.\n\nFor performance, Stirling is one of the best bang for your buck companies around. This was a huge soap sample for only a couple of bucks, and it has great performance. Once loaded up, when you start lathering, it will eventually explode into a nice, slick lather with enough water. I know with this soap in particular some people have irritation because of the cinnamon, but that was not an issue for me. Highly recommend it.\n\nHappy Saturday everyone!",

It's been warm the last few weeks in Milwaukee and I've been holding out on this set for the right time since it arrived. This morning it was a crisp 46 degrees and partly cloudy in southeastern Wisconsin, and the forecast called for the temperature to not top 60 degrees. Today was the day.\n\n/u/BostonPhotoTourist's scent description and notes for the scent are as follows:\n\n> Anyone who's been there will tell you that, in New England, Autumn is the best time of year. The trees turn vivid colors, the weather becomes perfectly brisk, and the apple and corn crops are harvested and made into all kinds of wonderful foods to enjoy. The scent of woodsmoke fills the air and fallen leaves litter the ground, crunching pleasantly underfoot wherever you go. It's a wonderful time, and at the center of it all is the cider mill.\n\n> Cider mills are incredible places. The smell of apples suffuses the walls and a wood fire usually burns in the corner. Trays and trays of apple cider donuts fill the tables and counters next to carafes of hot cider and coffee. The buildings smell wonderful and we wanted to capture that smell in soap form. After long experimentation, we blended the scents of apples, newly fallen leaves, woodsmoke, benzoin, and the faintest touch of cinnamon to create a slightly smokey, faintly spicy, wonderful scent perfect for the crisp, clear days of Autumn.\n\nI may not be in the upper northeast, but this description deeply resonated with me. My childhood apple orchard was [Nieman Orchard in Cedarburg, WI](http://www.flickr.com/photos/68470204@N07/sets/72157627734779353/) and right off the puck, this soap brought me back to those mid-autumn days as a child bundling up and driving out to the orchard, waiting for the hay ride out to the trees, crunching the dead leaves under your feet, coming back with a bucket full of apples, and warming up with a cup of hot apple cider in the barn while browsing all the other homemade goodies.\n\nAfter doing some yard work outside on this beautiful early autumn day, it was time to break out this seasonal soap and splash for their first shave. The first smell off the puck is a delicious, sweet apple, followed by a dusty barn wood (cedar?). Once I began to lather, the cinnamon, smoke, and the earthy, dead leaves smell came forward. The shave was that same slick glissant base goodness that we all know and love, and the aftershave doubled up on all the scent notes above.\n\nWill, you crushed it with this one, and I'll be using it routinely until the very last leaf has fallen and apple has been picked. I raise my cider (maybe mixed with a bit of bourbon...) to you for this wonderful effort.\n\nCheers!",

This is the more aggressive Game Changer, and I think it runs a nice line between efficient cutting and comfort, and all this with a 51-use old blade. The mild one is, for me at least, ineffectual junk ... but this one is a keeper, at least based off my first impression. However, I don't really consider it aggressive, at this point. For me, it sits in a very nice middle ground.\n\nStill not worthy, IMO, of a magnanimous title like \"Game Changer\" but a good razor nonetheless. (it really is a pet peeve of mine when people hype up something without real substantiation) I guess they called it what they did because they were offering a well-made stainless steel razor for around $50. Which is great, but still...\n\nAnyway, I think this is a great offering to the community. In most cases, it would be well worth getting this one over any Merkur, Parker, or Jagger (or other zamak razor) that I can think of. The only catch might be that this one is not as mild as some of those. But I can't say for sure yet, since I've just used this one very-used blade.\n\nBlade still working well and gave me an above average shave in this .85 GC.\n\nNo irritation, even with the alcohol splash.\n\n## Soap Notes\n*^(Williams)*\n\nI used a mod of the \"Easiest bowl way to creamy\" method below and got a slick lather that, had worlds of elasticity, and was protective.\n\nI hit Williams again, because my nose is so stuffed that I'm not really able to enjoy an interesting scent. And... I am close to killing this puck.\n\nToday:\n\n1. Soak puck in hot water for 5-10 mins\n2. Dip brush fully in water (I just soak mine)\n3. Shake/jostle brush about 0 times to reduce water.\n4. Load brush: 30 sec (I was going to try 20, but I was trying a new brush for Williams, and wanted to play it safe)\n5. Work up in bowl to an elastic, slick lather!\n\n(This is good for my brush. A larger brush that holds more water would need adjustment, etc.)\n\nScent strength - Day 1-2: 3-4/10; Day 4-5: 2-3/10; Day 6-7: 2/10; Day 8-~: 1/10\n\nBest Lathers So Far:\n\n* Maybe best cut ... *Soak*: 7mins (hot); *Shake brush*: 0, but hold until drained; *Load*: 30 sec; *Addt'nl water in bowl*: 0. With this one, lather is a little thinner than what might be called creamy, but the cut result on my trouble spot was nigh perfect.\n* Easiest bowl way to creamy ... *Soak*: 7mins (hot); *Shake brush*: 3 medium-light ones; *Load*: 30 sec; *Addt'nl water in bowl*: 0.\n* The long way ... Bloomed soap (cool water) for 26 mins (that long probably not necessary), 30 sec load with barely damp brush, then ended up adding to a total of 2 tsp water. Looked more like other soaps this time as it became more elastic and hydrated. Had a little cushion, bubbles were very minimal, and was well-slick.\n* Best Face Lather ... No soap soak; Load: 60 secs; Brush Shakes: 5 med-light. First pass could have been thicker but rest were great.\n\n## Shave Quality\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Few hairs are showing some tip length (with most being cut flush)\n\n----\n\n# Ending of Blades Ledger\n\nUse this to document how long our blades last, if you want, and what about them made us pitch 'em. I created a Google Form with just a few questions:\n\n[Ending of Blades Ledger](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform)\n\n[The Ledger Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing) in case you want to just look at the data.\n\nI'll keep this as my footer each SOTD so you have the link. I'll take it down if no one shows interest.",

I quite like this one. It's very mild and inoffensive, yet it doesn't just smell like off-brand hand soap. The shave was pretty typical for a TOBS cream. The lather was easy to build and the cushion was excellent. The residual slickness and glide are pretty average and not in the same league as the top tier artisan soaps. However, the post shave feel is perfectly fine with no complaints. Given that these soaps are quite inexpensive when they go on sale, I could definitely see myself picking up a tub of this at some point in the future.\n",

I watched a video yesterday about how to create a super shiny and dense lather (search Merkur Man on YouTube), so I thought I'd give it a shot. It did produce a very dense and shiny lather, but it takes much longer than my usual technique of using a medium damp brush. Still, it was a beautiful lather, and possibly the best one I've had with icarus. I'll probably keep experimenting with this method a bit.",

Overall I would say this is my second most favorite barbershop scent.",

Today is the last day of wildcard week, and as I made this week an almost \"mini-month\" I figured first snow was a great way to transition into fall/winter week. First Snow is simple with just fir and leather scent notes. It's not complex, but it is nicely blended. To me, it has a somewhat warm scent and when I read the name and smelled it, it did somewhat evoke the smell of a first snow.\n\nThe performance is typical of Barrister and Mann, and performs very well. Had a nice, slick lather today that offered great protection. Followed it up with the matching aftershave sample, which was nice close to the shave. It was a good day to use this soap here as it is somewhat cold and rainy. I guess fall is in full swing.\n\nHave a relaxing Sunday everyone.",

Turns out TTS suggested a soap and splash for which I had samples laying around. Hooray for synergy!\n\nSo here I sit, smelling fantastic, the only human awake in the house. It's 53 degrees and cloudy out there. High of 65. Might be a decent day to pop over into our scenic downtown area and poke my head into some of the antique shops. And the bakery. I do love that bakery.",

Yesterday, I went to work and got off early so I could go to the SoCal Wet Shavers Meetup. I took my daughter so my wife can have some peace and quiet and work on dinner. The meetup went well. There was a nice PIF table and a bunch of stuff got raffled off. I ended up winning a couple of Regiment soaps and a nice brush handle from King Shave. Now I need to get a knot for it - maybe a B6. :) We got home from that and prepared to dinner. We had some special guests over for dinner, namely my mother and grandmother. My wife made a delicious homemade fried chicken with mashed potatoes, corn and biscuits. I'm getting hungry just typing it. Today, though, is a more relaxing day. Happy Sunday, all.",

Pretty sure this sample is the cream, but it could also be a very soft soap. I lathered in a bowl and it took quite a bit of water, but ultimately got a very dense lather, which was also very slick. The scent description notes cedar, bergamot, and tobacco. I picked up on the bergamot but otherwise it seemed like the strongest note was a sort of juniper scent? I liked it. Not as \"woody\" as I was expecting, but very pleasant to use and a good performer. I picked the Nivea balm because the bottle is almost empty and I'm trying to clear space on the shelf for my inbound order of CL LFdL.",

There's something about this tub that calms me down and I really get in a groove. The aftershave has the perfect amount of menthol. Ahhhhh... Since I don't have the Bon Vivant EdT I usually pair it with Seville for the sweetness but today I decided to play on the birch tar in Darkfall and it's a great combo!

Discovered it's the only head, due to it's mildness, that I can go ATG with on my neck!\n\n## Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Karve Bradley with Gillette - Nacet ‹53 uses›)*\n\nHad to end up going ATG on my neck to get most of the trouble spot hairs. Had to employ some skin shifting to get them as well. But soap protected really well, and I got no irritation, even from the 52-use old blade.\n\nThis is better than my previous try, but it seems clear that such an old blade just works much better in a more aggressive razor.\n\nA Very Very smooth shave!\n\n## Soap Notes\n*^(Williams)*\n\nI used a mod of the \"Easiest bowl way to creamy\" method below and got a slick lather that, had worlds of elasticity, and was supremely protective. This was especially helpful today, because the mild razor needed a few touch-up passes on the neck to finish.\n\nI hit Williams again, because my nose is so stuffed that I'm not really able to enjoy an interesting scent. And... I am close-ish to killing this puck.\n\nToday:\n\n1. Soak puck in hot water for 5-10 mins\n2. Dip brush fully in water (I just soak mine)\n3. Shake/jostle brush about 2 times to reduce water.\n4. Load brush: 20 sec\n5. Work up in bowl to an elastic, slick lather!\n\nI did have to add 1/2 tsp of water to this lather to rein it in.\n\n(This is good for my brush. A larger brush that holds more water would need adjustment, etc.)\n\nScent strength - Day 1-2: 3-4/10; Day 4-5: 2-3/10; Day 6-7: 2/10; Day 8-~: 1/10\n\nBest Lathers So Far:\n\n* Maybe best cut ... *Soak*: 7mins (hot); *Shake brush*: 0, but hold until drained; *Load*: 30 sec; *Addt'nl water in bowl*: 0. With this one, lather is a little thinner than what might be called creamy, but the cut result on my trouble spot was nigh perfect.\n* Easiest bowl way to creamy ... *Soak*: 7mins (hot); *Shake brush*: 3 medium-light ones; *Load*: 30 sec; *Addt'nl water in bowl*: 0.\n* The long way ... Bloomed soap (cool water) for 26 mins (that long probably not necessary), 30 sec load with barely damp brush, then ended up adding to a total of 2 tsp water. Looked more like other soaps this time as it became more elastic and hydrated. Had a little cushion, bubbles were very minimal, and was well-slick.\n* Best Face Lather ... No soap soak; Load: 60 secs; Brush Shakes: 5 med-light. First pass could have been thicker but rest were great.\n\n## Shave Quality\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Smooth\n*Neck*: Smooth\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Few hairs are showing some tip length (with most being cut flush)\n\n----\n\n# Ending of Blades Ledger\n\nUse this to document how long our blades last, if you want, and what about them made us pitch 'em.

Autumn Glory is a great fall scent. It really does invoke autumn smells for me. It's like taking a walk outside after a rain shower, with all the newly fallen, colorful leaves on the ground. It has a soothing, and somewhat damp smell to it. I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for just a straightforward scent reminiscent of the fall.\n\nAs great as this scent is, Stirling's performance is also very good. Once loaded, you need to add water in but by bit, and at a point, the lather explodes. I always get a solid lather from Stirling and today was no different. Very slick and protective, and overall a great shave. I followed it up with the matching aftershave sample, and had an excellent start to the day.\n\nI hope everyone has a good Monday; it is going to be a long one for me today.",

I snagged it when Will put the Latha line on sale and just immediately set it aside. Performance is fucking wonderful and damn I LOVE the scent! As for the cologne, I was in TJ Maxx back in the earlier part of the summer with my wife and jokingly grabbed a bottle (I mean for $1.50, who cares?). I figured it would work with the Taiga and I think it really does! I mean, this is the shit if you wanna smell just like a Christmas tree whenever the hell you feel like it.

We have Icarus, Bison, NO, SW, Reserve, and many others. It's amazing how many scents and great bases we have at our liking right now and it is fantastic. Hard to find anything wrong with Icarus as it is an all around great soap and performs fantastic. The animal funk is gone after a few lathers and just smells like a beautiful oatmeal ocean (oats in the base). Highly recommend this base to anyone who hasn't tried it yet.\n\nHappy Monday",

Not for lack of choices, mind you. I've got two big ol boxes *full* of bad choices. Today's choice was actually based another choice. A choice that for many of us, may be one of the worst decisions we could make. The choice to not only forsake our marital vows, but then to also *choose* to blast that decision on social media, in a very weird, very uncomfortable public flogging, with one person playing the town crier, flogger, priest, and victim all in one. And oh boy what a show it's been.\n\nIn the same vein, I do not enjoy this soap. At least, not the scent. The performance is ...passable. Nothing terrible, but not worth keeping around really. And again, fucking coconut oil finds its way into the ingredient list, though thankfully it's not the very first one. (Lookin at you, you fucking pirate.) Wisdom is a blend of lavender and peppermint, and is supposed to evoke relaxation and calmness, but instead I get cheap massage parlor with some \"extras\" thrown in for a few bucks for the masseuse who barely speaks English. Maybe that's where the whole infidelity thing started....hmmm. This one is getting rinsed off and put back in the giant PIF Shit Box, lest I'm tempted to start texting some old acquaintances from my little black book behind my wifes back.\n",

With this soap base, I think a normal price is warranted, but I would buy at the price I've seen some of their stuff at.",

It's been a while since I used this scent. A wonderful reunion to be sure. CFG soaps lather so easily. They may not be in the top tier of slickness anymore, but they are not far behind, and are perfectly serviceable soaps. And the scents that CFG puts out are so wonderful.\n\nI spent all of yesterday running [drip irrigation/micro spray irrigation](https://www.waterirrigation.co.uk/media/catalog/category/Micro_Sprays_1.jpg) to all the new planter beds in our backyard. I'm glad it's done, and while it wasn't hard work like planting, it still took all day. Getting coverage on round/sweeping shaped beds without watering the patios and walk ways is a art, man. Art. And unfortunately, I'm not a great artist.\n\nBut it's done and I can stop hand watering the 1.4 million plants that wife planted back there. So it was worth the effort.\n",

The head design tends to lead one to the correct angle, and so the 1912 is not hard to get used to. The 1912 and the Pushbutton have the same problem with ATG cutting under the nose, as unless you have an arctic tundra sized plateau there, you will not be able to get an effective angle and will end up tomahawking the blade into your face with poor results. The Pushbutton can be gingerly used to give an ATG pass there but it is not happy, while the 1912 just refuses.\n\n* Fortunately, two WTG and an XTG pass got stuff reasonably smooth in that spot, and ATG passes work well on all other areas of my face that have more \"positioning room\". A very good pain free shave that produced a long lasting BBS with three passes. Thanks /u/Old_Hiker!\n\n* Frag: Very similar to Chanel Egoiste with more citrus and powder. Hence very pleasant, and also much cheaper than Chanel! The projection and longevity are definitely similar to a good EDT though, so don't be fooled by the \"Cologne\" in the name. Also, box proudly proclaims that the product contains Mysore sandalwood. For less than $1 a mL? Color me skeptical, but in any case, smells good, costs little = winning combo.\n",

It is very soft, so overload can be a thing, but I only scooped out an almond size lump into a loading bowl and it provided plenty of luscious lather.

I had no idea what Russian Leather is supposed to smell like, but out of the jar my first impression was.... \"grandpa.\" It's a musky smell, closest comparison to another scent I've tried would be Tabac. Notwithstanding the pleasant nostalgia of recalling my deceased grandpa, this isn't exactly my cup of tea--glad I went with the sample before purchasing. I wasn't able to detect any coffee in the soap, but I did get it from the splash (though it fades quickly and reverts to the musky base). After several days of shaving with my Slim, going back to the Game Changer with a new Nacet blade was like putting on a pair of comfortable shoes. This is now officially my favorite razor. Apologies in advance for the lack of razor variety in my future SOTD pics--I'll probably be using this one most of the time.",

Once I lathered it up though it turned into a very heavy coffee, the kind that's been brewing all day in a pot that hasn't been washed for a good long while. After rinsing my face and before the aftershave the leather did return, very muted but it was there. I can see why this soap is so controversial, for me I think I'll put this in the pass list. Not that it's bad, it's just not my style of scent. Now if they were to make a soap that smelled like the container smell on lathering, I would be all over that.",

Yup, I still feel the same. I have one additional detail to add though, the Ti 2 gives a LOT more audible feedback. Almost like the 'spreading butter on toast' sound of the vintage Gem/Ever Ready SE gives. Love it!!!\n\nAbsolutely awesome shave today. DFS and I'm feeling good!!!\n\nHope everyone has a great day!!!\n=)",

I get the apples and fallen leaves scent but I may just have to finish the sample before deciding if it's worth buying the full tub.\n\nI recently acquired a Karve 3\" C via trade from the Bazaar. It's a fantastic razor with just the right amount of heft, balance and the C plate was perfect. I was able to find the cutting angle quickly with no issues whatsoever.\n\nA mail call item that I was beyond excited to try out was the Mozingo Frozen handle with 26mm B6 knot. The handle looks and feels fantastic in hand. This is my first time trying a Declaration knot and it did not disappoint one bit. The characteristics of the B6 may change after a few shaves based on some of the feedback with the tips hooking and gelling. Right out the box there was no discernible smell and the knot felt very soft yet had a decent amount of backbone, but not too much. It also had the right amount of density which allowed it feel pillow soft and still have a backbone. I can't wait to see how this breaks in.\n\nAnother mail call item that I used tonight was the Barrister and Mann 22mm synthetic brush. It's a nice small brush that will be perfect for travel. I also enjoyed the handle as I don't currently have a brush with a handle of that type of style.\n\nedit: added pic",

Nocturne is an awesome fall scent. When the leaves start turning and the weather cools down, it turns to my favorite time of year. In the fall, one of the things I love doing is going apple picking. This scent totally encompasses that. It also smells like walking into a cider mill, with a light cinnamon scent with some fire burning for warmth in the background. As someone from the northeast, smelling this scent totally reminded me of home in the fall. I would highly recommend this scent to anyone for a great fall smell that invokes many memories of this time of year.\n\nThe performance is typical of B&M, which is great. Very slick and easy to lather, and offered great protection. Today I had a great shave with this, and then followed it up with the matching Nocturne aftershave sample. Great shave today.\n\nHave a great Tuesday everyone!",

The rain could be heavy at times. High near 61. East wind 5 to 15 mph becoming southeast in the morning. Chance of precipitation is 90%. New precipitation amounts between a half and three quarters of an inch possible. High tide at 12:12 this afternoon.\n\nI didn't pick up the Night Music EdT when this set was re-released but Cape Heartache matches pretty nicely. The strawberry notes match up perfectly. I smell like sex in forest.\n\nThe brush is a bit more scritchy than I remember, but it's been awhile since I've used it. I like the handle shape, it fits nicely in the hand. The hair, like I said, is a bit scritchy, but not B3 levels. It's also not as dense as Declaration knots leading to not as much backbone and much more splay. Will take a little bit of getting use to.\n\nHave a nice Tuesday everyone!",

This new SW base is very, very good. It's a marked improvement from the old base, which I also enjoyed. The residual slickess seems to be greatly improved and the face feel is much fattier feeling. I'll definitely be picking up a full tub when it's released next month.\n\nThe CL skin salve was also very good. It's thick and feels protective. This isn't an everyday lotion--it seems like it would be great for the dry, cold months due to its richness. The unscented version has a very slight almost medicinal smell but it's not bad and faded quickly. I'll likely be picking up the lavender and citrus versions.",

One thing that I noticed right away is that even though they use the Icarus base, they don't seem to have the gaminess that I put me off a bit with the Sweet Lemon/Contemplation scents. Maybe the base has been tweaked a bit, or maybe the darker scents cover up the gaminess better, but I really can't detect it at all with either of these soaps. Obviously, the soap base is top tier, but somehow I feel like I had a much better experience with this version of the Icarus base (compared to the summer releases). I'll definitely be buying a set of one of these...I just need to try them both and figure out which one.",

The first was a handful of EdT samples from Stirling. And the second was a couple of samples from Summer Break Soaps that I got for my wife. Anyway, I wanted to try out Baker Street today because I've never had my hands on it before. It seems like a very clean smell is all I can say. Maybe it's being slightly muted by the aftershave, but I'll make sure I sneak one more half spray before I leave for work so that maybe I can get a better idea about the notes. These days, I glance at note profiles before I purchase but don't look again until after I've smelled it a time or two. I'm trying to train my nose and my brain to pick up on individual notes and I can't think of a better way than to just TRY.\n\nNow, onto the actual shave itself. The new NO base is in the top tier of bases in my opinion. Shit's fantastic!! Every time I've even cracked open the soap, it just smells like damp evergreen woods with a little pop of juniper berries in there to brighten it all up without overpowering anything. The aftershave leaves my skin feeling refreshed and supple.",

I have not been able to dial in the correct amount of water for the knoot yet for this soap.\n\nRipped a large piece of skin off climbing last night on a problem I am projecting. Made it halfway which was a huge improvement since my last go. Really glad I am getting back to the gym after all the craziness the last few months.",

I couldn't figure out whey direction I wanted to take today's post. [Do I bring up their hilariously bad decision-making?](https://streamable.com/4zhp3) Or do I poke at their extraordinarily ...ordinary product, which ordinarily is pretty ordinary, and *that's* being extraordinarily kind. This is not a good soap. I mean, NONE of the soaps I've been using are really good soaps, some are simply more passable than others, some more soapy-urinal-cake than others, but Masons finds a way to be so...un good. Coconut oil is the second listed ingredient(I'm sensing a theme here), the lather never really gets anywhere other than foamy, no matter how much soap and/or water I use, and it smells like fucking handmade play dough. Remember when you were in school, or maybe when your kids were in school? And they learned how to make salt dough out of water, salt, and flour? Yeah, that's EXACTLY what this smells like. It smelled like I was shaving in a shitty daycare full of whinging adults that were crying because no one wants to buy their subpar soap.\n\nHappy fucking Tuesday.",

It was so hard for me to keep the right angle, because it was different... way different ... than my usual angles. It was so rough.\n\nBut today, I got a great shave, with no irritation ...even after dousing myself in some alc-based HeV splash.\n\n## Soap Notes\n*^(Williams)*\n\nSo I did mix it a little thin, which was more of a problem than usual, apparently, because the stiffness (due to newness) of this brush didn't really let it hold too much soap. Was pretty funny actually. It felt more like some trick novelty soap.\n\nBut it was just a lesson on how a good slick soap works well, even when thin. I got no irritation at all, and a very close shave.\n\nI used a mod of the \"Easiest bowl way to creamy\" method below and got a slick lather that, while I over-watered it just a hair, still protected well and gave good glide.\n\nI hit Williams again, because my nose is so stuffed that I'm not really able to enjoy an interesting scent. And... I am within a week or two from killing this puck.\n\nToday:\n\n1. Soak puck in hot water for 5-10 mins\n2. Dip brush fully in water (I just soak mine)\n3. Shake/jostle brush about 2 times to reduce water.\n4. Load brush: 15 sec (since the brush killed the lather, I'd go to 20-30)\n5. Work up in bowl to an elastic, slick lather!\n\nI did add 1/2 tsp of water to this lather to keep it from being too rich... so I thought at the time. Probably should have added nothing.\n\n(This is good for my brush. A larger brush that holds more water would need adjustment, etc.)\n\nScent strength - Day 1-2: 3-4/10; Day 4-5: 2-3/10; Day 6-7: 2/10; Day 8-~: 1/10\n\nBest Lathers So Far:\n\n* Maybe best cut ... *Soak*: 7mins (hot); *Shake brush*: 0, but hold until drained; *Load*: 30 sec; *Addt'nl water in bowl*: 0. With this one, lather is a little thinner than what might be called creamy, but the cut result on my trouble spot was nigh perfect.\n* Easiest bowl way to creamy ... *Soak*: 7mins (hot); *Shake brush*: 3 medium-light ones; *Load*: 30 sec; *Addt'nl water in bowl*: 0.\n* The long way ... Bloomed soap (cool water) for 26 mins (that long probably not necessary), 30 sec load with barely damp brush, then ended up adding to a total of 2 tsp water. Looked more like other soaps this time as it became more elastic and hydrated. Had a little cushion, bubbles were very minimal, and was well-slick.\n* Best Face Lather ... No soap soak; Load: 60 secs; Brush Shakes: 5 med-light. First pass could have been thicker but rest were great.\n\n\n## Brush Notes\n*^(Declaration - B5 Rubr)*\n\nFirst use of this one for me. A little-used brush before me it seems. Knot was very narrow.\n\nBut I think it felt softer than my own B5. It did kill the thin Williams lather, though. So I'll have to mix it richer until the knot blooms more.\n## Shave Quality\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Few hairs are showing some tip length (with most being cut flush)\n\n----\n\n# Ending of Blades Ledger\n\nUse this to document how long our blades last, if you want, and what about them made us pitch 'em. I created a Google Form with just a few questions:\n\n[Ending of Blades Ledger](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform)\n\n[The Ledger Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing) in case you want to just look at the data.\n\nI'll keep this as my footer each SOTD so you have the link. I'll take it down if no one shows interest.",

I picked up on the currant, dark chocolate, and amber. Since I didn't have the matching toner, I paired it with what I figured would be a close approximation. Once lathered, I got more of a woody/vetiver scent and didn't notice the sweetness as much. It was a pretty mild scent on the lather, actually (unknown age on the sample--acquired via PIF). I keep working the badger brush into my rotation once a week or so, but I'm still not a big fan. While it produces and holds a ton of lather, it feels too bushy on my face and is hard to use with precision. Maybe I need a smaller knot? The CB splash is more bracing than most I have tried--my face felt really tight/dry after so I decided to use some Nivea balm for extra moisturizing. I can still smell the splash though--the scent has a lot of staying power.",

Youtube has been full of reviews for this soap, and people say it's pretty great.\n\nI was thinking to myself, how great can a pear scented scent be? Let alone, a pear scent with elements if barbershop. It sounded a little odd to me. But when I smelled it, I instantly fell in love. It's a great scent.\n\nIt's fruity, yes. But on the face you get engulfed in a light pear scent, a kiss if menthol and the powdery goodness of a great barbershop scent. This scent makes me think of something maybe an old time barber would have created, since in those days barbers often made their own aftershaves to use on their clients.\n\n9/10.",

Hallows is definitely a fall scent. A year ago, I got Fougere Gothique and loved it. I had never smelled hallows, but after getting this sample this year, I can say it smells similar to FG, but also different. It has the same kind of dark, musky, earthy smell, but where Hallows goes different, is that it has a somewhat cool feel to it. What I mean by that, is that it smells like a swampy area, with dying leaves during a cool day. I'm not the best at describing scents, and this one is a tough one to describe, but hopefully that paints somewhat of a picture. At the end of the day, I really do like it, and I am excited for me full set that is hopefully coming soon in the mail.\n\nFor performance, hallows produces a great lather from the B&M glissant base. I had an easy shave today, and at the end my face was feeling very nice. I followed the shave up with the matching Hallows aftershave sample, and I am definitely loving the way that all smells.\n\nHave an enjoyable Wednesday everyone!",

The scent on this soap was a big surprise to me because I really had no expectations and it smells wonderful. It's very fresh and piney. I might have to pick up the matching splash on this, which is a rare thing for me.\n\nI used the CL salve again today. This time I applied it basically right after applying the splash. I think I preferred this method as it took an extremely small amount of product and it went on much easier. My face is feeling great.",

Personally, this is one of my favorite scents on the market and I know /u/nameisjoey will back me up on this scent. It just smells fantastic and I look forward to being able to write up a small review about the EdT for everyone on here who may be thinking about buying it.\n\nHappy Wednesday!",

No frills or anything. Nice lather from the soap and nice skin feel from the aftershave. My only problem today is my neck. I've been using an open comb razor I got in a trade months ago and never got around to trying. Honestly love the fucker on my checks and such, but when I move down to my neck, I can only do two passes at most before I feel the irritation set in. This is my first open comb I've used and I know they're said to be more aggressive, but damn haha. I just know I need to be more mindful of my technique and quit gettin in a damn hurry.",

Also, I like the scent, it's definitely sandalwood but it's not super strong either.",

I always feel that this base is pretty intuitive to lather and it gives a close shave every time. The protection and slickness are decent, but the soap seems conducive to a rather efficient shave as well. I'm not completely sold on the scent for Courage, but if I could get ahold of some more soap samples from this artisan, I have a feeling that I'd be likely to buy one of their sets.",

This is so close to a perfect scent and one that I'll never go without. It just has the right combination of dirty and everything else that makes it warm and cozy especially on a dreary day. First use of my new broosh, and nothing about it really stuck out which isn't a bad thing. I've been warned it could take a couple uses to break in B6, but this first use was just fine to me. My baby face didn't detect any scrub or harshness, but it had been a couple days since I last shaved. The handle though, it's so much more beautiful in person than I can describe or what shows in pictures. The wood dye and grain is more detailed than what I can show and it's sparkly beyond belief. I had one of the early starscapes and this one is so much better, it's really fun to be there to see an artisan improve their craft like this.",

It's been a while since I've used it before this, but Glissant and Reserve are better by a long shot (I know, hot take of the day). I fiddled with lathering techniques and water ratios, but the lather always ends up too \"fluffy\". It doesn't get as dense or thick as what you can achieve with today's top of the line offerings. Still a *good* soap nonetheless. I'm not real crazy about the scent either, it's ok. To me it smells faintly like Seville with a sprinkle of vetiver and chocolate.\n\nAlso, I went back to the 0.68 plate on the GC today just for comparison's sake. This is a great razor if you just want an easy, smooth, carefree shave. I don't think the 0.84 plate offers that much of an increase in efficiency, mostly just more blade feel.\n\nA note on the aftershave, this was a surprise add to a recent trade and one I'd never used before. While I like the face feel and blast of menthol, the scent has this rather nasty cat piss note to it when first splashed on. Thankfully, that disappears quickly and the scent on the dry down is quite nice. Don't know if I'll be using the rest of this sample though. Happy hump day all!\n\n​",

It reminds me *a lot* of Stirling Texas on Fire, though with the smoke dialed down.\n\nThis shave also really confirmed for me that I really don't like the Icarus base nearly as much as the bison base. Had used it a few times when it first came out (Rose Santal I think?), but it's been a while. Thought my opinion might have changed, but nah. Nothing wrong with it, but I don't get the hype.\n\nHaven't using a G-Bar in a long time. After my revelation with the Pushbutton, I was guessing that I might experience the same with the G-Bar. It was better than I remembered (probably my technique is better), but still too mild for my taste. Good shave but had to spend more time touching up than usual.\n\nHaven't used Cologne Russe in a while either. It's a fall/winter scent for me. Was pleasantly surprised to remember just how good it is. Cologne Russe's scent is pretty much what I imagined bay rum would smell like before I had actually smelled bay rum.",

Yellow Brick Road\n**Post Shave:** Oz Shaving Co. Tornadic Post Shave Balm\n\n\nI saw the link in the Deals/New Products post yesterday for the Oz Shaving Co brushes and remembered that I had several samples I'd been meaning to try, so I decided to dig those out today. I went with Oz's Yellow Brick Road. The website says that the soaps are tallow based with shea butter, mango butter and cocoa butter-that's a lot of butter. The scent is Vetiver, Cedarwood and Bergamot, so I assume this is their take on the \"barbershop\" scent. To my untrained and unsophisticated nose, the Bergamot seems most forward, but overall, the scent is pretty light and smells very fresh and clean. It was a quick, no-fuss lather with a damp brush. A little bit of effort gave me tons of lather that was fairly slick and felt good, but did lack much discernible post shave residual slickness. Truth be told, that is never a deal breaker for me since I do love using aftershaves, but it is worth noting. I was careful not to go over the same spot too many times before relathering, which is something I rarely worry about with some of the elite soaps like the Reserve line. However, I still think this is a very good quality soap and would definitely use it again. Really, my biggest wish here would be that the scent was just a little stronger. The post shave balm was also from Oz and is called Tornadic. This is there fougere scent, but it was so lightly scented that I couldn't really make out what it smelled like. The consistency reminded me a lot of Nivea's post shave balms as it was thin and kind of milky. It went on easily and did seem to work adequately. Overall, I enjoyed the products and will certainly try more of their products in the future.",

Very easy to come together, I think I might have scooped a tad too much in the loading bowl as I had plenty of thick lather even after three passes. I saw these blades in my local store and took a chance, first impressions were not great but I will give them a few more shaves before they move to the back of my medicine cabinet.",

One little cut, but I felt that one when it happened so I am going to say my fault (especially since it was on a trouble spot) and if I did not know better, I would have sworn it was a Voskhod because very similar performance/smoothness. Makes me wonder if I should even test the Gillette Wilkinson Swords I still have to try. So far, these are the favorite.",

What an excellent climate to have fall and winter week! I've also taken my fall:winter soaps and splashes out for use starting next week. Boy it'll be nice to load out of a tub again! And a chance to use high end badgers again which I refrain from loading in my bowl because of he somewhat sharp edges in the bowl.\n\nI've found that I can use the ATT R1 for daily shaves, but I've gotta be careful.

It was hard as a rock!!! Last time I used it the ring of death was becoming prominent, so I used a spoon to form a mound in the middle of the tub to make for easier loading the next time I used it, which was today. It took quite a bit longer than normal to load, even with this B3 knot. Whatevs, that's part of the fun, and it was all worth it in the end, Bali Hai is one of my favorite soaps.\n\nI don't have a matching aftershave for Bali Hai, so I got creative and mixed YRP and QCV to achieve a closer match. YRP is too bright for BH, and QCV is too sweet, so I made a mashup FTMFW!!!!\n=)\n\nHappy hump day people!!!",

This was my first time using a Through the Fire Fine Craft soap. The soap was more cream like due to the sample size and the scent was pleasant and clean. The website notes describe this soap as clean, classic, blast of bergamot, geranium, lavender, cedarwood, and oak. The lather was slick and offered a decent amount of cushion. Where I thought it lacked was it's residual slickness as I felt almost none and did not attempt to touch up without reapplying lather. I'll continue to test the remainder of the sample and see if my initial impressions change.",

I know a lot of people in this sub love this scent, and for I'm happy to agree with that. I personally prefer Nocturne, but this scent is definitely very good and somewhat unique. It has a leather up front, with a coffee scent following that, and then a little sweet back at the back probably from the sandalwood. It's definitely a great fall scent to use when the weather gets cool.\n\nFor performance, B&M again is great. The glissant base is easy to use and produces a great lather. Today's shave was nice, especially on this cold rainy morning. I followed it up with the matching aftershave sample which left my face feeling great. Good shave today.\n\nHappy Thursday everyone. Have a great day!",

My proraso lives to fight another day, but at this point I need to treat it as a sample and load it in my lather bowl for tomorrow; I was finding large chunks of soap caught up in the lather.\n\nGood shaving, guys.\n\n",

This was on purpose, as the actual soap that rhymes with Fight Music is one of my least favorite smells in wetshaving (still love ya Will). By contrast Barrbarr is one of my favorites. Super fatty feeling from the soap, which I love, and the powdery and creamy smell of Barrbarr is great. Almost Friday....",

So I didn't see today's theme before I shaved (yesterday evening) and went with The Trail because it was nice and cool out and The Trail fits perfectly with that to me. Haven't used it in like 2 months either, so it was time to bust it back out. I'm kinda bummed now, because I own and love a Night Music set. Dude below said the scent of strawberry anal sex isn't for him...and I lost it. Apparently the scent of strawberry anal sex is all good with me, hahaha.",

The credit goes to my wife for that as she used most of it. So needless to say, it wasn't an option today.\n\nAbout a month or so ago, I was perusing TDR's site and saw the pre-order for this set and it kind of piqued my interest, so I thought what the hell. It was one of those impulse buys. I'm sure you can all relate. Anyway, it came in yesterday so I gave it a whirl this AM. The profile is coffee, cedar and black pepper and it smells fantastic. My only complaint is that the soap and splash kinda smell like 2 different scents in a way. In the soap there's something sweet in there that I'm not sure where it comes from as the notes suggest that this would be a pretty \"dry\" type of scent. The splash is way more coffee forward with the wood and spice following close behind. All in all, I love the performance of Oleo stuff and I had a great shave. Pleased with the purchase so far. Almost to the weekend y'all, happy shaves!",

Now, if you think Ditryver is dirty, ya'll gotta try Catie's Bubbles 322 and Eufros Vetiver de Haiti. That's where you get peak FUNKness",

      "body": "Thursday SOTD 9/27\n\n* Theme: Looked for Strike Gold's Faded Teen Movie Stars' line iconic \"Quite Cusack\" soap but couldn't find it. Next I tracked down Wholly Kaw's experimental \"Bright Acoustic Concerto\" cream, but the darn cat had eaten most of it. This left me only with \"Night Music\" to use...\n\n* Razor: Shave HQ's fine item, a 40s era GEM Bullet Tip (aka Flying Wing),\n* Blade; GEM Personna PTFE (6)\n* Soap: B&M Night Music (Glissant)\n* Brush: 30mm Dogwood Aurora w Tuxedo synth\n* Post: Duke Cannon Ice Cold Balm\n* Frag: L'Instant de Guerlain EDT\n\n* Product Notes:\n\n* Razor / Blade: I used the \"Magic Eye\" on the Flying Wing, which produced the exact same angle I normally use with GEMs. It's amazing what an excellent high quality shave a 70 year old GEM can produce, and with a comparatively minimal learning curve. Thanks /u/fuckchalzone for guidance and some free blades! Highly recommend vintage shoppers check out Shave HQ but bear in mind Fuck has a lot of inventory that is unlisted, so ask for what you may want.\n\n* Cartridge razor users seeking to convert may well be better off with a GEM - no blade choice and one easy to find angle makes the switch easy, as long as you are using a reasonably moderate razor, of which there are many in GEM land. (My own Bullet Tip and Pushbutton, and the 1912 loaner from /u/Old_Hiker are all mellow yet efficient.)\n\n* Soap: The smell brought back memories! Glissant was ok, pales for me in comparison to Reserve and Purple Possum. Shaves well enough, but needs close coupling with an effective balm to avoid Persistent Sore Face Syndrome.\n\n* Balm: The Duke is such an effective balm - beautiful menthol blast followed by immense soothing and long term moisture.\n\n* Frag: Matches well with NM - spicy and sweet.",

I forgot again to replace the blade in my main razor so I reached for the Mamba knowing I had put a new blade in it and only used that one 2-3 times. It's as smooth and mild as I remember and also took an extra pass because it's not quite as efficient. Not that I think that is necessarily a bad thing, the extra pass is just as enjoyable.",

      "body": "*Razor*: **Wolfman - WR1 Open Comb** Standard Gap Polished\n*Blade*: **Gillette - Nacet** (55)\n*Lather*: **Dr Jon's - Defiance**\n*Brush*: **Semogue - 2-band Badger in Cherry**\n*Post*: Dr Jons Blood Oath After Shave Lotion/Splash\n\n----\n\n[Video](https://youtu.be/Rfjl2Lt7u54)\n\n*Some Thursday I'll remember to look at the Theme and see if I can find something that matches. I do have Night Music, and like it. So that would have been a good shave, too. But, until then...*\n\n## General Notes / Exec Summary / TL;DR\nTried out an open comb Wolfman today and the SOC Badger brush I've been eyeing for a while.\n\nAnd because I finally watched Patton (1970) for the first time, I whipped out Defiance from Dr Jon's Cold War series!\n\n*(and yes, I know they were from different wars)*\n\n## Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Wolfman - WR1 OC with Gillette - Nacet ‹55 uses›)*\n\nFirst time with this head, and it went okay. Wasn't a good comparison due to the older blade. But it shaved well, though not as comfortable as the solid bar head I have that is a little more aggressive.\n\nAt some point, I'll throw a newer blade in it and I'm sure it'll be great.\n\nIt was great on the 2nd and 3rd passes though.\n\nI sure do like the look of the open comb for this head.\n\nThe blade is still doing well. I got a very close shave today with no irritation! It did pull a little bit, but that was on the first pass, and it was a shave on a 2-day growth.\n\n## Soap Notes\n*^(Dr Jon's - Defiance)*\n\nIf there weren't already tons of great soaps out there, then what I'd do with this scent is to play around with it and add in some soap from a really sweet or mellow profile. Some just Orange, or Almond. Just to round out and soften the pepper and allspice.\n\nBut... that's just not where we are, and there are just so many options. So this guy will go in the to-sell bin.\n\nThe base notes in the Cold War series by Dr Jon are sandalwood and mandarin. The latter of which I think I could detect, but any sandalwood that might be in there is absorbed into the pepper and allspice.\n\nPerformance, as usual, was excellent from Dr Jon's.\n\nOh, and I liked the artwork on this one, too.\n\n\n## Brush Notes\n*^(Semogue - Badger)*\n\nFirst time in a real shave with this brush. Tips weren't all that enjoyable while in splay, and it does have a med to med-high level of backbone. I don't think I mind this level of backbone, actually. Because this one did splay easily enough. It's just the tips. I hope they get a little softer with use. But this is a used brush, so we'll see how much it changes.\n\n## Shave Quality\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Few hairs are showing some tip length (with most being cut flush)\n\n----\n\n# Ending of Blades Ledger\n\nUse this to document how long our blades last, if you want, and what about them made us pitch 'em. I created a Google Form with just a few questions:\n\n[Ending of Blades Ledger](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform)\n\n[The Ledger Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing) in case you want to just look at the data.\n\nI'll keep this as my footer each SOTD so you have the link. I'll take it down if no one shows interest.",

I love promises. Out of all the B&M winter scents from last year, this was definitely my favorite. It was offered last year for the winter season and I grabbed both the soap and aftershave which I am glad I did. Unlike most other soap/AS combos, Promises offers a somewhat different or unique smell to each one. Both together do something awesome for me. I live and grew up in the northeast, so I was looking forward to this scent as it was based off of the scent from that and it nailed it. It gives off a cold smell but offers some background warmth from the whiskey note. It's a somewhat complex scent to describe, but it really does invoke snow and winter to me from being home for the holidays. The aftershave matches nicely to the soap, but isn't the same scent. It is a little warmer then the soap, and is a nice finish like you are going in to relax by the fire. I know that some people here thought this combo smelled like rubber to them, but I never really got that myself. I would highly recommend it to anyone and I hope it comes back as I didn't buy a full sized set at the time.\n\nAs I've said before, Barrister and Mann's performance is great and this is no different. This glissant base soap lathers easily and stayed great throughout the shave. Had an amazing shave today and it's a great way to start off the last day of the work week.\n\nHappy Friday everyone! Have an awesome day.",

The soap is definitely a top performer. Although I like that the balm absorbs quickly, it leaves my face feeling a bit dry afterwards and not as moisturized as what I usually like. This is also my first fougère scent. I do enjoy it, but it's more floral than I expected. I guess I was hoping for a forest type scent and this smells more like a flower bed to my amateur nose. Is this typical of fougères?\n\nCurious to hear others' thoughts on Eufros scents and fougères in general.\n\nTime to go show off my sexy smooth skin at my friend's new coffee shop.

My plan is to use up my set of Flowers in the Dark and then snag a set of Reserve Lavender. Definitely gotta keep the FITD EdT on hand though because this shit smells NICE. Performance on the soap is above average but not on the level of Reserve, so that's where that line of thinking comes into play. Oh well, I've got tons of time to think about it because I honestly can't justify another lavender scent like that without using this up first. Having to ensure I use the FITD more often isn't a bad thought to be honest. Happy Friday everyone!",

Most likely was back in the 70s, I think most men just bathed in this or *Old Spice*, *Aqua Velva* or *Brut*. It smells powdery with a little citrus maybe? I don't know. It smells better than I thought it would. Great Friday shaves to all.",

It's not offensive but I'm not sure I'll fall in love with it to the point I need it in my life. On the other hand, I want as much Icarus variety as I can get. Need to determine if this is one I'll reach for when the mood strikes or if it should go to the sell pile. Definitely a good scent and one I should check out a couple more times before deciding on. So glad it's Friday, I think we got another weekend with minimal to no things planned!",

The Darkfall scent really masks any traces of the gaminess that was apparent in the summer scents. This is a very protective soap base that is great for those of us with sensitive skin. This latest batch of releases has converted me...I'm definitely buying one of the sets in the Icarus soap base.",

This thing has got blade feel for days. A light touch is definitely a must with it unless you enjoy post shave irritation. Speaking of which, something in this splash burns the fuck out of my face for about 30 seconds after applying it. It feels and smells great when it subsides though. It's Friday bitches!

I typically only shave every other day since my hair grows pretty slowly-but by the middle of Day 2 the 5 o'clock shadow begins to show. So I started thinking, what would happen if I shaved with one WTG pass on off days?\n\nIt will be interesting to see how I feel about this by the end of the day. The shave itself felt like it did very little, and I could feel the blade on my skin in a more pronounced way than when I do my normal every other day shaves. I don't see any increased irritation right now, but I'll have to watch it over the course of the day.\n\nIt also didn't seem to do very much for the hair that's there. I guess it's because the pass was WTG, but I feel like the hair reduction was minimal. Not sure if I'll repeat this experiment.",

It was also my first time with R41 and it worked great. The shave got closer without any effort.\n\nAnd yes, the Arko smells a bit like a urinal puck, but I'm getting some cologneish? notes?\n\nAll in all, a great shave!",

After the XTG, I was at overall DFS with a few spots of BBS. Also, I only caught one weeper. Still, a little afraid to push an ATG pass with that beast.\n\nThe DdT is one of the last items in the Big Box of Rare Samples that I wanted to try. Off the puck, my first impression was Sprite. Like the Sprite I used to get when I was a kid at the swimming pool in the summer. This soap gave me a nose full of bright green citrus and tickling bubbles. In the lather bowl, some of the other notes started to come out adding a bit of floral to the green citrus. Overall, I really enjoyed the smell on this one and the FitD pairs very nicely.\n\nOnly one meeting today. Also, I just got an email from my manager that my team may have broken something.

I apparently am not as sensitive to blade chatter as many, and so can honestly say most of my SE shaves were pretty similar to most of my DE shaves.\n\n* More interestingly, SE blade life also did not astound me. ACs seem to be good for about 7 to 8 shaves for me, GEMs a bit longer, maybe around 10. (No idea for injectors, as I got bored with them before the blade died - certainly at least 6 - 7.) I was thinking 20 shaves or so for an SE, but this seems like optimism, at least with my usage and expectations.\n\n* So using AC as an example, there is no real cost savings for me. The cheapest useful blade is a Feather Pro from Amazon, at about fifty cents per blade. So after 8 shaves, I've paid a bit over six cents per shave. Comparing this to my usual 6 shaves on a 17 cent Bolzano, I'm paying about twice as much for an SE shave. As mentioned, the shave quality (face feel and BBS duration) does not seem utterly wonderful every time, or at least not head and shoulders above a DE shave.\n\n* GEMs are somewhat of a better bargain at two cents or so per shave, and also are more fun to shave with as the GEM blade and razor combo demands a much different angle, and it's kind of fun to shave with really old razors, which is usually what one ends up doing when using GEMs. The AC razors I have are all quite new and for the most part shave very similarly to DE razors, so part of the appeal of GEM is in the relative novelty and retro appeal.\n\n* Injectors? Meh. I only used the Supply razor on medium plate, and it was OK at best. The blades and shave did not impress me much, so I did not pursue vintage options. As a competitor to cartridge shaving, the Supply is adequate for those who don't want all the baffling choices that DE shaving offers, and for those who don't want to buy a vintage GEM (which is actually, I would argue, an even better choice to \"convert\" cartridge users.)\n\n* So end of the day - I miss many of my DE razors and look forward to meeting them again soon, but I had fun with AC and GEM razors, and met many excellent fans of the GEM system who were generous with blades, loaners, and guidance. Thanks again /u/fuckchalzone and /u/old_hiker!\n\n* I will continue to mix AC and GEM razors into the monthly mix, and would suggest that everyone try a GEM sometime soon!",

So, yesterday I went with the Truefitt & Hill 1805, and today I went with arguably the best product in my collection with the Seville In Reserve. Nothing new to report on it that hasn't already been said countless times here.\n\nWhile in Vegas my dad had told me about a friend of his that is a big wet shaver (and may even be on this board) who used to use double-edge but had gotten more into straight razors recently, and that he loaned my dad an Above the Tie M2 razor. So, I gave it a shot with a Derby blade that I had brought with me. That M2 razor is huge, heavy and aggressive! Derby's are usually not aggressive enough for me in my R89, but in the M2 that thing knicked me up like crazy. Granted, shifting razors like that will really test your technique, and mine was not up to par for it. I liked the M2's size and the stippling that provided a much better grip than the R89, so I'll eventually be on the lookout for another razor that comes close to it (maybe a different AtT model), but the M2 was too aggressive for me.\n\nAlso of note, my order of B&M Hallows is on it's way and should arrive on Monday.",

And I discover why people love Darkfall!\n\n## Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Karve Bradley with Gillette - Nacet ‹56 uses›)*\n\nSo... the shocker here is that the E plate, for the Bradley, worked really well for me. Why shocking? Because when I used it with a newer blade, it was unusably rough and aggressive. I put it away a month or two ago, wondering if I'd ever use it. But the 56-use Nacet, and probably many other age-smoothed blades, was a perfect fit!\n\nOnly a minuscule amount of irritation, and a very nice shave, with very good results.\n\n## Soap Notes\n*^(L&L - Darkfall)*\n\nI finally got around to trying this soap!\n\nThe Bison is a great base. Nice sheen, very slick, medium cushion (the way I mix it at least), protective, and providing the razor with great glide.\n\n1/4 tsp of soap with 3.25 tsp of water ... gave me a lather I like, and is about the right quantity for my usual 3.5 passes, with a little margin to spare.\n\nThis scent is awesome. Another one in which I had read the comments from folks and thought it wasn't for me. But it sure is. It loses some pungency between dry in the tub and lathered, but still very nice.\n\nScent strength, the only down side, was about 3-4 out of 10. Lower than I would like, but strong enough to keep me from selling it.\n\n\n## Brush Notes\n*^(Romero - Manchurian 26mm)*\n\nWell, I read that Romero brushes can be inconsistent. But this one is on point! Felt very nice. Not as much backbone as my Decl B5, which I'm glad about. But the B5 is new, so I'm hoping it relaxes in a similar way.\n\nTips were very soft, competing with The Declaration B5. Backbone... I might rate at a 6-7 out of 10. I think I'm discovering that I like that range, if it splays easily enough.\n\n## Shave Quality\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Few hairs are showing some tip length (with most being cut flush)\n\n----\n\n# Ending of Blades Ledger\n\nUse this to document how long our blades last, if you want, and what about them made us pitch 'em. I created a Google Form with just a few questions:\n\n[Ending of Blades Ledger](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform)\n\n[The Ledger Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing) in case you want to just look at the data.\n\nI'll keep this as my footer each SOTD so you have the link. I'll take it down if no one shows interest.",

It was actually also my first time trying the Icarus base and I was very impressed. I had no trouble lathering it and I have to say it was one of the most voluminous lathers I've ever had. It seems like it just kept coming and coming (yep). The B6 is a fucking outstanding product and probably my 2nd favorite batch after B5. I am very very excited to get Lamplight in the Icarus base after trying it today!",

It says 'Best', but in all my research it shows that it's actually 2 Band Super. According to my research, it was Mark Waterson's fathers idea to use the 2 band super in the Best-labeled handles to get product out, and that makes sense. The handle itself is Carter era, so it's a slightly different shape than current Chubby 3 handles, it's slightly curvier. I much prefer this shape than the current shape. The knot is slightly slimmer, and that's ok. I've had it for quite a while, and this is the second time I've used it. I'm convinced I'm the first one to use it. It shows NO signs of use. There are no markings anywhere on it form normal use, and the hairs are still so very straight, no flagging, and it feels like a new brush. Who knows, I like it regardless =)\n\nDFS, and I couldn't ask for more!\n\nHope everyone's day is going well!",

No clue how long the blade has been in there, but it still felt reasonably sharp.\n\nSoap, splash, brush, and scent we're all borrowed from my dad. Love the scent, and T+S has a great base. I have to say that this was a good reminder of why I have the routine that I do. I definitely missed my Coral Skin Food as a pre-shave and my Alum Block and Stirling Balm after the shave.\n\nHappy Saturday, all! Enjoy the weekend (and Go Blue!!)",

I purposely waited until today to shave with it because I'll be around her all day and maybe she'll wanna get a bit closer to me as the day progresses!

Really enjoyed it. Great to get back to the sweet performance of this soap! And revisited my most aggressive razor to try out Old Nacet.\n\n## Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Blackland Blackbird with Gillette - Nacet ‹57 uses›)*\n\nRazor was a little kinder to my skin with this smoother blade in it than usual. Got a great result from it. A little bit of irritation, but gone quickly.\n\n## Soap Notes\n*^(Fine - Fresh Vetiver)*\n\n30 seconds of loading from a soaked puck + 3.5 tsp water = amazing lather. So good! Had 2 passes left over, so will have to adjust.\n\nNext time maybe a 20 sec load. *This was also with a pretty stiff brush, so you may need to compensate for that.*\n\nSuch a great creamy, ultra-slick lather with that understated vetiver scent. I like it. One of the few weaker scents I'll keep around. So good. The performance of this soap really rivals anything out there, almost. I think it's pretty underrated.\n\nThis kind of performance, in a long-lasting hard soap makes me want to buy up his whole line!\n\n\n## Brush Notes\n*^(Semogue - Badger)*\n\ntips were a little nicer today. Backbone still there. But usable. not really comfy, and could irritate skin if an aggressive shave was had. Hope it softens up.\n\n## Shave Quality\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: A little irritating\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Cut flush to where I just see the tips (above average for me)\n\n----\n\n# Ending of Blades Ledger\n\nUse this to document how long our blades last, if you want, and what about them made us pitch 'em. I created a Google Form with just a few questions:\n\n[Ending of Blades Ledger](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform)\n\n[The Ledger Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing) in case you want to just look at the data.\n\nI'll keep this as my footer each SOTD so you have the link. I'll take it down if no one shows interest.",

I love synthetic brushes as they are generally very user friendly lather monsters. This knot (I believe 22mm) is a couple of mm smaller than either of my other brushes, which made it feel a bit more nimble on my face, without noticeably detracting from the lather the brush could hold (I had my usual 3 pass shave with lather left to have on my face during cleanup).\n\nThis is my first brush with a longer handle (my other brushes are short and squat), and it felt really good in my hand.\n\nIn conclusion, a big thumbs up on the brush.\n\nThe Holy Black's soap base is still nice, but not top tier.

This was another winter release from last year. Eventide to me has a strong oud forward scent. I really wish I could detect more raspberry and rose in it then I do. It is there, the oud just kinda clouds it up. Overall not a bad scent, but if you do not like the smell of oud I would steer clear.\n\nThe performance was great which is typical of B&M. It was easy to whip up a lather, and the lather offered great protection and slickness for the entirety of the shave. I followed it up with the matching Eventide aftershave sample which left my face feeling great.\n\nHave a great Saturday everyone! I'm off to a brewery on this beautiful day.",

Glühwein is German mulled wine. You take red wine and heat it in a pot with spices (cinnamon, clove, star anise, citrus, and sugar) and then you drink it nice and hot. It's great for warming you up on a cold fall or winter day. I first encountered Glühwein back in 1992 when my high school choir took a summer trip to Germany, Switzerland, Austria, and assorted other countries in the neighborhood. Basically every adult chaperone on the trip (including my mother) fell in love with Glühwein. Glühwein was all the rage in my small town the following winter. The soap is a nice take on the mulling spices with a bit of orange.",

It's a perfect day for another use of Nocturne but I couldn't pass up the opportunity to try one of my new goodies from CL. The shave itself was just okay. Barbershop performed well, but it's hard to convey just how much better my daily driver brush, the Stirling two band synthetic, performs than this Omega boar.\n\nThe reason I pivoted off Nocturne, however, was to use this La Foret de Liguest toner. It's heavily moisturizing and alcohol free, and the scent is deep, woodsy, and green in the best way possible. There's a hint of floral sweetness that sits atop the rest of the scent. I have a feeling that I'll be ordering a lot more of these toners very, very soon, especially since I caved on the Maggard's Edge $9 membership deal yesterday.\n\nHappy Saturday, all.",

My daily drivers, my Karve and my Dogclaration, were packed in my actual dopp so I went with my back up razor, the super adjustable, which gives a great shave still. I could easily use this as a daily driver if I had to. I didn't want to bring too many cylindrical splashes so I used Reserve Lavender as my good bye shave. I'm going to miss my SOC Boar but not as much as I'll miss my fam. Anyways, have a good weekend!",

Rec'd the CL splash Friday. It seems very musky/animalistic at first, but is growing on me and I can see how it is well-suited to the fall season. I don't have anything else that smells quite like it, so it makes for a nice diversifier to my den.",

The soap still works fine but it is getting to cold and windy. Thought i could take more of it. But no. Time for Nivea aftershave balm (no cooling version) for a while. But i so much like my proraso soap! And for 55 sek ( ~5-6 usd) so good price.\n\nWas going to go with my 16 month old son to church, but my wife managed to take both keys to the car with her when she went to work. So he got to join me for a shave instead. Instead of filling the sink with water it was running this time so he played with the water and i shaved. He seems to like shaving time with dad. And he got annoyed when i used the splash on me, but got happy when i \"clapped\"(?) It on him to just like i did on myself. Gotta start teach wetshaving early.",

But they're being cut well enough that it's not an uncomfortable pulling at all. So the 58 use old blade now continues on. The 2-3 passes feel like a normal shave and are enjoyable.\n\nAnd I'm continuing to like this razor a lot. Thanks to this old blade.\n\n## Soap Notes\n*^(T&H - Luxury Soap)*\n\nI think about a minute load with a damp brush, with just a little water thrown in, was the right amount of soap. And I think it was 3.25 tsp of water that was what put it at the right density for me. Pretty slick, and somewhat creamy. It was a workable lather, but nothing to write home about. There are so many other artisans that are just as good or better.... for a lot less money. And not just the $20 soaps, but there are some $10 and $12 soaps that beat it as well. I couldn't quickly find a price on this 57g size, but I'd rate this as a $10 product, based on performance. The 99 g goes for about $48, and I just don't see it as worth it when there is so much better out there.\n\nT&H is one of the Brit companies that have outsourced their hard soap making to end up with a lower quality product. Trumpers and TOBS are the other two. Creams are still made as in the past, but hard soaps have taken a downturn from these companies.\n\nAnd the scent, was like a very light Mitchell's Wool Fat. A linen-like scent. During the shave, almost unnoticeable.\n\n\n## Brush Notes\n*^(Declaration - B5 Rubr)*\n\nKnot felt good today. Seemed to work well and splay enough to get the job done. I don't remember any discomfort due to the density.\n\n## Shave Quality\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Few hairs are showing some tip length (with most being cut flush)\n\n----\n\n# Ending of Blades Ledger\n\nUse this to document how long our blades last, if you want, and what about them made us pitch 'em. I created a Google Form with just a few questions:\n\n[Ending of Blades Ledger](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform)\n\n[The Ledger Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing) in case you want to just look at the data.\n\nI'll keep this as my footer each SOTD so you have the link. I'll take it down if no one shows interest.",

Somewhere along the way, I bought a lot off the bazaar that came with this sample of Cuir et Epices. It's a wonderful spicy leather scent and because of this sample (and the fact that it was nearly gone), I picked up a full tub last weekend while ordering my Darkfall Icarus. Tub (and splash) secured, I no longer had to fear the end of this sample.\n\nIt's been a fun month and I've really enjoyed having the Big Box of Rare Samples. It was nice to smell and shave with Bufflehead (finally) to kick the FOMO. I think my favorite scent in the whole box was the B&M DFS exclusive, but the Delor de Treget was up there, too. And now that Sample September is ending, I'll need to scoop a few of my own harder-to-get soaps to add to the Big Box before sending it on to a new home.\n\nAs for today's shave, I decided to let the Wolfie run and do my usual head shave routine: one pass across the grain and one pass against the grain. My dome is now BBS, perhaps the closest shave I've ever gotten. However, I did pay a blood price. Three full-fledged nicks (all in the usual trouble spots) and a few weepers. I may have to face the fact that this Wolfman is just a bit too much razor for me. I'll give it a few shaves with different blades (maybe Personna and Polsilver) this week, but I don't think I'm going to have too much heartache when it's time to send it back to its home. Though it is a gorgeous piece of craftsmanship.",

I do really like this scent, it's nice dark without being too overpowering. I want to thank /u/spazztik88 for doing Sample September. Over the month I've tried 24 new soaps, some which I've liked and others I'll take a pass on.",

I switched up the way I shave my neck today and I think it really helped out. The grain on my neck is crazy and it almost always made shaving my neck a bitch. It's amazing just how well this worked.\n\nHaven't talked about the Slim yet. I dig it. I first used it earlier this week. I think the balance on it is a little head-heavy, but it works really well for me. The head geometry works better for my face than the Fat boy, but I think I prefer the handle on the Fat boy and think it's slightly better balanced.\n\nHope everyone has a great Sunday!",

This scent really does nail the name in my opinion. Upon smelling it for the first time, I easily was put into a holiday mood, and the scent reminded me of all the smells you get around Christmas time. It starts off with the scent of a Christmas tree, like fir or pine. Then it sweetens and spices up a bit with some vanilla, cranberry, cinnamon, and nutmeg. I believe there are other scent notes too, but those are the main ones I get. All together, the scent is a somewhat sweet, intricate, Christmas-y scent that would absolutely invoke memories of Christmas Eve for anyone. After my shave today, and I patiently awaiting the holidays.\n\nFor performance, Stirling products are super easy to use, have a great bang for your buck, and produce a very nice lather. I loaded up enough today on the brush and then went to work slowly adding water until a great lather exploded. Had a nice three pass shave and left my face feeling great so I didn't feel the need for the aftershave.\n\nThis has been a fun sample month for me, and I hope everyone that also participated enjoyed it like I did. Thanks to everyone who read my daily SOTD posts. I tried to do the best I could to explain what the scent and soap offered for those who had never tried it, and hopefully that all made sense. Again, thanks for the read\n\nHave an enjoyable and relaxing Sunday everyone!",

The sweetness on Lavanille is dying down and more of the mousse de saxe is coming forward which is very pleasant. I just needed to switch up something in the shave as it was getting a little repetitive.\n\nBad News: It's been about a year that my grandfather has been in and out of the hospital for stuff. He finally passed and his funeral is this week. Hopefully it is the last time for a while going home for a funeral. Work has been brutal as it appears our group has zero direction. It really does feel like a grind right now. Also, gosh darn you Penn State football.\n\nGood news: Always need to stay positive in tough times. I am really enjoying the fall weather. I am glad that it has finally cooled off. It makes it so easy to stay inside and be cozy for the entire day. Things around the house are coming along. We are missing our area rug to really pull in our family room and now we have started furniture shopping for our dining room. I have also found trying to restore the lawn very enjoyable.",

      "body": "**Sample September 30** - Fall/Winter Week\n\nI finished Sample September with some great products. Excited to try /u/phteven_j and Southern Witchcraft's new base. This was a sample of Alchemist in the old base.\n\nI hope all the other participants enjoyed killing some samples. Fall is here and my tubs of soap are ready for the cooler half of the year here in California.\n\nI'm very pleased with the performance of the ATT R1. I've used a lot of new hardware lately and this has to be in the running for top razor. The Voskhod gets two uses per blade and pairs well with the razor.\n\nCompliments to Noble Otter on the release of Texaus! The Flying Otter Splash paired quite well with both the SW soaps I used yesterday and today. Finishing both with Encre Noire was clutch.\n\nLather: Southern Witchcraft Alchemist\n\nBrush: Dogwood Handcrafts \"Kamino\" 24 mm Tuxedo\n\nRazor: Above The Tie Atlas R1\n\nBlade: Voskhod\n\nPost: Noble Otter Flying Hide Splash\n\nFragrance: Encre Noire\n",

Of all the scent notes I primarily picked up on the rubbery scent of the Saffron which remained throughout the lather.\n\nWhile I didn't kill off any samples I enjoyed the month to finally try many of my samples and just about tried them all. The stand outs for me were Declaration's Shore as the Icarus base had fantastic post shave and Noble Otter for their wonderful scents and fantastic performance.",
