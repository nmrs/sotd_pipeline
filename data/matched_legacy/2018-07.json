Of course I forgot to use the preshave oil, turns out it really is an oil. And of course I missed out on the very important [playlist]( https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/8v74vm/canada_day_lather_games_music_playlist_very/). Alas, the whole house was asleep anyways. Really good lather, I am maintaining my sample lather stride and wait... that's it? Good job everyone who made it this far, and even for those who finished strong even if they did miss one.\nBetween u/raggedclaws departure and u/urfrendlipiro 's faith in the r/wetshaving community, the line for casualties for next year's Lathergames will start at +2.5.

The last day of lather games! It's been fun but crazy challenging to pair a tea with a soap everyday. It's been fun reading all the posts and shit posts. I hope this lives on next year.\n\nThis soap is one of my favorites. It doesn't get much love around here, but its top notch lather and I absolutely love the scent. It passes the wife test with flying colors as well. I'd totally order an EdP of this.\n\nThis is a tea grown in Canada on what is supposedly the only tea farm in Canada. This is a tea grown on an island in Vancouver on a tiny piece of land. They only have about 400 tea plants so this is a pretty unique tea. The price is pretty ridiculous so I only have 5 grams of this tea, this will be the only time I get to try it. I am pleasantly surprised with the roast level of the tea, I was afraid that it would be a very green oolong that dies out quickly, but I managed to squeeze out about 10 steeps of this tea. It's not as good as some middle of the road Taiwanese oolongs, but I'm really glad to have tried it.",

FU Canada. This soap was really great but the smell was not for me and definitely out of season. Too heavy on the smoke and cedar and I swear I detected maple syrup. In solidarity with /u/itchypooter and what he's having to go through today (and maybe too the guilt from my part in it), I decided to break out The Veg. Idk why this stuff was ever made. It smells like a diaper and it lit my face up. Oh well at least that's another Lather Games in the books and now it's onwards and upwards.

It smells really good! I don't really get much sandalwood from it--it's more of a clean, masculine cologne smell. Very nice.\n\nThis is the new triple milled base, which I understand is a bit of a misnomer. I'm still not quite sure, but I think it's not really milled in a traditional sense, but is more like melted to remove water. In any event, the performance was good. No issues really at all.\n\nWell, we're finally at the end. It's been fun, but I'm looking forward to walking up in the morning and choosing a soap that fits my mood. Special thanks to the Committee and those who have put in a lot of work to make this happen. I don't envy their job to pick winners at this point, but may the lather be in their favor.",

      "body": "Happy Birthday Canada!\n\nI don't usually post much of a write up and like to participate because I get to try new soaps and read other's people posts.\n\nThough this quasi, one foot in the pool, participation has made me feel like something was missing and it dawned on me that I hadn't yet felt the honour of being shit listed. So I thought short and hard, long and soft and tried more liquid brainstorming to come up with a way to have the honour of being shit listed.\n\nThe problem is that I couldn't think of anything, as I am not very original, don't have much in the way of talents, and couldn't tell a story if my life depended on it. So instead of an original story or a funny anecdote, I figured we could make a literal shit list on bonus shave day.\n\nFor all those wetshavers starting their day with a shit and a shave please reply or add your [Bristol Stool Type](https://www.gutsense.org/constipation/img/BSF-with-highlight.png) to your post today.\n\nAlso, thank you to all the people who have put in their own personal time to organize and run this event. It is much appreciated and makes June a month I look forward to each year.\n\nOh, I almost forgot.\n\n* Prep: Hot Shower\n* Brush: Dogwood Handcrafts Aurora\n* **Lather:** Tallow + Steel 150\n* Razor: EJ DE89\n* Blade: Wilkinson Sword\n* Post: Stirling Frozen Tundra\n* Bristol Stool Type: 5",

It has a very narrow tolerance for water and it burns my face a little. I was able to counter its disdain for water by loading at least twice as much product, maybe three times as much, as I do most other soaps. There isn't anything I can do about the burning though, but it really isn't too bad. Just a tad uncomfortable. So why do I keep it? Simple. It is the best tobacco scent I own. Period. I love this stuff.\n\nI am sooooo glad the games are over. They are fun for about a week, then I feel constrained. Now I can get back to agonizing over which soap to use on any given day. I am considering doing a little bit of sample slaying this month. I have probably 6 motnths worth, or more, of samples.\n\nOut into the heat I go to do yard work.",

I wanted to keep it as Canadian as possible, so I broke out the Rockwell razor for this one.\n\nI chose T+S Himalaya over Maya for one simple reason: scent. Himalaya has a spicy sweet scent. It's certainly unique. It isn't a scent for me, but Maya...well let's just say it's *very* unique. Maya makes me think of waking up after a night of drinking by the campfire and deciding to chew on one of the leftover now charcoal crusted sticks from the fire: damp, smokey, and a bad idea.\n\nHimalaya, on the other hand, is spicey but not like KFC Nashville Hot Chicken spicey. It's more of an aroma of walking around in an ethnic open air market. It has a bit of sweetness to it as well, but that's ever so slight.\n\nAnyway, it's been a heck of a ride.

I don't know much about triple milling process, but I am inclined to say, based on my other triple milled soaps, if this is triple milled, I am LeBron James. I could be wrong, as I often am.\n\nWhile not difficult, it does take some effort to build a good, hydrated lather. I got an almost-dripping wet lather at the end. I didn't feel any lack of slickness, the residual slickness was okay as well - maybe not the best? The lather stability was a little less than what I prefer - it became thinner than expected. But still not bad. And the scent - man this scent is dope. I would say this is an excellent sandalwood based scent made for shaving soap - you get the shaving soap vibe in the scent if that makes any sense.\n\nThe aftershave, CnCC, has nothing in common with the soap (Duc de Santal) other than the maker, but this is all I had from HeV/Canada. It is a truly wonderful scent, but I think, as an ex-chain smoker, I should avoid it. Temptation is a bad thing.\n\nIt has been a fun month (+2 days). But I am kinda glad that it's over. Fuk Rules.\n\n**EDIT** **after 2 Hours: The aftershave smells exactly like ashtray now. Have to take a shower.**",

Today's shave wasn't terribly great and I added to much water, but it some ways it was glorious because it means I made it to the end. Some things I learned this month: my face isn't as sensitive as I've always thought (or I'm better at shaving), two passes is plenty for most days, I don't have nearly enough brushes or aftershaves and I have far too many soaps. But whenever I think of this, my first Lather Games, there is no way I won't think about that fateful Wildcard Wednesday. The day when everything went off the rails. The day when grown men shaved with breast milk and vagisil. The day where the games were left dead to rights but like a phoenix, rose again to greatness. This has been fun. I'm glad it is over. Now I just have to figure out what to do with all of the shit that I have acquired over the last month. Thanks to everyone who made this happen. And thanks to this weird little corner of the internet where being obsessed over shaving is not only accepted, but embraced and encouraged. See you all tomorrow on the regular SOTD threads. I never really participated in those before the games, but I will miss this so I will certainly participate going forward.\n\n32/32 days and unique soaps completed. Mission Accomplished.",

The Halifax farmer's market had some nice offerings, which I will be trying out in the future, but the Dartmouth farmer's market is only a quick ferry ride away so I thought I'd check that too. I scoped out [Westwood Natural's](https://www.westwoodnaturals.ca) shave soaps online before heading over and saw that their soaps had lanolin and shea butter in the ingredients list. Very interesting... They even have one with goat's milk kefir which I will test soon. Also, the soaps are made in Canada (Halifax, Nova Scotia) so they qualify for today. Just wanted to make that clear haha\n\n\nThe soap comes wrapped in a small cloth so you need to supply your own bowl or something similar. It has a very nice consistency pre lather and it wipped up a thick, glossy lather. The shave was great as well. Tons of cushion and residual slickness and it was so easy to get a thick and protective layer of soap on the face. I think I'm going to try my hand at a review of this soap soon but my first impression would be to rank it up there with B&M Glissant base. It's not Reserve or Declaration Bison but it's pretty damn good. It would need a bit more glide to get top marks but perhaps that's because there's no tallow in this base.\n\nAnyways, after I picked up the soaps (and their frankincense aftershave) I saw another vendor (Seaside organics) at the market selling lavender toner. It smelled good, it was called a toner, so bought it and used it today, but it was not what my skin needed so I'll be leaving it behind after my trip is over.\n\n\nAll in all though I'm very happy with my all Canadian shave today. I learned a lot about wet shaving and got to know the other wet shavers on the sub a bit more and it turns out you guys are pretty cool. Congrats to everyone that participated in the games and many thanks to the organizers!

      "body": "[Canada 🇨🇦 Day](https://imgur.com/gallery/59ACTpb)\n\nBetween listening to Hotline Bling and Despacito yesterday, I had a tough decision to make regarding my representation for Canada Day. I had originally planned to use Elvado Pacific Coast Kahuna (a new soap I'd meant to try, bought for the games, is summer appropriate, and a vegan base) all things that are important to me. But thanks to the generosity of /u/EavestheGiant and by extension the r/wetshaving community I was pifed Tallow + Steel Maya (a soap I didn't intend to buy myself, that's not *as* summer appropriate, and is a tallow base).\n\nI ended up using .choose in IRC and gonzobot made the absolute right decision. On a day like today, the last day of the Lather Games, I'll celebrate Canada Day with a soap that, to me, represents the best of this sub: inappropriate, totally unnecessary, and favors animal products and by-products - **Tallow + Steel Maya**\n\nQuick explanation of self here. I'm pretty much a newb here, although I hope these Lather Games have truly \"broken the seal\" for me [RIP Ragged's seal references]. It was really nice to have a brief discussion about tallow vs. vegan with /u/C_Bubbles yesterday. He provided a [very logical](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/8v0goo/lather_games_sotd_thread_caturday_jun_30_2018/e1klvbe) explanation as to why tallow bases tend to be favored, and it's not without reason (as I had previously believed). But good soap makers like Barrister & Mann, Catie's Bubbles and Wholly Kaw have proven that great soap bases can be vegan and pretty much indistinguishable from their tallow counterparts. The same can't be said about brushes in my opinion (at least yet). For example, animal hair brushes truly perform very differently than synthetics. I have dedicated part of my lather games to explore these themes and and I'm excited at the prospect of expanding my exploration and sharing my thoughts with the sub.\n\nFinal thoughts and butterflies about the Lather games... It's crazy how I've gotten to speak with folks, learn, and develop relationships via r/wetshaving, and the Lather Games has been a true eye opener for me; I've shaved daily (something I've never done before), but will most certainly not refrain from doing in the future. For the most part (minus 2 days) I've had absolutely stellar results.\n\nSpecial thanks to /u/Fahrenheit915, /u/Dr_Facilier, /u/Phteven_j, and /u/pilgrim32 for making it possible for me to participate and complete all the days. Thanks /u/ItchyPooter for the inspiration to shitpost, and for roping me into IRC (which I'm also fairly new to).\n\n**Lather:** Tallow + Steel Maya\n\nBrush: Semogue 610 (first time boar brush use /u/old_hiker, /u/NexRenegade, /u/Cadinsor, the Zenith is on the way too)\n\nRazor: Karve \"D\" Plate on 3 inch Karve Handle\n\nBlade: Polsilver\n\nPost: Tallow + Steel Maya\n\nGreat performance all around - and a happy conclusion to the lather games!",

This has been an informative month as far as shaving goes. I've always been a daily shaver, but I tend to get stuck in ruts and use the same set rotations over and over again. My technique, already something I've been proud of has gotten much better. With the exception of truly shit soap, I can lather just about anything now. This month has introduced me to a variety of excellent artisans whose soaps I had never tried before (Maggards, Green Dragon, LASSCO, Noble Otter, Stubble Buster, Summer Break, Southern Witchcrafts, and First Canadian), as well as some things that I had fond memories of, that were summarily crushed (I'm looking at you Proraso).\n\nu/rocketk455, expect an order once I work my way through your massive samples. Brain Break is my favorite scent out of all of the new products I used this past month.\n\nShoutout to u/chiseledface who sold me empty sample jars and sample aftershave containers so I could continue this while on vacation. I imagine I'll be back in before too long to buy more soap that I don't need.\n\nI now have my Icarus soap samples to work through before deciding which full size soap to pick up, as well as trying Oleo's duck fat base.\n\nIt's been fun.

Two tears in a bucket.\n\nToday's shave was the first use of the washroom at my new apartment (away from home, for work.) Kinda nice to have this silly online shaving thing for a bit of consistency.\n\nHow The Games went for me:\n\n- 32 shaves in 32 days\n- 32 different soap makers, plus CL collab and sub exclusive.\n- same witch hazel for post, and same hardware throughout, including 32 uses of the Rapira\n\nI got almost every artisan that i support into The Games, but missed using Bufflehead due to cross-boarder shipping of a gifted sample (thanks u/Nex_renegade!) I'll use it tomorrow. I also should've included a u/MrAdamLerner exclusive but i was already on the road when i thought of it.\n\nFor u/itchypooter, my contribution to the shit posting is spelled by the first letter of each of my posts to The Games, starting on May 31st.\n\n________\n\nSOTD 2018-07-01 - Lather Games Bonus - Oh Canada!\n\n**Lather:** Tallow + Steel Rainforest\n\nThe rest: Dogwood handcrafts custom w/ faux horse, Eriksson & Bjorklund No 3 5/8\", Gillette f-b Tech on Maggard MR1, Rapira Swedish Supersteel (use 32), Humphrey's Witch Hazel astringent.\n\nSpecial thanks to the powers that be (aka individuals volunteering their efforts) for administering The Games.",

      "body": "Razor: Gillette Rocket HD (UK)\nBlade: Derby Premium (1)\n**Lather:** Tallow + Steel Classic\nBrush: Whipped Dog Silvertip 22mm\nAS: Tallow + Steel Classic\n\n----\n\nWell, it's the end. My **first Lather Games**. It was fun having everyone be on the same page and reading about similar experiences or opinions about a product we were all using at the same time. I soak up info like a sponge and loved seeing what was really so many reviews all in one place ... as well as the awesome stories that so many of you took the time to put up (Thank you so much!).\n\nI'm also a creative writer, but one with two small kids, and who was traveling 2 weeks out of the Games, doing this on my mobile phone. So I wasn't really able to embellish my posts with much enjoyable material like some of you. So I stuck with more of a review-like format with maybe a story thrown in, a few times, when I was using an item with a lot of memory attached to it, or of some sort of significance to me.\n\nI tried a lot of **new blades** this month, and so now I guess I need to go back through my reviews and find the ones I wanted to give another go. And I'm going to hit that injector again; I can see how people like those, too.\n\nSo... I ended up making a [video of every shave but one](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzCk6w7aeOdF0Iya3j9NJb9KCmVJnSBJR). I put them all in one playlist, and I hope that the info is helpful to some folks out there.\n\n----\n\n[Picture](https://imgur.com/bOjtPuO) - [Video](https://youtu.be/N83CE0zsbzM)\n\nThe **lather** worked well, but next time instead of adding 4tsp of water, I'll try 3.5 and see if it's just as slick, but a bit more creamy with more cushion. The scent was great, a 5-6 out of 10 to me for strength (where I like it). A standard zesty orange scent, worthy of the name \"Classic\".\n\nThe **razor** is a delight to hold, and weighs and balances just like I prefer. Solid and very enjoyable. The geometry is like so many UK razors where they are efficient, while also being comfortable to use.\n\nThis **blade** ... Efficient, and not smooth on the first pass (but not rough either). First impression of this one is that it's not that much better than the Derby Extra. If the Premium is more expensive, it may not be worth the extra cost. I like the Extra, for a good budget blade. However, let's give the Premium a fair shake. It did well today and deserves a good sampling with other razors.\n\nThe **AS** is great for me. I really like T+S AS's. No sting of alcohol, but really nourishing for my face.\n\nThe **brush** is my favorite knot. Many think it is too floppy, but just right for me. Felt like puppy dogs, dipped in clouds.\n\n\n\nMetric | Stat\n---|---\nUnique Soap Makers | 32/32\nUnique Razors | 32/32\nUnique Blades | 32/32\nUnique Post Shave Scent | 32/32\nUnique Brushes | 17\nUnique [Shave Videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzCk6w7aeOdF0Iya3j9NJb9KCmVJnSBJR) | 31\nShaving Methods So Far | 4: DE, SE, Straight, Injector",

But now it feels [more like a face plant.](https://thumbs.gfycat.com/EmbarrassedDisloyalFallowdeer-max-1mb.gif)\n\nCanada Day at the end? Is that Canada getting shafted as usual? Or Canada being so polite it went to the end of the line? The world may never know.\n\nT&S Boreal was very Canadian. Like so many other things Canadian: bagged milk, \"kraft\" dinner, pouting, and that mutant version of football they play... they're not *bad*... just... weird.\n\nThanks to OG /u/aymanem ([of lil Ayman baby fame](https://youtu.be/BJSLHAi5C0A?t=9s)) I got to try a Declaration B1 today. I've never tried a Declaration broosh before. It's going to be an interesting week, since he sent me a B1, B4 and B5 to try.\n\nI mashed my T&S sample down in my bowl and got to work lathering. It looked great in the bowl, but things changed when I took it to my face.\n\nLathering with the B1 was like being with that beautiful girl freshman year of college. You're putting in the work, diligently working it, but she just keeps staring at the ceiling.\n\n\"Right there. Yep. Don't slow down, a little faster...\" she says. You try the alphabet, clockwise circles, counter clockwise circles, paint the fence, sand the deck...\nYour youthful enthusiasm wanes and is instead replaced by dogged determination.\n\nMore circles, more letters... this time the Greek alphabet... your mind wanders...*what comes after Upsilon... Phi or Chi?* but still nothing.\n\nYour reward for all this work is but a thin white coating on upon your chin and cheeks. Is it merely inexperience on your part? Maybe it's her fault? Maybe she's frigid.\n\nB1 is universally loved.\nAm I crazy? Or has everyone else lost thier mind?\n\nWhen faced with multiple competing hypothesis, I find it helpful to apply Arkam's Razor:\n\n>\"when faced with multiple options, bang them all before making a commitment.\"\n\nSo I'll have to use B1's sister's before coming to a conclusion. Perhaps even mash one on each cheek at the same time in a kinky brush 3-way that will raise more questions than it answers.\n\n\nYep... prolly gonna [get weird](http://7thengineers.net/Mitchem27-SavingCreamMan.jpg)\n________\n**Final Tally**\nDays completed: 32 of 32\nUnique soaps: 32\nUnique Artisans: 26\nUnique Razors used: 9\nUnique Brushes used: 5 + a hand/smear day",

I love the smell on this stuff (smells just like The Blades Grim \"Smolder\"... or maybe vice versa). However, it was a pain in the ass to try and lather since I didn't have access to a bowl for the sample. I ended up trying to scoop some of the soap into my hand and hand lather, but the soap wouldn't stay put so it wouldn't load and blah blah blah.\n\nI probably won't be posting any more SOTDs until I get back to the mainland in a week or so. I will be swinging by Island Naturals in Hilo when we get to the the Big Island because Al from the [Hawaiian Shaving Company](http://hawaiianshavingcompany.com/) says they sell his soaps. I'm thinking I may pick up an extra puck or two to PIF (or maybe for the newly announced Secret Santa) when I get home as my own way of thanking you fine folks for a very enjoyable 32 days of shavecraft.\n\nIn closing, I give you a photo of our Hawaiian alarm clock: [the rooster in the banana tree outside our bedroom window.](https://imgur.com/gallery/D1hdmmr)\n\nThing | Unique Things | Unique Thingmakers\n:-----|:-------------:|:------------------:\nSoaps | 32 | 22\nBrushes | 7 | 6\nRazors | 4 | 2\nBlades | 3 | 3",

I figured I'll pull this one out as I haven't used it in a long time. This stuff is solid, gets the job done no problem but for me I have better. But this one is a group exclusive and 8oz of soap so not going anywhere and will last forever.\n\nAlso fuck me it's a scorcher out here in Toronto inside my house it's 80F and I can't drink water fast enough.\n\nAlso this was fun for me starting last minute I made it through the whole later games without missing a day.",

Had a helluva time in a house on Lake Michigan. It was my first time in the lake despite living a mile from it, although [this beach](https://i.imgur.com/9DmUpLe.jpg ) was an hour and a half north in Wisconsin. First time using Cheshire. I wasn't expecting it to be so similar lathered up to Seville. That's not a complaint because Seville is my absolute favorite and Cheshire on the puck made me apprehensive. Great shave today. I think I'm the one guy that really enjoys shaving with a Wilkinson Sword, especially in my slant. No post shave lotion today, I let the residual soap soak in while I brushed my teeth and what not. My face feels great.",

I went searching for it in the Lather Games trade thread to no avail. As luck would have it (well, not \"luck\"...whatever the opposite of luck is), an eagle-eyed /u/whiskyey spotted a set atop the Maggard's PIF table, and hand delivered it into my care.\n\nI put a nose on it in Adrian, and I had the sneaking suspicion that, even in a month filled with some misses, I might be biting off more than I could chew with this.\n\nI've buried my face in some real dicey and questionable places over the years -- truly the Yeti Snot and Viking Revolution of bar room last call girlfriends. Plus, I figured Tabac and fish-assed Aether and Santa Fe Dragon's Blood and Smoky Mountain Rain would prepare me for anything. Even so, I wasn't ready.\n\nA lot of soaps and aftershaves mellow out as you use them. Sometimes the rough edges will get smoothed out, and it'll be just fine once it's on your face and turn into really something great a la Fougere Classique.\n\nAnd then there's West Coast IPA.\n\nIt smells bad in the tub and out of the bottle -- so bad, in fact, that I'm pretty sure something has spoiled or oxidized -- because 1.) this doesn't smell like any India Pale Ale that I'm familiar with and 2.) this isn't a smell that 3 or 4 people would've signed off on. I'm no soap chemist or a hops scientist or essential oil upline sales team leader. All I have is a highly suspect nose. And my nose tells me, and I quote, \"fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck.\"\n\nI was hanging poolside with my extended family, so I ducked in, took a shower, and tallied this last, most horrifying shave. And then after slapping on the aftershave, I came back downstairs and jumped right back in the pool, prayerfully, that the chlorine water would take the edge off.\n\n\"Didn't you just take a shower?\" they ask.\n\nI didn't answer. I just went to the bottom of the pool, sat on the floor, held my breath as long as I could, and hoped that by the time I surfaced, they would've forgotten the question and that I didn't answer it.\n\nBecause how do you explain this?\n\nAny of this?\n\nFor fuck's sake, these Lather Games have broken me.",

I've used this base several times, and I'm pretty familiar with how it behaves. The tester lathered easily, and was fairly similar to the current base. It's very slick, and the performance is already great. I think the tester wasn't quite as easy to lather, but it's hard to say after one use. The post shave feel was slightly improved, but not significantly to me. Overall, I'd say this tester isn't enough of an improvement to make the change, especially coupled with a possible reduction in ease of lathering.\n\nTomorrow, I shall wake up and choose the soap that fits my mood. And my mood has been telling me since the Maggard meet up that it will be Icarus Sweet Lemon. I can't wait!",

This soap was made for the PNW Wet Shavers Meetup from West of Olympia and was one of the extras that he sold that were not claimed during the meet up. It is a dead ringer for Polo Red and this base is phenomenal. It is easy to lather, super slick and a lot of cushion. This is the same base as the 7 Deadly Sin line (which I have yet to try). It is fantastic. You have to be kidding me with all of these awesome soaps out there right now. This stuff is killing my wallet. Although this one was only $6, so you can't beat that. It paired really well with the Red Eye splash from Stirling. All in all, a great shave.\n\n[WoA Polo Red](https://imgur.com/gallery/hjvjeim) bad photo of the day.",

Nice balance, impeccable fit and finish and very affordable.\n* Soap: My favorite of the Reserve line.\n* Blade: My first Bolzano - seems sharper than Astra and smoother. Potentially useful, as there are many blades sharper than Astra, but few that give smooth trouble free shaves even with first use. Will see how the Gertalian blade holds up with other less accommodating soaps. (I feel I could get a good shave with a butter knife if I used Reserve as the soap.)\n* Frag: Spicy, grassy incense. Inappropriate for 98 degree weather you say? Well, the mind can make a heaven out of hell, etc., and I think this scent works even in this broiling miasma. If coworkers and fellow subway riders keel over around me, I may reconsider.",

Bigelow Cream\n* Post: Nivea Sensitive Balm\n\nI was testing out my Austere August setup today. Not a bad shave! I've been rushed the past few mornings so I've used Barbasol and the canned foam version of C.F. Bigelow. After these, even a mediocre lathering cream is nice to use. I don't like menthol, and this cream isn't great, but I was able to get it to have good slickness and a nice sheen. It was a bit runny at this point, though. Overall, I'm trying to kill off this tube, so that's my motivation for using it in August.",

Such a strange and funny feeling. I stared at all my options for fully ten minutes. Scarcely able to believe that I, alone, could choose to use whatever soap I fancied. What a novel and queer idea! My hand trembled as I selected my tub of soap.\n\nCould this be real? Will it all evaporate in the fog of a dream? And I'll find myself staring into the endless spreadsheet from hell, dictating my soap choices for all of eternity...\n\nThe declaration knot experiment soldiers on. Today I used B4. The knot density over any other badger I've used, is the first thing I noticed. Much better lather than yesterday's B1. But that's very possibly just the difference between lathering a sample or a tub.\n\nDay 1 of vacation. Off to earn that extra $$$.\nLater taters.",

I absolutely love the Icarus base. Even in the hard water of where I currently am, I got an absolutely fantastic lather out of it.\n\nIn other news, I ordered a /u/G_Huck handle yesterday (a beautiful 24mm Sycamore) and will be sending it off to get a B5 knot once I get it. It will be my first larger size, proper Badger brush and I'm definitely excited for it.",

Yesterday I rated very high but I think I'm going to knock it down a notch or two. Everything about this soap feels very luxurious except for its glide. It makes my skin feel awesome but it's hard to get a close shave. It has a bunch of great ingredients: lanolin, shea butter, castor oil, clay, but it's missing something that gives a good shave... Maybe tallow? Still a very fun soap to use for a unique experience.\n\nI'm still out of town for work (which sucks!) so I'm not able to get to my favourite soaps yet. Tomorrow it's time for some travel sized wild west soap.",

If you haven't tried the Icarus base, do yourself a favor and buy a tub. I've not had another soap that was so nourishing to my face. I have very extremely sensitive, dry skin, and I honestly don't know that I even needed to use the splash afterwards. Just so freaking good. Y'all have a nice day.",

The soap, as many have already said is just amazing. It is top tier in every area, and the scent on this one is great. I really dig the lemon/coconut combo.\n\nThe brush was.....okay. The bristles are very long, and it's going to take some getting used to. It's extremely soft and felt great on my face, but I wonder if I'd prefer something not as floppy.\n\nThe razor was a loan from /u/Aymanem. The first two passes were wonderful for me. It's a very well-made razor that looks great and has a premium feel. The third atg pass was a bit dicey. It felt tuggy and not nearly as comfortable. I'll need more time with it, but so far it's good. I can see why people are giving his high marks. Especially if you're a two pass shaver--it's very efficient, and smooth on those two passes. I usually do 3 passes, so we'll see how things play out over the next few uses.",

When I was younger I used to stay at my aunt's house a lot and we would rent Hook from the library all of the time. It was one of those VHS tapes that as soon as it was done, I'd yank it out, throw it in the separate VHS rewinder, and start over right away.\n\nI was super weird, though. During the imaginary food fight scene when Peter slices the coconut Rufio throws at him in half, I fucking *loved* the [sound it made when it spun on the table](https://youtu.be/YCSbEzI7Nz0?t=56s). I would actually rewind and rewatch that one part over and over again just to hear the coconut spinning on the table.\n\nOverall, a very weird movie that was not received well when it came out, but it's up there for me with Labyrinth, Goonies, and Princess Bride as best childhood movie.\n\nOh yeah...the soap. Storybook's Hook smells almost *exactly* to me like Southern Witchcraft's new Arcane Abyss. I've got samples of both up to my nose, and while they're not 100% the same, they're pretty damn close. Hook is clearly very dirty and sea-based.\n\nAnd just like Arcane Abyss, I *want* to like it, and in some ways I really do, but it's just not quite hitting a [home run for me](https://youtu.be/atTA43Qsym4?t=2m47s), but it's still incredibly unique and intriguing.\n\nThe Storybook soap base is just phenomenal. Seriously one of my absolute favorites. For me, this stuff whips up the perfect lather in mere seconds. Everything about it from slickness to post-shave feel is just there and shines.",

The razor I used was a Red Tip I traded some soaps and aftershave for it on Shave Bazaar and this is the third shave in a row with a Voskhod and this Red Tip and the aggressiveness of the razor matched with the smoothness of the Voskhod is fantastic damn good shave, hope everybody is getting ready for the 4th have a nice rest of your Tuesday!",

It took no effort to make a lather and it spread across my cheeks like I was using lotion. The scent was also fantastic, like what I imagine the most honest soap made with the best ingredients smelled like. The Reserve Classic was also a great performer, my cheeks feel nice and smooth without feeling heavy which is a blessing in these 90+ degree days we've been having. I really can't describe the scent as anything other than classic. Like this is the scent that don draper would have used, clean, manly, and present but not overwhelming. A+++ shave, it's going to be hard to put the buffle back in the box.",

It's probably the smell plus appearance. Their website (this is a Maggard sample) says it's 60% wild orange. I'm not smelling it from the sample. I haven't lathered yet and I'm very apprehensive about this soap. Here goes nothing:\nOkay, so I still don't smell the orange. Maybe boiled peanuts. I don't like this. But the PERFORMANCE my gosh! I wouldn't hesitate to try T&S again, but big pass on this smell for me. 2nd and 3rd passes smelled like bay leaves.",

I suck at taking pretty pictures of shave gear but there's a pic of what it looks like up there 👆. It looks waaaaaaay better in person than any picture can show. It's kind of a unique shape so I wasn't sure what it would feel like but it is very ergonomic. And the knot! Wow! Many of you already know this but the B5 knot is so dense, soft and has great back bone. I'm super excited to have it in my collection now. It's a work of art done by two very skilled artists.\n\nSo, during the lather games I used the same razor and blade combo the whole time to give all of the soaps a fair shake at performance. Declaration Bison was one of the best performing soap I used so I'm just going to use that for a while (I have a lot!) and try out different blades. I'm on the hunt for a blade with aggressiveness between Gillette Silver Blue (a tad too aggressive) and Gillette Platinum (a tad too mild). I like Pol Silvers' aggressiveness but maybe they could be a bit smoother? Anyways, I've got a personna red in the razor for tomorrow's shave.\n\nHave a great independence day, all of my Yankee friends!",

Off the puck, it smells *almost* exactly like Hook to me. It seems dirty, dark, and sinister. And just like Hook, I love the idea of that but not so much in execution when shaving with it.\n\nOnce lathered, though, oh my god. Shaken is kinda beautiful. It's still a little dirty and that probably comes from the so-called tobacco, gunpowder and musk, but there's also a fair amount of slightly fruity and floral notes that are most likely coming from the gin aspects. I'm a big fan of Stirling's Gin & Tonic on the Rocks and Chatillon Lux's Colbeck, so I think that may be what ultimately won me over with this one.\n\nAlso, even though it's not officially in the description I also think there's a pretty deep and beautiful vanilla-ish note, and I don't know where I'm getting it from.\n\nOverall, this was a surprise win for me. As much as I've come to love Storybook's soap base I've been having trouble finding a scent that I like. I still need to try Hallward's Dream tomorrow, but I honestly think this might be full-tub worthy for me.\n\nI know I'm late to the party, but great job /u/fahrenheit915\n\nAs for the hardware end, I still don't really like Astra blades.

Bandwagon is a fantastic barbershop scent, and it meshes well with Sri's deodorant. Speaking of, if you are looking for a new deodorant, I highly recommend the Wholly Kaw line. It's got a little burn to it when you first roll it on, but it clears up immediately and lasts throughout the day without any trouble.\n\nI love my seascape brush, and I'm super pumped to be getting an Dogwood Aurora soon (thanks again /u/Phteven_j), and my go-to razor for cutting through a few days growth is my ATT slant. Nothing else seems to clean up my chin as smoothly.\n\nFor you Americans, enjoy the holiday! To everyone else, light off some sparklers for us today, would you?",

Verde is, as the name would imply, a green scent. It actually reminds me of Acqua di Gio, which is a good summer scent for me. Taum Sauk doesn't necessarily match, but it should pair decently well and I need dat menthol.\n\nDoing a bit of blade exploration as well. I've tried the Dorco Prime blades 2 or 3 times now and they seem to do well. Last shave was with a Perma-Sharp, so I want to see how these compare. I was impressed enough with the Perma-Sharps on my last shave that I threw a 100 pack in my Amazon cart. Depending on how these Dorco perform, I may go with those instead.\n\nHappy shaves and happy 4th to you all. Drink some beers for me.",

I'm a little annoyed today. I've been working the 4th of July every year for the psst 6 years. I never requested it off, and the one year I request it off? It doesn't get approved. Best thing of all? People with less seniority than I do got the day off completely.\n\nWhat. In. The. Literal. Fuck.\n\nOn the bright side, it's time and a half. Still mad though.\n\nFirst go with the Duck Fat. This stuff is good. Real good. The scent is pretty damn good too, very bright and citrus forward. Perfect for the summer day. This soap is SLICK and very creamy. I love the feel of it.\n\nPost shave feel is really good. I especially love the aftershave. It has a good hit of menthol, and I really enjoyed it.\n\nThis Schick razor is really efficient, but it has a bite. It got me a few times on my neck, so I'll have to be more careful in the future, but still. This Schick is the best Schick I've ever used.\n\nI hope you all have a great day! Stay safe out there.",

So I gave the West Of Olympia Polo Red Clone from the PNW meetup another go. This is the new base and is pretty fantastic. I absolutely overloaded and overwatered this and it made no difference at all. It lathered up beautifully and I was able to get enough lather for my 3 passes and probably had enough for another 3. I'm also really starting to enjoy this slant. I sort of thought slants would be harder to use so I avoided them for a while, but got this one off the shave bazaar in a mystery box several weeks ago. It is nice and cut through the two days of growth rather nicely. Since I'm going to bed shortly (early work and the fact that my child is asleep makes for a zero percent chance I will stay up for any fireworks). Nice shave. Happy 4th everyone. For those not in the US, well, happy Wednesday.",

Heat index values as high as 98. South wind 5 to 10 mph. High tide at 5:11 this evening.\n\nShave was nice this morning. Soap performs well. The aftershave on the other hand.\n\nThe A/S is pretty much all oils, with hemp oil being a big player. With the viscosity and the flow restrictor it takes a while to get an amount that will cover my face (about 3 drops). While the label says it's non-greasy, I find it to be a little greasy, that doesn't absorb into the skin very fast. Now we come to the scent. Yes it is an unscented product, I'm taking to mean there are no scenting agents added to the A/S. Because of this, to me, it smells strongly of hemp, and not something that I want to smell like going to work, or just out in general. I washed it off this morning, because the smell was turning my stomach.\n\nHave a nice Thursday everyone!",

It was so ungodly hot, it's been so long since I've felt that kind of heat. Anyway, I did such a disservice to this lather it's not even funny. Second pass lather ran out on me, and was thinner than thin - like close to what you get out of hand soap when you're washing your hands. Icarus don't care though, I still had an irritation free shave. Every time I use it I pretty much am tinkering with it because I know it can handle it and that makes me want to experiment to find what works best. The rest of the day left me with such a moisturized and supple face it was unreal, like I had used some top grade moisturizer or skin routine when in fact all I had done was shaved. The only thing I can say against it is the freaking menthol in the aftershave- lights me up every time and leaves me hating life for 1-2 minutes after the shave.",

So I chucked the theme in my fuc-, frankly I'd rather not today bucket.\n\nInstead I continued on with my project: a study in Declaration. Today was my 2nd run with B4. Definitely getting that luxury feel now and understanding why these are the metric by which all others are judged.\n\nTook the kids to fireworks last night. It was the first year my youngest (2 years old and change) was awake to see them. The look on his face was adorable, hilarious, and heart warming. It's that look of amazement that only happens a few times in life: Christmas morning, cotton candy for the first time, fireworks for the first time, discovering what the internet is actually good for.\n\nIt's such a look of wonder and joy.

I like that subtlety a lot, and I think it's a great soap, but the main fragrance that I get out of this is....pencil shavings. As soon as I smell it, I imagine that I'm in 3rd Grade again and I'm waiting in line at the crank pencil sharpener as the shavings are dropping into a pile on the floor and Ms. Merkely is yelling at all of us to put the trash can underneath.\n\nI also get herbal notes. Can't quite put my finger on it specifically, but my guess is something like basil.\n\nThese days, I try to not read soap descriptions until after I've tried to figure it out for myself.\n\nAfter checking out the official description, looks like I was spot on with the basil. Not sure where I'm getting pencil shavings, though; maybe the sandalwood? As for the supposed bergamot and citrus notes, I actually don't get those in Hallward's Dream what.so.ever.\n\nNot sure what's wrong with my nose :(\n\nOverall, this one is definitely pleasant and interesting, but my previous dislike for Shaken has turned into praise and somehow surpassed my expectations for Hallward's Dream....\n\nTalk about an upset.\n\nAs far as the entire Storybook line is concerned, I'm very impressed with all of these soaps. The base is absolutely fantastic, and even if not every scent is a winner for me personally, they're at least unique and a fine twist on the usual suspects.\n\nThe fact that Storybook seems to revolve around an artistic aesthetic (mostly writers and books) is just icing on the cake for me, considering I'm a professional writer and editor.\n\nAgain...I know I'm late to the party on these, but great job, /u/fahrenheit915. You do good work.",

Like my last shave this is my first time with these products and I'm blown away by these artisans. Darkfall is everything I want in a scent, smokey, slightly sweet, with a little decay so I don't smell like bath and body works. The performance was excellent, though I did add a bit too much water for my third pass. The CL Splash smells so fucking good it's ridiculous. Floral, citrusy, and an unexpected cooling which I think is from menthol but I'm not sure. A pleasant start to another fucking hot day. Here's hoping I don't melt while putting together the Lynyrd Skynyrd concert.",

With the recent Maggard sale I had to make the purchase of this soap and I am so glad I did. The scent is absolutely fantastic and the performance is one of my favorites right now. Absolutely a sensational shave.\n\nFinally Friday! Have a great day and weekend!",

I think I might hold out for the Stubble Buster version, though, due to the price difference. Happy Friday to all.\n",

Dense, slick, protective, couldn't ask for a better lather. WKDM and Icarus shine in the post shave but during the shave this is as good as it gets for me. And Mayflower is such a phenomenal scent, I really should use it more. Just a quick 1.5 pass shave and out the door this morning, feeling blessed that it's already Friday.",

Soap is fantastic. It's my basic standard for shaving soap. Super dense, rich, creamy lather. I think that Fine Accoutrements did a good job copying the Tabac formula, but the original seems just a little bit better performance-wise.\n\nAnd I really like the scent. I guess I should say \"scents\" as there is variation between the products. The cologne seems a lot lighter than the soap, for instance. The EdC has a sparkling, effervescent quality that might be due to the aldehydes. A soft, clean, powder-y cologne with a slug of neroli that's excellent in summer.\n\nThe soap smells deeper. The soap, and not the cologne, reminds me of a smoker's leather jacket. A friend's German father from childhood (1) was a smoker, (2) had a leather jacket, (3) wore Tabac, so this might just be an association that I formed during childhood. But I have seen \"smoke in clothes\" mentioned in other reviews (e.g. this [review](https://pourmonsieurblog.blogspot.com/2012/09/tabac-original-eau-de-cologne.html)) so there might be something there. I still haven't really smelled tobacco flowers, which I know some people say is the direct reference.",

New rainfall amounts between a quarter and half of an inch possible. High tide at 5:58 this evening.\n\nNice shave today. Head lather was a little sub-par today, but still slick when shaving, and that's probably what I look for most. Reloaded for the face, and got a much better lather. Can't wait to finally kill this soap, thinking one more shave.\n\nHave a nice Friday everyone!",

After having a good freak out my wife suggested that I just take the day off to take care of it, and because she's smart and I'm not, I did. I checked the battery and it's showing 12 volts (for those who don't know it should be showing about 14 volts) so I hope it's just that. I've taken the battery out and now I'm just waiting for the parts store to open to take it in and make sure. Otherwise I'll have to get it towed to the shop. *sigh* Oh!

If this isn't one of the most beautiful smelling soaps I've tried.\n\nHands down, this is full-tub worthy.\n\nI realized that between Noble Otter and Storybook, as great as their performance is, I'm not quite getting the distinct slickness that I get from Bison base, ass milk, reserve base, or even glissant. After the pass is done, it actually leaves my skin feeling squeaky clean, which is a good feeling in and of itself but not ideal for subsequent passes.\n\nIt's a great base overall, but I think maybe I've been spoiled by some of the above-listed soaps. The scent alone makes this worth the purchase, though.\n\nAs for hardware, I gave the Rockwell R4 plate a shot after using the R2 for so long. It was actually a tad rougher than I expected. I used to think that I was an aggressive razor kind of guy, but maybe I lean more toward the milder end of the spectrum than I thought.\n\nI think that means /u/Hyvasuomi79 needs to let me know when he finds something new that works ;)",

I love this razor, love the handle size. Absolutely beautiful razor, love the handle design, love the rounded indents on the top cap. Get a fantastic shave with the A plate, may also pick up a C plate as well.\n\nOleo soap is fantastic, so glad I gave it a try. The lather this creates is so slick and so cushioning I think it can make any shave smooth and comfortable. Also very easy to lather. The scent is fantastic its a great barbershop scent, not too heavy on the citrus.\n\nEnjoy the World Cup if you can!",

It was a scorcher today, so Orange Menthol it was. Usually, I have to deal with razor burn with the first shave of a new blade. Not the case with this Astra. Though I'm finding that the menthol is starting to not be as strong with each lather, and I admit, it does feel disappointing. The scent is also starting to fade from this soap. I did order just a sample size, but I still find it odd. The Azur Lime is still my absolute favorite aftershave, and I wish there was a soap of it.",

The soap has a unique synthetic menthol that lasts a bit longer than traditional menthol and also is scentless. The soap has a definite pineapple smell, and I liked it off the puck. It also has a damp slightly dirty smell, which I presume comes from the ozone. I wasn't sure if I'd like that as I prefer clean scents generally.\n\nThe scent does open up a bit when lathered, and fortunately for my preference, the fruity notes predominated. The performance was very good, and I had a smooth comfortable shave this morning. /u/rocketk455 you've done a great job with this soap! I wish I had the matching splash as I know that really makes the shave (the synthetic menthol is stronger and more long lasting), but it was still great.",

This is my first experience and, to be honest, I was blown away by it. Performance wise it was all you could ask for. Slickness was on par with the heavy hitters that I've tried. Post shave was wonderful as well. I didn't need the aftershave but I can't pass up a bit of menthol in the mornings. I settled on trying The Trail first because my wife, kids, and I listen to a podcast called Tanis which is set in the Pacific Northwest area and this scent is supposed to be reminiscent of that region. I've never been to that area but the scent hits my imagination right on the nose. I'll definitely be getting a set of this scent and put it squarely in my rotation. As for the razor, I'm still trying to get used to using a straight, so I only use it on the weekends because I move ridiculously slow with it. But, with practice, I'm starting to get a bit better.",

It is a loading and lathering machine and the lather is always primo. Come to think of it I never have any difficulty with any soap when I use it. I have had it for over 4 years now and it has never disappointed me.\n\nExcellent shave",

Work has been absolutely insane and after finishing up the Reserve Seville project last month my work ramped up even more. Add in the impending vacation and trying to make sure everything was perfect while I was gone was quite a stressful ordeal. I worked 5 - 12's for about two weeks straight and was drained. Silly me taking a vacation right?\n\nWell finally my wife and I got to leave last Saturday and I was so stoked. 2 nights in Naples, 8 nights in Capri, and 1 last night in Naples before we head back. It's been beautiful. So relaxing, incredible food, good shopping (I'm eyeing some Tom Ford Fucking Fabulous for my special vacation purchase), lots of drinking, and beautiful sight seeing. The WiFi has been shit which has been great to prevent us from phoning much. I've gotten to read a book which is icing on the cake - side note: Living with a Seal is a fantastic read.\n\nI knew before we left I had to pack my shaving provisions perfectly so I planned them out in my head ahead of time. I acquired quite a few Reserve samples from my B&M purchases and they have come in so handy. They really are the perfect way to travel shave. I brought two other non-B&M artisan shave soaps and it has become even more apparent to me how incredible the Reserve formula is. I am probably the biggest shill for all things Reserve (hence the reserve Seville project) and this was even more of an eye opener. The other soaps lathered fairly poorly in this hard ass Italian island water. More than I've ever experienced before. Lacking any cushion, thickness, and hardly any slickness. All features these soaps are regularly known for. Reserve? Thicc, chushy, slick, yogurty goodness with an incredible post shave. Didn't even flinch. I brought my slim along with a variety of blades. Damn I love this razor, I'm late to the vintage game but they're so good. The synthetic brush is the way to go too.\n\nI knew when I packed everything I had to bring Reserve Cool. Italian barbershop scent in Italy? Yes please. And it's so incredibly perfect and fitting. I can't say I have been the biggest fan of this scent but somehow I appreciate it now more than ever. Even my wife said, \"What's that smell? Is it something Italian? It smells like an older Italian man\" and she's spot on. It's probably not the most fitting daily scent for me at 29, but it's perfect for the location. Plus the menthol is also perfectly refreshing after a day in the sun.\n\nThis has gotten pretty long but I've missed all you turds. Congrats to Doc for winning the shit post award and congrats to Nex for runner up, both couldn't have been more deserving. Shout out to Itchy for doing that, you're awesome. Overall, I'm glad lather games is over. That shit is hard to keep up with, or at least is was for me. I tried my best but actually had to quit posting because my brain was so fried from work I couldn't even think of funny stuff anymore. Props to all you dudes for sticking it out.\n\nCiao ladies and gents! Back to drinking, eating, relaxing, and diligently trying for baby number 1! See you all on the other side :)\n\n",

I'd like to try the matching aftershave. I'll probably buy a set once I get somebody to buy my Stirling menthols on the bazaar.",

West wind 5 to 10 mph becoming south in the afternoon. High tide at 7:39 this evening.\n\nSo a couple of things happened this shave.\n\nFirst is that I have a mole on the back of my head that I am usually good about being careful around. Well this morning I wasn't careful enough. That sucker came off. At first I was hoping that a few dabs from the styptic pencil would be good. Continue on with my head shave, and finish that up. Rinsing off the dome, and the styptic didn't help in the slightest. So that's when the Neosporin (the wife is fanatic about the stuff) and the Band-Aids come out. Let me tell you it's fun trying to band-aid the back of your head while holding a mirror up to see where to band-aid. Seemed to have stemed the bleeding.\n\nSecond, and probably the more exciting is that I finished this soap!! IT CAN BE DONE! It took everything I had to use it this morning, just wanting something different. But now it is done. Now to pick my next soap kill, something that I could use during Austere August. I am thinking Dapper Dragon Autumn Morning. It's a nice scent, and Scale Polish will be nice in the August heat, but I'm not a big enough fan of the scent to save it.\n\nHope everyone has a nice Sunday!",

[This shit right here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wAnV0363ZA) is probably my new fav, my new [flavor flav](https://imgur.com/gallery/4sZVQ7B).\n\nThe scent really does smell like black tea, i am not good at picking out notes or scents, and this isnt a review so i really cant help ya with that. [We're Sorry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15HTd4Um1m4)\n\n[Now ive smoked alot of dope but this is one of the dopest dope ive ever smoked](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkrRwrNgAbU)\nThe lather was creamy just how i like it, plenty of cushion and protection. The slickness is what really sets this soap apart, i felt like i was using a cartridge razor again, it was just sliding down my face and i forgot about technique for a minute before i came out of my daze. This is a base i will definitly be getting more of soon and i am glad i picked up this set. If you are on the fence of Noble Otter i highly suggest you try them out, they might be your new favorite soap just like mine :)\n\nHave a good day guys, happy shaving.",

Seriously, u/NobleOtter, you're killing me! This is truly one of, if not THE best soap bases I've tried. And the scent is phenomenal as well. I love the spicy take on the barbershop scent. Seriously, if you haven't tried it out, you owe it to your face and your nose to give it a shot. Still trying to improve with the straight. And, of course, Midnight Stag is also a new favorite. Great start to the day today!",

I don't want a huge den, so I limit myself to having only certain scent profiles in one soap. For example, no two lavender-, tobacco-, or fougere-centric soaps.\n\nProblem with \"fougere\" is there's kind of a sliding scale to it, so some can be way different than others.\n\nWith this one, it's kind of missing some woodier/floral notes that I look for. Instead, this one is actually quite sweet. Can't put my finger on what it is exactly, but definitely a sweet one.\n\nThis is also now my third time using the WK donkey base and welp....still amazing. I know this might seem like overkill, but I really *can* go without a post-shave routine with this soap. It really *is* that good. It's half an hour later and my face still feels like I just freshly slapped on some moisturizer.\n\nThe ingredients agree with my face so damn well.",

Today was already good in the respect that I used Reserve Spice and my vintage Shulton Old Spice, but then was made even better by the quality of the shave I got. The lather was fantastic as expected with Reserve base, and for some reason it was just a fantastically smooth and close shave.\n\nHave a good Sunday, everyone!",

It's a real shame they discontinued this soap, because it's a very good scent, and the performance (same as Tabac) is great. The slickness of the soap is its best attribute. It's a real head-scratcher to me that they continue to make a polarizing product like Tabac (sorry Tabac fans), and discontinued this product, which has a smell that I think just about anybody could appreciate. But, I suppose sales numbers don't lie. Anyway, I'm glad to have scored some of this. I really enjoyed using it this morning. I should pick up the matching aftershave splash, which I believe is still in production.\n\nThe CB aftershave was a good pair with the soap even though it's not an exact match for the scent. Florentine Fern has a pronounced fennel note, but it's not overbearing, and the scent on the aftershave doesn't linger too long, which I prefer. A very good shave this morning.",

Today's shave was Nectar Amissa. Soap base was wonderful as expected. The scent itself is nice, but my only problem is that the scent strength is a bit low for my preference. Blame it on the years of smoking, but even since I put the cancer sticks down in January, I still personally prefer stronger scents. Either way, still a great shave and a good way to start a Monday.",

Awesome feel, great cut, and all around a happy face afterwards. It included a number of \"firsts\" for me, as well, which is always fun.\n\nTo start off, I used my new Unconditional Surrender set. It's a fantastic scent that I knew I had to have after smelling my dad's set of it. The tub of soap arrived before I went on vacation, but the splash ended up coming the first day I was gone, so today was my first chance to use it. Like I said, the scent is fantastic, and the post shave feel of the splash, and even the soap alone is top notch. I have never had the pleasure of owning my own full tub of the Declaration Bison base before (previously only using samples and borrowing from my Dad's full tubs of it while I'm back at home for the summer), and I have to say that it is even better than my previous sampling of it was. This is fantastic stuff. It also pairs surprisingly nicely with Trumper Spanish Leather, which is a win for me because I don't own the EdT of Unconditional Surrender.\n\nToday was also my first time including Alum as part of my post shave routine, and I definitely enjoyed it and plan on keeping it a part of my routine. I've been using the Stirling balm since the Maggard meet and just haven't gotten around to including it in my write-ups until now. It has a great face feel and helps to increase the staying power of scents on my dry skin. I've also been using the Coral Skin Food as a preshave since the meet and while it might just be a placebo, I do think it helps my shave when I include it.\n\nAll in all a great shave to start the week! Have a good Monday, everyone!",

This brush really sucks - the knot is good and all, but the weight is just stupid and it looks stupid. I'm afraid to put it on my shelf so it takes up precious counter space instead. Luckily this AdP cream whips up really quick and I didn't have to spend too long loading or lathering. I'm guessing the pre-shave added quite a bit to the post shave as my face felt very hydrated and supple afterward. Putting a little CL toner on top (Fourth & Pine really does go great with AdP btw, more as a complimentary pairing like steak and wine), and this was one great shave. I actually feel ready for this Monday and am not dreading the work week for the first time in awhile.",

Actually, it might have overtaken 42 as my favorite scent, and my girlfriend likes it more than 42 as well so that's a plus. I'll definitely be picking up a set once the EdC drops later this year. I'm still working out how much to load, as I criminally underloaded my brush this morning for fear of overloading. Had to keep going back to load more between passes. I've gotten it right before, but it's not quite second nature to me yet.",

It is likely far less developed than most folks here, but it can never hurt to get rid of some software that gets very little use or that I didn't really take to. I'd imagine my first shave software (AoS Ocean Kelp pre-shave oil, cream, balm), and Stirling Baker St. (which unfortunately causes my face to burn) will hit the Bazaar soon.\n\nHappy Monday, all.",

Excellent base, much superior to older L&L base... but the scent. Kind of mild, undistinguished, vaguely sour and bitter. Smells like weak citrus rather than anything woodsy / grassy, which I was expecting from the (admittedly vague) scent description.\n\n* The Icarus base is really quite good, in the general ballpark of Reserve and WKDM, especially in terms of post shave and density / cushion, but the scent really disappoints me, especially after such a long wait for new Declaration scent designs. After Cuir Epices, Darkfall, Mayflower, even After The Rain, Contemplation seems less ambitious in design and less original in affect.\n\n* Not an awful scent by any means, and no hint of gaminess either in tub or when lathererd. I hope the old scent line-up will be ported to the Icarus base ASAP.\n\n* Frag: The scent that launched a thousand ships. Despite my general lack of love for aquatics, the originality in CW is still striking many years after the fact, and the price point has gotten much more palatable.",

I had a Wickham Classic 24 / Creed Aventus style setup over the break and it was fantastic.\n\nElvado is new to me. It's extremely easy to use and is a solid performer. The scent on this is a lot like Cool Water if you've smelt that. The Proraso matched surprisingly well as a post.\n\nI've been using the Game Changer for several shaves now. It's very good, although I do have to do some clean up under the chin and around the neck to get BBS. It's a matter of angle, this thing is silky smooth and efficient once you've got the angle down. I'd recommend pairing with a sharp blade, I imagine you might have to do a lot of cleanup and buffing if you use like a Voskhod or something. The Astra paired well. I used polsilvers all last week which were great too.",

I think this is the first time in a long time I've used the fat handle tech for my head and a fair amount of cleanup was required because it just wasn't as efficient as the AS-D2 (which is still packed away from the trip somewhere).\n\nToday while I'm at work, the pretty little wife will be picking up the keys to our new house.

I love the almond/cherry scent on this, and the performance is great. It's like Cella, but a better performing version of it.\n\nThe brush lived up to my already high expectations. It's soft, it splays easily (but isn't floppy at all), and was just wonderful. The gel tips are already there, and I hope after a few more uses it will be more apparent. But, already, this brush has shot up to one of my favorites. It's truly a functional work of art.\n\nTo finish, I used AdP, which seemed appropriate given the Italian soap pairing. I'm feeling good and smelling good--can't ask for more than that.",

Some of the storms could produce gusty winds. Mostly sunny, with a high near 87. West wind 5 to 10 mph. New rainfall amounts of less than a tenth of an inch, except higher amounts possible in thunderstorms. High tide at 9:28 tonight.\n\nI think that this will be my next kill soap. It's nice cooler weather scent, but I like to used matching products, and the menthol in the Scale Polish has me reaching for other items in the autumn and winter months.\n\nHave a nice Tuesday everyone!",

What's been bugging me is I'll listen to weather reports and they're all saying it's going to be \"slightly cooler\" and that's just rubbing me the wrong way. If anything, maybe they can change their wording to say \"less hot\" or \"not as hot\" which is more accurate in mind. Slightly cooler means fuck all when the cooler is the outskirts of hell rather than the middle of it, assuming that that would be cooler. Don't mind me. I'm just hot and tired so I'm a little spicy this morning. Have a nice day.",

I really like the extra blade feel on the R2 vs R1. Epsilon Blue brings me right back to being a kid at the barber, and it performs well. I can't say enough about Oleo soap and its kind of awesome that its from Chicago to boot.\n\nFrance vs Belgium 2:00 ET gonna be a great game!",

Though the Timeless has the smallest blade gap of the three razors, blade feel / harshness is more pronounced.\n\n* Frag: C&E makes some great \"summer\" EDCs: minimal projection, ordinary longevity, but charming and unique scents. Morocco Myrrh is the least impressive, with their sandalwood and lime scents being superior. Still, MM is a fine choice for hot days when you don't want to stage an olfactory Gotterdammerung in your surroundings.",

Just like LFP, I also get a strong baby powder smell. I have absolutely no idea where I'm getting that from.\n\nFrom all of these samples, I actually think B&M Reserve Fern might be the closer match to MdC Fougere, but it's been a little bit since I tried a sample of that stuff.\n\nBlack Fern is really good, though, and I can see a splash of it being a good pairing for MdC at the very least. The soap is also a great performer, and on a basic aesthetic level I like that it's black and even the lather is a little grey-ish.\n\nThanks again to /u/Hyvasuomi79 for letting me give these all a shot. It was really helpful.\n\nOn the hardware front, I've been having some pretty rough shaves the past few days and couldn't figure out why. I popped in a new Kai blade and that was the issue. Didn't even realize that my blade was tugging pretty bad.\n\nDid half my face with the old Kai and half with the fresh Kai and it was like a night and day difference. Kinda sucks, though, because it makes me realize that Kai blades don't last all that long, and considering they're the more expensive blades, they're not the greatest economical decision.",

This is definitely one of my favorite scents. I love lemon flavored cookies and cakes and the soap smells exactly like them. I also like that the splash smells more like a fresh lemon. I've had my eye on the Supply Injector for awhile. I'm a big fan of GEM style SE razors, but up to this point had only ever used 1 injector, my G1, whis is also a great razor. I saw this Supply on he bazaar for a good price, especially since it included the aggressive and mild plates. I decided to start with the normal plate. I can't imagine how the mild plates feels, because the normal one felt about as mild as a razor can feel. However, it was still incredibly efficient. Based on how it felt i figured I'd have a pokey face, but I'm pretty damn smooth. I'll definitely be trying out the more aggressive plate. The Supply definitely jumps itself in to my top 5 right off the bat.",

Super slick and great post shave feel.",

This has been my setup for a few days now; it's that good.\n\nIt's funny how wetshaving opened up a whole new world for my nose. I'd take note of certain scents that were pleasing before but never really paid much attention or actively sought them out. It turns out that I really like floral scents, a lot. Violet, iris, rose, honeysuckle, etc? Gimme so I can sniff it like a huffing junkie. I can't get enough.\n\nIn my little corner of the world, the fiancées family is in town visiting. We were supposed to go fishing tomorrow (I even took a day off work for it) but her brother decided he had a better idea and cancelled it. From what I hear, everyone is arguing with each other, insulting each other and just being couyons. I hear someone threw out the \"the men will side with me\" tactic so I'm going to keep my head down and mouth shut.\n\nAs I sit here and write this, my spayed chihuahua-sized dog is humping the leg of my male boxer.

The cooling agent is very nice, wish it was stronger but I understand people may not prefer that.\n\nI wish I had bought more AS because I feel like I'll be using this a lot while it's hot out.",

Instantly springs up to a lather, but more water is necessary to really get it to a nice consistency. The cooling sensation is not a bracing menthol experience, but rather a steady backnote that still lingers an hour later. It's not part of the fragrance profile at all, which is novel to me. The tangerine is a clean fresh note - not a candy, but rather that you just twisted a slice of peel.",

My manager had a little meeting with my department and cancelled OT for a couple of weeks. Then I got home and found that a Fatboy I just bought arrived. Now for the downs. I cleaned up the razor and everything looked good except the adjustment riser was stuck. The dial was working just fine but the plate will not move. So I looked up options and tried messing with it, but eventually had to go to bed. Cut to earlier this morning and I messed with it a little more and the adjustment spring broke. So now the dial moves freely without stopping and the riser is still stuck. Now I'm thinking about sending it in to have a professional fix it.",

I did snag 2 sets and then 2 more splashes when they went half off. Still, it's a personal favorite and I dread seeing the ring of death in those tubs.\n\nMoving into the house is progressing fairly well so far.

Even Noble Otter's BarrBarr was probably my least favorite of his lineup.\n\nThis stuff is delicious, though.\n\nIt's also increeeeedibly close to Storybook's new Hallward's Dream (or I guess I should say Hallward's Dream is close to Bandwagon). I don't see that as a diss against Hallward's Dream, though. They're both great.\n\nI get the same thing out of Bandwagon as I do from Hallward's Dream....**pencil shavings**!! I just have no fucking idea where I'm getting that from but it's the main thing I smell. And not even in a bad way. I guess maybe it's like a fresh woody smell or something. But Bandwagon also gives me some really bright herbaceous and citrus notes, which is a welcome mix to the combination compared to Hallward's Dream.\n\nPerformance is astounding. It's just easily some of the best stuff out there, period.\n\nI've got three other soaps on my \"to-buy\" list that would still top Bandwagon, but I could easily see myself getting a full tub of this one in the future.\n\nAs for the hardware, it was my first time using the Fatip since I've had a few days growth now. It slices through hair with ease, but it also has a pretty intense blade feel compared to the Rockwell on R2 with a Kai blade which has pretty much been my bread & butter lately. It's strange; I used to think I needed an aggressive razor, but now I'm starting to lean in the opposite direction.\n\nThe Fatip is still a fantastic razor (with some of the best machinings on the threading btw), but I honestly don't know anymore if it will stick around.",

Loved the scent (though it dissipated quickly?), but was dissatisfied with the lather. Maybe because I was working from a sample and didn't have the water ratio dialed in correctly, but I ended up with plenty of volume, but not as thick/creamy/slick as I had hoped for. Need to watch some remedial \"lathering for dummies\" videos. Been using the Game Changer for about a week now, and really like it. Much more audio feedback than my other razors. I feel the blade, but not to the point that it's uncomfortable. This was also my first use of a Merkur blade (gift from a friend, who bought them in Japan, of all places). I quite liked it--will be interesting to see what kind of longevity they have, considering the premium price.",

I couldn't get the lather right the first time -- it was too thin and bubbly. So, I added more cream, only to find that chunks of it weren't lathering.\n\nI used just a regular bowl with no ridges. Maybe I \"need\" one? Also, I didn't really spread the cream in the bowl -- just a plop in the middle. Maybe I'll smush it and spread it a bit next time... and add water SLOWLY.\n\nFinally, I think I might be sensitive to the fragrance in this as it felt a little itchy/warm on my upper lip area. Odd since I didn't get one when I got a barbershop shave in London and when I tried it the last time at home.\n\nOtherwise, I feel like the razor/blade combo really kept this shave from going really bad. Also, used every post-shave product in the den to soothe the skin.",

This is hands down my favorite fragrance that I own. It's inoffensive enough that I can wear it often to the office, but also nice enough to wear while out and about. It's a very fresh citrus opening and then dries down a bit woodsy. The freshness I best describe as clean, my wife even said it's a bit soapy, but in a good way. I'd definitely consider it a safe scent, it's definitely worth a try even if you aren't really into frags.",

This is my first time using Mike's soaps. I love Barbershop soaps, in general. This is a harder soap than I'm used to using but lathered up very easily and provided a nice, thick a lather. I watched a video yesterday of Will from B&M talking about low structured vs high structured lather and this is definitely a high structured one. I love the scent as it is the same scent as my first soap, Maggard's London Barbershop. The Island Man doesn't particularly go well with this soap but I've never let that stop me. It smells great-like coconuts and it makes my face feel pretty good. The Baby smooth/Feather combo worked much better this time than it did earlier in the week. Great stuff.",

I had a great lather for the first pass, but it seemed like it almost vanished during the second pass. I didn't notice any residual slickness at all, so going back over spots without soap was a mistake. The scent was also *very* mild which bummed me out. Based on the smell from the sample, I thought this was going to be the citrus bomb I was looking for.\n\nAnyway, maybe I need to give it another shot and work on getting used to the base. I'm just glad the Flying Hide aftershave salvaged what I did to myself.",

In a shave scent market where many artisans have either retreated from vetiver or just shove it in a scent all by itself or with some lemon, it's refreshing to see what a talented scent maker can do with my favorite aroma element. Declaration does indeed smell parchmenty, and yet the vetiver note is clear. I own this and Darkside and also signed up for the Reddit exclusive soap, and I look forward to seeing further creative use of vetiver from this brand. It's good to see them moving away from all that sweet stuff!\n\n* Brush: A 30mm badger is unusable for non-head shavers IMO. But a 30 mm synth - ah, perfect! The Tuxedo retains its precise bulb shape over time and when splayed does not apply lather to one's ears and eyebrows, as the blooming 30mm badgers all seem to do. The Dogwood handle is gorgeous and has aged perfectly, and the knot is set perfectly. Moreover, despite what one might expect, the 30mm Tux needs minimal loading and provides more than enough lather for a 4 pass + shave.\n\n* Frag: L'Occitane makes some fairly good summer scents - interesting, low projection, moderate longevity. Vetyver is pretty neat, being a nice combo of sweet and woodsy. Don't pay full price for these scents, wait for a sale from L;Occitane, which happens frequently. Unfortunately, they pulled the plug on Vetyver so this specific scent is not available, but Cade, Cedrat, Baux etc are all decent, and Vetyver may come back one day.",

The scent off the puck is a mild-mid tangerine that goes to mid-strong tangerine when lathering. The lather isn't elite level, but it's perfectly fine. I didn't get much menthol cooling off the lather itself. The aftershave, on the other hand, is still tingling my scalp with cool goodness an hour after I put down my razor. I do have two complaints, though. First, as with my other THB set, there's nothing to restrict the flow of the aftershave, so it's incredibly easy to pour way more than you intended. Second, they used some pretty strong coloring in the aftershave and while it didn't stain my scalp/face, it did leave an orange spot in my brand new sink that I had to scrub out. It also stained the back of my hand somewhat. I may have to invest in some kind of device (eye dropper, pipette, whiskey thief, etc) for extracting splash from the bottles when I decide to do THB shaves.",

It's very nice, but I'm also a little iffy on coconut.\n\nDoesn't do much for me, but it's certainly pleasant.\n\nPerformance-wise, as far as the actual shave itself is concerned, it's really good but not exactly a game changer in my mind. The post-shave feel, however, is very close to something like WK DM. I certainly haven't tried everything under the sun, but so far, WKDM is the one base where I genuinely feel like I don't need a post-shave routine; it's just so incredibly rich and nourishing. This Icarus base is certainly up there for the post-shave feel.\n\nI *do* like how hard the puck itself is. I'm getting tired of the super soft soaps that are basically creams anyway.\n\nShore and Contemplation will be used the next couple days....",

Whoever was here before me had the AM/PM backwards on the alarm clock and I didn't notice until just now. Phone alarm was luckily a backup but still.\n\nToday is going to be a rough one at work (a lot of silly stuff going on and questionable decisions from upper management effecting our operation) and is likely the last weekend I'm going to be traveling. We went to one of our last baby doctor visits this past Friday and they said the baby was probably coming in the next week or two even though the due date is technically 8/8.\n\nYou know what's nice though? All of this gear. The SynBad knot is growing on me since figuring it out (knot needs to be wetter than normal if that makes any sense) and Taum Sauk and Nekro both smell so good. I wasn't sure about the pairing at first but I actually think they compliment each other fairly well.",

I think Sudsy Soapery's vegan line is very underrated. It's quite slick, and the protection it offers is some of the best around. I recently learned that Sudsy Soapery introduced a tallow base, and I wanted to give it a shot. It's also very good, and to be honest at least after one use, I think it's a marginal improvement over their vegan base, but I can't say I noticed a huge difference in performance. I've always liked their base, and I like this one too.\n\nThe scent on Uplift is lemon/lemongrass. It's quite strong, and smells like a fresh lemon to me with a bit of sharpness. It's not complicated or sophisticated, but it's bright, fresh and natural smelling. If you like lemon/lemongrass scents, you'll like this one.\n\nThe balm has the same scent as the soap, and the scent on this is also fairly strong. It's thick (I almost confused the balm for the soap in the sample containers I had), but it's protective. It's a bit greasy, but I didn't mind that. About 20 minutes later, it's mostly absorbed. I think this heavy balm would be excellent for dryer winter months.",

Patchy fog before 8am. Otherwise, mostly cloudy, with a high near 72. Southeast wind 5 to 10 mph. New precipitation amounts of less than a tenth of an inch possible. High tide at 12:51 this afternoon.\n\nNice relaxed shave this morning. One of the cats woke me up around 5:30 so decided to get in the shower. Was done showering, shaving, and wasa just about done making breakfast when the wife and small one woke up.\n\nThis brush is probably my favorite brush. The handle fits my hand great, is light so the hand/wrist doesn't get fatigued while lathering my head, like it can when using the C&R handle. Not to mention the B5 hair, soft tips, and just a very nice face feel.\n\nHope everyone has a nice Saturday!",

She used it last night on her legs and I borrowed it this morning to give it a shot for my face. Now, I've used THB before from a trade and it's pretty good stuff. I mean, not the best thing ever, but still a pretty damn solid product in my humble opinion. This time, however, I'm gonna be honest. I fell in damn love with this non-mentholated cooling agent. Between the soap and the aftershave, my face is delightfully tingly. Definitely a fan of the cooling without having my eyes and nose just pour.",

A bit of Google research revealed the existence of Hawaiian Shaving Company, which happens to operate on the Big Island of Hawaii (which I would be visiting). I got in touch with Al, who runs the joint, and found that there is only one store on the island that carries his wares: Island Naturals in Hilo. So it was that last week, my wife, the teenbeast, and I left the kindergartner with the grandparents, climbed into the rental car, and drove the nearly 2 hours across the Big Island from Kona to Hilo to visit Island Naturals.\n\nThe peppermint dominates the scent profile, but the orange is definitely there. The scent on the aftershave didn't last as long as I would have liked, but it was a nice finish to the shave. The soap performed just fine with decent cushion and slickness, though not much residual goodness. I think what sets this soap apart from most others is the inclusion of activated charcoal. Thanks to the charcoal, the soap looks like recently cooled lava and left my face feeling very clean (though not terribly moisturized).\n\nOnce we get all of our stuff into the new house and I can get my shave den in order, I'll be PIF'ing three 1oz (because that's the only size they had) tins of HSC soap. Movers are coming to unload our last pod of furniture tomorrow, so I'm expecting to be moved into my shave den by next weekend (unpacking my clothes can wait).",

The NO had more of a sweet aroma than I expected, sort of a nutmeg or spiced chai? Different than most other Barbershop scents I've tried, but still very pleasant. The lather yielded a lot of slickness, very forgiving--this was my 3rd use of the Merkur blade and I found myself doing a lot of buffing, without any irritation. I had already opened the Reserve Cool sample yesterday, so figured I might as well plow through the remainder. Talk about a whiff of nostalgia! The scent brings me right back to the old-school (Playboys on the coffee table) barbershop that my dad used to take me to when I was around 7 or 8 (back when both of us still had hair that needed cutting). This is also my first venture into alcohol-based splashes. I had heard great things about the Reserve line of AS and I have to agree. A very nice cooling sensation without any \"yikes\" feeling at all. Probably my best overall shave since I got into wet shaving.",

However, I need a little variety back in my shaves, so I brought all the bins up from the basement this morning. I'm not going to unpack everything, but it's all going to be up here so I can easily change things in-and-out of the bins. I can easily put it back in the basement if needed. I feel better.",

Northeast wind 5 to 10 mph becoming east in the afternoon. High tide at 1:45 this afternoon.\n\nWent with tried and true hardware this morning to see if the irritation caused the other day was due to new equipment or Fletcher. And the verdict is: Fletcher. First pass was fine. The second pass is when I started to feel the burning, Started in the mustache area, and just seemed to spread, slowly. Rinsed off and applied Field Day, and I think it must have been the alcohol in the splash that lit up my face. It was bad enough that I had to take some hand soap and wash my face to get the burning to stop. So Fletcher is a no go for me. If I remember right, Fletcher also seemed to be an issue for a few other people as well, more so than his other offerings.\n\nHave a nice Sunday everyone!",

I can't tell exactly what makes it up, but the green label kind of gives it away. It's a greenish/earthy scent with a bit of sweetness backing it up. I feel like there's actually a bit of coconut from the Sweet Lemon somewhere in there, but who knows, could just be my imagination.\n\nAs far as performance, though, I'm really not quite getting it. The post-shave feel is definitely great, but slickness just feels lacking. I've actually had some fairly rough shaves the past few days with this stuff because my razor keeps suddenly stopping and changing angles on my skin.\n\nWhen my razor starts gliding along my soapy skin what's left behind is sort of squeaky clean like I just washed it with a bar of soap. This makes some touch-up passes feel very forced and jerky.\n\nAnd yet, somehow, the post-shave feel is still fantastic. Based on my description above, the post-shave feel should be dry and tight, but somehow it's just not.",

That required me to get my Mühle STF out of its case in my Dopp bag. I also made a 35-40 swirl loading rather than 25 as Will had done because I didn't load enough to suit me. Other than that I did exactly what Will was doing. This synthetic brush does make creating a lather with a trickier soap base a whole lot easier. Results: an excellent lather with excellent slickness and residual slickness.\n\nThis was a shave with two days of growth and the \"inefficient\" Mamba SS made short work of it in three passes. Smooth as silk and no irritation. Niiice!",

I bought it to fill out an Amazon order. Using a stick just seems strange to me since I rarely use them and I am used to loading a brush with soap and not my face. However, every time I use a stick it always works very well and this soap was no exception. The scent is pleasant and it was very light once lathered. This would make an excellent travel soap.\n\nI honed this razor yesterday. It needed it pretty bad. I had 69 shaves on it since it last saw a stone. I used straight alcohol as an aftershave to see how much sting there was to gauge how keen the edge is. This is the first time I have ever tried this. There was some sting, but not near as much as I expected and it dissipated almost immediately.

After being up most of the night and dragging ass to get ready for work this morning, I decided to go with Seville. It's the one I always turn to when I need a quick, no fuss, but good shave. I hadn't shaved all weekend so I had a good three days of growth and went with the V3A, which is always a great way to cut through the forest. Seville is just excellent. Nothing else to say, really. You can't beat the scent and the ease of use. This is one of my favorite combinations all the way around-blade, razor, brush, soap and aftershave.

I want to vomit. This is horrible, work sucks why do I have to work?! Can't I just sleep in and drink all day?\n\nFairly good shave other than a few nicks which I'm not really use to getting. I attribute it to my lack of experience with the Rex. I grew out my goatee while on vacation at my wife's request and that shit was so uncomfortable, so glad to shave it all off. I am committed to trying to love the Rex but so far after the nicks I am still not impressed. My face feels wonderfully smooth, this razor is more efficient than I prefer but I think I need to figure out the angle. It doesn't click for me like the Karve or Slim do but I need to give it more time I think.\n\nHappy Monday guys, great to be back.\n\nPS Fuck Work",

If they'd just make a YRP-scented deodorant and anal elasticity revitalization topical ointment, why, my entire morning routine would be covered.\n\nThis is actually my first use with bison YRP. I picked it up at the meetup along with 18 other tubs (*almost* half of them not being completely shitty). No surprises.\n\nIt's hardly fair. So, so many soapmakers don't even have a *good* soap base. Even fewer have a great soap base. And only a handful of soapmakers have an elite soap base. So why should it be that Declaration Grooming can have two elite bases when so many have so little?\n\nRise up, soapmakers. You have nothing to lose except your chains. We need a redistribution of soap bases NOW. In my mind's eye I can conceive of the day when Col. Conk commands his army of wetshavers using something more than just a commercial glycerin melt & pour; when Viking Revolution are true revolutionaries and plunder a good soap recipe from these fat cat soapmakers; when coconut oil can stop being used in shaving soap and gets retired to the food pantry where it belongs (and also into the bedside table, in case daddy needs some of that good-good but didn't get mama's button pushed enough beforehand).",

There's still a storage unit with our dining room table and a few other random pieces that we'll need to fetch this week. One of those random pieces is my great-grandfather's desk, which contains some toys from the 80s that I very much want to get my hands on because I have a project in mind and I'd like to get it on track.\n\nGreat shave this morning. I think this is as close as I've gotten to BBS with the Fatboy. I'm only just starting to explore life with an adjustable. Also, I am a big fan of Flowers. It's a nice, relaxing scent to kick off what I know is going to be a very hectic week.",

Did my cheeks on the WTG pass, and a bit of the neck although had a bit of trouble being able to see, pulling the skin with my hand, and getting my SR hand into a position I could comfortably cut (mostly sideways on neck). Managed to go XTG on my cheeks and neck much easier (as that was pretty much straight down). Still haven't stropped yet but that will be on my list of to do's before next shave.\n\nEdit: stupid new reddit formatting",

This soap base is awesome, scent reminds me a lot of B+M Classic (I had an AS sample). Scent is light to mid strong.\n\nA bit of a rough time on my neck with today, I'm surprised since this is a setup that I've come to know well. But the C Plate is more aggressive than the Game Changer and the Rockwell on 4, and I've been using those consistently so perhaps it's a muscle memory issue. In any case, the blade had been binned in case that was the issue. This worry free blade binning has got to be a top 5 reason to DE shave vs cartridges. No pushing the limits required!",

I get a really close shave with it and my face feels great afterwards. It can give a false sense of how well a blade performs though. I first used Gillette Platinums while using this soap and it made me think that Platinums were good for me when in reality they're just okay. Today the Bolzano performed well. I've been using them a bit lately and I've had an interesting experience so far. They seem a bit aggressive compared to Voskhods or Platinums while I'm shaving but afterwards, when I'm just walking around, I notice that they don't leave as many red spots on my neck area. Weird. Unexpectedly, I like the original Pre de Provence scent over this one so I might be passing on this 63 to someone else eventually. In other news Reserve Fern pairs interestingly well with Lavande Poivre. Happy shaving!",

I nervous as a long tailed cat in a room full if rocking chairs, so I had a couple sips of bourbon to calm the nerves. My buddy u/Dr_Facilier and u/iamsms recommended some YT vids to watch before I got started, and I honestly tried to watch them. Alas, I am stupid and impatient, so I just went ahead and started shaving, and didn't stop until I finished a bloody 2 pass with and against.\n\nIt went....ok. only bled at my Adam's apple, corner of my jaw, and my butt chin. Thankfully, I still have some alum laying around, and it got the bleeding stopped fairly quick. Thank God for these slick as owl shit soaps our artisans make for us. Shore is my fave right now, smells good and performs off the charts. All in all, it was a good experience, and where I didn't hack myself up, I am smooth. Will try again tonight.

This right here a great soap for me. I use surprisingly little product and have more than enough for four passes. I think I'll use another stick tomorrow.\n\nIt would appear that I did a decent job of honing this razor. It glided over my skin with zero drag. And like yesterday, I can detect no irritation. I don't think I need to tune it anymore at this point.\n\nWork sucked more than expected yesterday. I actually expect it to suck more today.",

No issues at all with the shave today, and my face is feeling great.\n\nI'm really enjoying this Lucky Tiger balm recently.

Some storms could be severe, with damaging winds and heavy rain. Areas of dense fog before noon. High near 81. South wind 5 to 10 mph. Chance of precipitation is 80%. New rainfall amounts between three quarters and one inch possible. High tide at 3:36 this afternoon.\n\nWhile Hallows is not a warm-weather scent, I sent out a couple of samples earlier this week and that has seen me wanting to use this soap. Today seemed like a good day with the weather we are suppose to get. Was a nice shave. I am starting to get the hang of the Wolfman, I think, was a smoother shave today than previous ones. Hoping it's going to be a good day.\n\nHave a nice Tuesday everyone!",

Performance? Well, it doesn't Souq, but MLS is kind of a second tier tallow these days, but still a great bargain and will get the job done.\n\n* Brush: no fuss, no muss, shaved wonderfully out of the box. Never lost a hair, looks tinier than it performs, but loads and dispenses lather perfectly, and cleans up in 30 seconds. Ergonomics are awesome and relatively unique, and the jade pattern remains very pretty. A good check list for what one should look for in a higher priced brush, and Paladin seems to have pretty regular releases of new product, meaning one can avoid being on The Waiting List of Sadness.\n\n* Frag: C&E Indian Sandalwood is absurdly high quality for its low price point, and maybe the cheapest intro to a good sandalwood scent. (Proraso Red being the runner up, but a bit blander in affect.) Of course, C&E discontinued this fine scent, and indeed much of their male product lines across the board, but it can still be found at many retailers.",

Nicked the mole over my right ear but the alum block stopped it right up. I'm not sure how I'm feeling about Tuesday. It's light and clean, but it may be a bit too Febreeze-y for my tastes. I'll give it at least one more go before I make the call. TryThatSoap says I should like the EdP better than the soap/splash, but at 3.5 and 3.2 respectively they're not expected to be my favorites. I'll see about giving the set another shot next week.",

New hardware upcoming from Charcoal Goods and Above the Tie has arrived, but needed a fairly mild shave and had been meaning to try Adagio by @barristerandmann all summer. To my nose this scent has earthy florals with dark cherry and lime in the very back...bitter lime. Extremely unique, and has that menthol kick. It's one of those scents that at first you feel puzzled, but then it grows on you.\n\nMy overall score for the base is 4.5/5.\n\nLather: Barrister + Mann Adagio\n\nBrush: Maseto 26mm 2 Band Finest\n\nRazor: Rockwell 6S R2\n\nBlade: Wilkinson Sword\n\nPost: Adagio Splash",

I've slowly been on the hunt for a perfect lavender-centric combo.\n\nChamps is pretty fantastic. Had a slick and efficient shave and smelled great doing it. It's clearly not *only* lavender but that's the main note.\n\nReserve Lavender splash smells *really* odd straight from the bottle. I can't fully describe it, but it's like there's a hint of lavender in there and then it's kind of putrid. I seriously want to poll anyone who has this splash if they get the same thing from it straight out of the bottle, because I'm wondering if this was just a bad batch.\n\nOnce applied to the skin the initial smell is definitely lavender. It's an odd lavender, but it's still good, and it feels very nourishing. Maybe not quite as nourishing as something like Chatillon Lux salve, but for a splash, it's up there with one of the most nourishing in my opinion.\n\nOn the dry-down, that weird smell comes back. It's still lavender but it's something else... This is going to sound bonkers, but it sort of smells like eggs and food coloring. Like, it takes me back to being a kid and coloring Easter eggs...and not necessarily in a good way.\n\nI don't know. I'm flip-flopping on this splash. Sometimes I love it and other times it's just the weirdest thing I've smelled in a while.",

Fatip seems nice, good weight, comfortable, not particularly aggressive. I did only two passes today, as I shaved late yesterday, and it was a pretty good two pass shave.\n\nMontrose Beach performed great as the other Oleo soaps I have tried. The scent however I'm not too sure about. Supposed to smell like beach but all I really smelled was very sweet bubble gum. We'll see how it is after a couple more shaves.",

Can take a good amount of water from my experience and it just *feels* good on the face.

Rodgers & Soms 11/16 FH\n**Post:** Lucky Tiger - Oil of Olay Complete\n\nFirst use of this soap. This may sound strange, but I like the scent more off the stick than when lathered. It has a medicinal smell to it according to my nose. Not at all offputting, just not as nice as most of my other soaps. I went nuts with the loading. This brush can hold quite a bit. In spite of the brush's ability to hold a lot, I had lather running all over the sink top. This would make for a good travel soap, but I would rather take La Toja or especially Valobra as stick options. The Palmolive provided a good shave, but it dried my uber dry skin out more than the other two sticks.\n\nThis razor has quite a number of shaves on it, but it doesn't seem like it needs honing yet. I let it go for a bit.",

No nicks or irritation whatsoever. It still feels a little lacking to me. I'm personally a fan of alcohol based aftershaves and I'm TRYING to stay open minded about toners. Well, this toner specifically that I got in a trade. I miss the burn more than I realized that I would. My face feels nourished as fuck though, so I guess the trade off is worth it sometimes.",

Lathering actually proved difficult, as there wasn't enough soap to reform in the middle of the tub, and once I started loading, the soap broke into several small pieces anyway. In the end, I threw away a small, quarter sized flake that *may* have yielded another shave if I used a synthetic brush, but meh, I was ready to be done with it. Goodbye, old friend.

It's solidly in my personal upper tier/ultra elite/Cadillac/name-brand-not-off-brand-Fleshlight soap base, along with some combination of Barrister Reserve, and the two Declaration bases. In fact, I would not be mad if someone wanted to call the donkey milk base the best thing in all of wetshaving.\n\nBut scent-wise, I've had a hard time finding something that suits me in the Wholly Kaw lineup. I love my YRP and Tempest WKDMs, but it sorta feels like those don't count. It'd be like if you asked a kid back in the 80s who his favorite character is on Scooby-Doo and little motherfucker said \"the Harlem Globetrotters.\" Like, alright, the Globetrotters were indeed characters on the cartoon from time-to-time, but those were cameos, you little smart-mouthed shithead.\n\nThe easy answer for most people is \"Fougere Bouquet.\" And I'm a fernhead big time, but I. Just. Can't. Have you ever had a dirty hippie with white girl dreads drape said white girl dreads around your face in a shroud of sweaty, sexual, damp hair from all sides while doing the ~~Power Hammer~~ cowgirl postion? Well, I have. The smell of those damp dreads? Similar to Fougere Bouquet.\n\nThe other fougere in the Wholly Kaw lineup smells too much like Clubman to really work for me. At the Maggard's meetup I was smelling literally every tub of Wholly Kaw there is to find something that worked for me. Many were okay, some were merely good, others simply did not work for me and my weird white girl dreadlocks-tainted scent memories.\n\nBut I settled on this one here. And man, I'm glad I did. It's a simple scent, sure, but it is terrific. I'd go so far as to say that this has shot up to the Cadillac/Fleshlight tier of not only my preferred soap bases, but of my personal soap collection as well. I've only had this soap since June -- and only have started using it since the first of this month, but it seems like every day when I'm making my selection, it's on the short list.\n\nI don't have baking soda, but I guess you could say that [I'm in love with the Coco.](https://youtu.be/6vYnas6q3Sg)\n",

      "body": "SOTD Wed 7/18\n\n* Soap: B&M Reserve Lavender\n* Brush: Wild West Brushworks 24mm Tuxedo, \"Space\" color\n* Razor: Charcoal Goods Level II CC w CG Double Helix handle\n* Blade: Bolzano Superinox (1)\n* Post: CL Pure Lavender salve\n* Frag: Polo Safari\n\n* Product Notes:\n\n* Razor: CG was on its best behavior today, maybe because it had help from its friends. The L2 and the Bolzano worked well in terms of giving me a great Fool's Pass (upward stroke on upper list) as I need to get a lot of stubborn stubble off with a single pass there, and the CG normally has some issues with that goal Not today - the Bolzie gave the extra cutting power needed for max efficiency, and also felt more gentle than usual for its first use. This comes from the Reserve probably, which mellows everything out. Like George Peppard said on the A Team, \"I love it when a plan comes together...\"\n\n* Plus that damned 75mm handle no longer annoys me as much as it did. The expensive proposition of getting a new longer CG handle ($85) and having to join a Wait List of Pathos (\"Please, sir. are there any products for me? Do let me know!\") have compelled me to get accustomed to Ol Stubby, and it works fine now.\n\n* Frag: Everyone knows Polo (Green of course...) but Safari is Lauren's equally stodgy yet overpowered holdover from the 80s, even though it was made in 1992. This is a V12 of scents, but the balanced mix of light spices make it generally OK for summer. Smells a bit like Tsar, but with less floral presence, and some leather.",

It's my first time using Ghost Town Barber and I really enjoyed both the performance and the scent. I was particularly impressed by the residual slickness. I probably could have done another pass with just a bit of water if I'd wanted to. Also, this B5 knot may make a dedicated face latherer of me. On the one hand, so much went into obtaining it that I don't want to risk damaging it by bowl lathering. On the other hand, it's just so soft and perfect on my face that I can't imagine trying to build a lather on any other surface if I could be doing it on my face.\n\nCloudy and cooler in Seattle today. Highs today in the low 70s. I've got an all day \"off site\" meeting. In this case, \"off site\" just means \"in a building a block away from my usual building, but still on campus\".",

I told my girlfriend that and she told me that I need to buy more. She'll have to wait until September when the EdC comes out.\n\nVacation went really well. Austin is pretty sweet. u/DKowalski2 asked which scent I was going with for meeting the girlfriend's parents, and I was rude and didn't take a chance to reply. I went with Fine's Platinum, as it's my girlfriend's favorite next to the Reserve Lavender. My travel setup was a little different though. I took a travel tech, a Tabac shave stick, and my sample of Fine's American Blend, which got compliments from her mom. So that's something, haha. Her dad and brother are electric shaving devotees, so her mom said that she missed the smell of a good aftershave. I don't understand how someone could like electric shavers. They've always felt like they were pulling the hair out of my face rather than cutting.",

Don Jose is their Coconut and Banana scent with menthol crystals. Smells lovely, like a delicious smoothie or something like that, as for scent strength I'd give it a 6.5/10. Though it boasts that it has menthol, it is VERY light. Proraso Green has more menthol than this soap. That being said, it does leave a very nice, cool post shave feel.\n\nThe Chatillon Lux is lovely; sweet, citrusy, and the scent lingers a good while. I discovered you wanna leave your face a tad damp when applying, cos if you put it on straight dry it leaves a kinda sticky feeling. Other than that, fantastic shave. Have a good one everybody!",

Very runny, it's almost like a hybrid of a balm and splash. Bit of an alcohol bite to it, does not leave skin feeling greasy. Scent is strong for about the first hour or so, but fades pretty quickly after that - I can't really smell it now. Pleasant scent, very clean.\n\nI've been reaching for The Trail very frequently since I received it last week. Although it's slightly more draggy than Reserve or Declaration Bison, the performance+post-shave is still excellent and I love the scent the more I use it. I wasn't sure when I first received it, but now I can't get enough of the pine and fir scent. It really does remind me of camping - definitely preparing for my backcountry canoe trip coming up during August Long weekend, can't wait!",

It's been really fun to watch /u/NobleOtter start small on Reddit, and really grow his brand over the past year. It's pretty incredible how far it's come in that short time. I see Noble Otter SOTDs on other sites and social media frequently now, and almost universally it's praised as being a fantastic product in terms of performance, packaging and overall value. It's nice to see this being recognized, and I totally agree.\n\nThis scent in particular I think was a home run. It's one of those scents that when I go into my bathroom and pick up a soap to smell this one always seems to stand out to me. We're now into July, and I still think this is my favorite new scent this year that I've tried.",

Shout out to Will for doing that how to video because even for someone like me who uses Reserve a lot I learned quite a bit. I never thought to hit this stuff with a sopping wet brush.\n\nStill trying to fall in love with this razor, this time I used it at it's lowest possible setting @ .75 or whatever it would be. It's extremely mild at the lowest setting, not the most efficient. More efficient than say a Rockwell R1 plate but def not as efficient as a Karve A plate, maybe close to the AA plate. Irritation free shave but it definitely took a full 3 passes to knock down the growth. I went ATG on my chin which I don't normally do and no issues which was nice, this is definitely a very solid well built razor and the blade is held very solid. It's interesting because with only 1-6 settings this razor goes from mild to aggressive very quick compared to a Slim which has more settings.\n\nIt's baby Friday and I'm ready for this week to be over. Fuck work and all the people that exist there. I hate working, why can't our government figure out a way to pay us a lot of money without working?",

BV is based off a drink right? Some kind of whiskey thing I'm pretty sure.\n\nAnyways, as noted, 5 of the 6 items were gifts. Some from the most recent gift exchange where u/sgrdddy hooked me up and then the brush from u/Ythin from our previous gift exchange. Thanks again fellers.\n\nThe EJ89 was my second DE razor. I had a weishi TTO prior to that, but the EJ was a gift from my wife who wanted to get me an upgrade several years back. It's not my favorite razor, as I tend to lean towards something just a bit more aggressive, but I can't bear to part with it. Still though, it's a perfectly capable razor.\n\nThe Field Day edp our trusty u/rocketk455 gifted as sort of a baby shower gift to old dad here. Field Day is wonderful stuff and once that boozyness of BV wears off, I'll be using this to \"freshen\" up. FYI, I believe there's still some FD a/s available out there. If you haven't tried it yet and like fresh, summery, watery type scents you should really give it a try.\n\nThis has been a really long week (why is it only Thursday?!) so back to work peeps. We're on full alert baby watch at this point. Wife thought she might be going into labor last night, but as of yet, no dice so I'm gonna have to keep my phone on me at all times and be ready to leave work at the drop of a hat.\n\nHave a good day everybody and may your Thursdays go by fast so that we can all hurry up and get to the weekend.",

I mean, it's not like you'd order a Royal Tea at the pub during last call. Royal Tea is more like a drink you'd make after you got home from brunch out some place where you had a few Mimosas and three Bloody Marys, and you decided, fuck it, it's time to really ruin the rest of your day and get these drinks flowing.

Reserve yesterday, WKDM today. Burning question in my limited mind: is WK new vegan (with all the unpronounceable stuff) as good as their tallow donkey milk formula? I've thought so in the past, but never shaved with the two bases consecutively.\n\n* Now, I have the same scent in both bases. I love this rose / woods scent, but wish the name were better. Even \"Oud Man Out\" or \"The Oud Couple\" would be (somewhat) better than \"King of Oud\", which is just dull and bad. But the scent is lovely, and the bases are top tier.\n\n* Anyhoo, tomorrow I will use all the same equipment (different brush though) and with the same scent --- in the UV (unpronounceable vegan) formula. How will it compare to the tallow version? Stay tuned!\n\n* Post: I have a few different versions of the WK balm. This scent is the only one that has dragon's blood in it, and it works much better for me. No sting, instant soothing, no redness survives. I only hope the poor dragons are exsanguinated humanely in the manufacturing process...\n\n* Frag: Awesome woods / incense scent from Occitane. The strength and longevity are the best in the line, and the price is very reasonable, moreso if it goes on sale.\n\n* Theme: All high performing tallows seem to be mighty thirsty.",

I suppose today's shave was more of a *throwback Thursday* since it reminded me of the scents back home along the West Coast, but hey - it's five o'clock somewhere.\n\nThis shave was one of my best to date - a marked improvement since I first started. My lather game has noticeably gotten better after picking up samples from the Groomatorium (B&M Seville, B&M Lavender Reserve, Tiki Surfs Up, LASSC Santa Monica Bay Rum, TOBS Sandalwood) and playing around with each, practicing loading and slowly adding in water in bowl and on face. Each stroke was slow, smooth and deliberate, dialing in on that blade angle before drawing across the skin. The lather from Surfs Up was super smooth and easy to get slick within a few minutes, even with my garbage VDH brush that sheds at least 20 strands with every use. No nicks or cuts, very little irritation but no major razor burn (even though I had to make a few extra passes after 3 for some spots the blade didn't cut aggressively enough).\n\nAfter enjoying all these soaps and learning as much as I could about soap bases, I doubled down and just purchased a tub of Declaration Grooming Shore in the Icarus base plus matching aftershave. Life is good and getting better.",

Heck, first time in months I've scraped my head with anything other than my Bic or Feather loaded AS-D2. I went XTG on 4 and then ATG on 2. Produced two easily-handled weepers and got very nearly BBS. I am pleased. The Flying Hide, as always, is a great soap with a great scent. The Lyon came out of a bazaar lot and made a great companion with its leather and pepper notes. I think it's safe to say I'm looking forward to Will's Leviathan release in September.\n\nWhy does my coffee taste like chicken soup?\n\nBecause it's chicken fucking soup. Who the fuck left a Campbell's chicken soup pod in the box of coffee pods? I'm gonna kill somebody.\n\nThat is not right! I'm gonna kill someone...",

About 15 or so shaves, but I realized I had \\~2 oz left back then and dedicated the summer to making it disappear. Down to 80g now, tub weight included.. Shave every other day, and I'll use TSM 4-5 in a row then switch to another scent for a day before returning to TSM. This scent is amazing! Very fresh and bright and green. I'll definitely pick TSM up again at some point, but I am also wondering what other Fougere's people like best?",

There were major suds within seconds.\n\nThe soap can handle water, I'll give it that. But next time I might add water a bit more gradually, maybe a second flick of water out of the brush before loading. Performance was awesome post shave feel excellent, but I dunno I think the suds were a little more airy than I'm used to.\n\nSecond new Charcoal razor today, the SS mild - the handle is wayyyy smaller than my brass Hammered Handle which I got off the bazaar. I was a little puzzled at first because the also light, almost like a travel razor or something. In any case the mild Plate was awesome for today because I had barely any stubble (none visible) after yesterday's level 2 shave. Will need to give these razors some more reps before I review or comment, but I can say that the thing is nimble and I'm BBS with no problems\n\n\nLather: Barrister + Mann Reserve Fern\n\nBrush: Maseto 30mm Silvertip\n\nRazor: Charcoal Goods Stainless Steel Lvl 1, Hammered Handle\n\nBlade: Astra SP\n\nPost: Reserve Fern Splash",

In spite of my challenges, I got an excellent shave.\n\nOkay, so, three shaves in with this freshly honed razor and I am comfortable in saying I put a pretty good edge on it.

When one came up for sale recently I decided to go ahead and grab it. I've been waiting on a stainless steel model, but who knows if or when that might arrive. It's a great razor that gave me some smooth, comfortable shaves when I used it a few weeks ago. I had a very nice shave with it this morning. I still have a bit of stubble on my chin after going ATG, but I'm sure that's user error that can be fixed with a bit more practice. I'm glad to have it around. Of course, when paired with Sweet Lemon, it felt like cheating. Just wonderful stuff. Happy Friday to all!",

My secret santa gave me a B&M Tuesday set, and a Declaration Shore set. I decided to go with Shore today... let me tell you something real quick boys. If you don't have an Icarus base from Declaration, just go ahead and punch in those card details and get it. I felt like I couldn't get the damn soap dialed in all shave, did a 3 pass and didn't feel too great about how I lathered it. (purely my fault, not the soaps) Everytime I get a new soap in, I use alum just to gauge how the shave went. I had 1 small sting from my usual trouble spot, and that was it. I had what i felt was a bad shave, but the base was so forgiving that I ended up with one of the best shaves in weeks. What a testimony to the thought process of Declaration... they make damn good soap.",

Lathering was much the same - both quite thirsty with the New Vegan (NV) needing more water.\n2. Both produced a very smooth clean shave with no visible irritation or missed stubble.\n3. The TDM had a bit more perceived cushion. After doing the ATG pass on my face sensitive spots, the TDM shave had no soreness, while the NV shave had some minor pain.\n* Also, when I applied the post shave after TDM, no sting. When I did the same after using NV, mild sting for 5 or 6 seconds, indicating somewhat more scraping happened.\n4. TDM also has better post-shave. After I finish all passes and rinse off with warm water, before cold water soaking and post shave, I look at the mirror and think \"self, could I skip the cold water and post shave and just walk away at this point with my face feeling like it does right now?\". With B&M Reserve, the answer was \"Absolutely\". With WK TDM the answer was \"Probably\". With WK NV, the answer was \"No\".\n\n* I always use the cold water and some sort of post shave anyway, but that ten seconds of very unscientific and hypothetical pondering indicates that the WK TDM is a bit better in giving the delicate faced full and final post shave closure.\n\n* It should be noted that in both cases, after cold water and the post shave, my face ended up absolutely fine. So the two bases are quite comparable in that regard.\n\n* So at the end of the day is WK Donkey Milk better than the Newest Vegan? Yes, objectively, but it's kind of too close to call, really.\n\n* The NV is cheaper - 10% so if you order from the WK site. When I first started buying the NV, it was more like a third cheaper, but that was a limited time promotional price. Frankly, I liked that pricing better, as 10% does not incentivize me much to have a few minutes of somewhat less comfy shaving, even if it does all work out in the (literal) wash.\n\n* The NV has appeal to shavers who do not want to use animal products in their shaves. Arguably the best vegan soap formula currently available (and also the costliest, unless we count that weird Euro stuff that costs as much as a razor...) so some will buy purely for ethical reasons and will get a great shave in the process.\n\n* As mentioned, my face ends up in the same state after the whole shave process is done, so a few minutes of low level ouchies are not really the end of the world.\n\n* But, yeah, if you want the best possible shave (especially if you are Eggshell Face like me) and don't mind paying an extra two bucks to get it, WK TDM for the win...\n\n\n",

It smells amazing and brings back so many memories to camping/hunting trips I take. The best way to describe it is imagine you spent all night smoking your pipe around the camp fire with your friends, you wake up the next morning in the same clothes you wore yesterday to a crisp 47 degree clear mountain morning, there is dew on the ground and you can smell the earthiness of the dirt and grass around you, you are content. This is Roam basically lol",

I've hand lathered it about 7 times since and gave it a try face lathering today. What a difference, much softer and created a great lather. If thats the improvement over 7 days can't wait to see what its like at day 30. Also compared to my badger brush the lather seemed to stay more on top of the tips instead of getting buried in there and was released to my face much easier. My chubby sometimes needs to be squeezed to get the last of the lather to the tips.\n\nMontrose beach, I gotta admit the scent has grown on my a bit. Using that on a rainy day like today was kind of nice.\n\nNice weekend everyone.\n\n",

When I smell it I just think \"This is what Hallows would have smelled like if it were a spring-release.\" Other than that, this brush seemed to eat the lather, might have to start working it into the rotation a little more, just to get used to it. It's a nice brush, soft tips, but not as dense as a Declaration knot.\n\nHave a nice Saturday everyone!",

      "body": "[**An Aventus Shave of the Evening**](https://imgur.com/gallery/zIKHoXq)\n\nFrom yesterday evening. Quick notes:\n\nThe lather was awesome, smells excellent preforms very well; at first I thought the residual slickness is a tad less than a top tier soap like B+M Reserve or WK -- my last two shaves. What I realized is I wasn't adding enough water. For whatever reason I thought my lather was ready, but adding a good amount more water was super beneficial. So, this soap is a top performer for me. If you're looking for that marshmellowy effect though (which I'm not), this isn't really like that. I feel like I don't really own or use too many average or poor performing soaps anymore.\n\nThe razor worked amazingly well, I put my Charcoal level two plate in brass into the SS handle and top cap (and it looks stunning btw). This is a high efficiency set up. It's not as smooth feeling as a Karve or Rockwell. But with a little care this provided a pretty comfortable two pass bbs (wtg, atg). Barely anything left for clean up. From two shaves in with this level I feel I can use it for daily shaves but I have to be a little more cautious about technique.\n\nLather: Wickham Classic 24\n\nBrush: AP Shave Co, 24mm Tuxedo\n\nRazor: Charcoal Goods Lvl. 2, SS Hammered\nHandle/cap with brass base plate\n\nBlade: Astra SP\n\nPost: Executive Man Mentholated Splash, Classic 24 Balm",

It's stainless and pretty heavy and not what I am used to. I got quite a few bleedy spots probably from me being used to the lightweight aluminum. Give it a few days and see how it goes.\n\nThe red panda soap is fantastic for me. A lot of people share stories about soaps triggering memories. This is the first one for me to do so. Brings me back to my favorite drink from my childhood. It was my go to for years , drank note it while sick but usually everyday for a while during my chubby preteen stage. This satistes that for me wonderfully and provides a good lather with sold post shave feel. This will be in my den indefinitely.\n\nHappy shaves homies",

Patchy fog before 9am, then areas of fog after 11am. High near 72. East wind around 10 mph. Chance of precipitation is 90%. New rainfall amounts between a tenth and quarter of an inch, except higher amounts possible in thunderstorms. High tide at 8:25 tonight.\n\nThis was probably one of the best lathers I've had from the Dragon. Everything seemed to click this morning. Loaded for about a minute, spread it on my head, and then I went back and loaded again for about 15 seconds. I was also able to take my time and really dial in the water on this one. Over all a very nice shave.\n\nHave a nice Sunday!",

Nothing cold water couldn't cure today, but it puzzles me. I think it is me and not the razor because it has the same head as my 34C which is only overtaken by my Rockwell in terms of comfort. I think the problem is i am used to balanced razors. Any tips from people who use head heavy razors?",

Well, we found a house we liked on Wednesday (put in an offer and it was picked over 6 other offers), listed ours on Friday, and yesterday we accepted an offer on ours. That meant I could get into my stuff again. I'm not gonna unpack everything, but I'm gonna use some neglected gear for sure.",

Lemony. I think I'll keep it around. I don't always need to shave with sandalwood or leather and tobacco type scents. This was my first time with Oleo, and it delivered a nice slick lather with a bit of cushion.\n\n**Razor and Blade Notes**\nRough. Again, Irritation built up and by the end of third pass, was being so careful on my neck. Too bad results weren't all that great. Would be easy for a person 3 ft away to see that you didn't get a great shave. For my skin, this is not a good match.\n\n**Brush Notes**\nBrush performed well. I think it splayed some. Was gentle on this rough shave. Good. Lather was slick enough to make it work well, I think. 9th use of this brush.",

Figured I would play off the cedar in Lavanille instead of the Lavender and it is very nice combo.\n\nAfter some experimentation I have concluded that Bolzanos are not for me. Gillette Platinum still seem to be the smoothest, closest, and least irritating for me and can see myself using them forever. Part of the fun of this hobby though is trying new things so I'm planning on trying some more blades this week.\n\nThe Dogclaration is awesome. It had a bit of a learning curve but it has become my favourite brush. It almost cured my BAD but I think I'll be persuaded by the great handles from Dogwood and Bristle in the future and Declaration knots will only get better I'm sure (although it's hard to improve on perfection). I still love Semogue boars though, particularly the 1250 and the 1800 and will be putting them back in the rotation soon.\n\nAnyway, thanks for reading this far and hope you have a great Sunday!",

So yesterday's shave should have earned me some scars and stripes for an SUI (shaving under the influence).\n\nMy product selection was perfect. This is just my second run with the reserve base, and it is awesome. Has all the slickness and protective qualities in the tippy top tier, but even this time around it did not seem as thick as, say, Declaration bison, or WK new vegan. Definitely not a knock on performance, it's just different I suppose. Any tips appreciated if you think I might be doing it wrong. And on my next run I'm going to try it with a Synthetic knot - last two runs have been with dense badger knots. To note, this is a sample so I've been loading from my shave bowl.\n\nThe Rockwell feels like a baby proof razor that still gets the job done every time. Whenever I come back to it, I wonder why I keep buying any other razors, and I reminds me that I definitely have RAD.",

When loading the soap you get the marshmallow-like texture that some of my favorite soaps give, and that's a very good sign.\n\nI learned a lot by watching the video recently from Barrister and Mann about Reserve soap and the difference between high lather structure and low lather structure. This is a low lather structure soap, and I have realized that all of my favorite bases tend to be so. It's not the type of lather that would look good in a picture, but it's dense, slick, and very protective. Low lather structure soaps have more of a pasty texture than a fluffy texture, but they are slicker and more protective in my experience. It gave me an excellent shave this morning.",

Loved the fragrance immediately, and it wasn't too difficult to figure out how to dial in the right amount of water (it was a lot). Very very smooth during shave and post-shave, and the wifey loves how my face feels and smells.\n\nAlso first time using one of the green 7 O'Clock blades, which seemed to work OK. Did get a handful of weepers, but nothing bad and no need for styptic or alum at the end; just the price I paid for the balance of acquiring skill vs chasing the BBS. Felt more aggressive than the Personna.\n\nVery pleased with the purchase of the Shore set. That menthol at the start was surprising in a good way. Looking forward to trying some new seasonal releases like Darkfall and FG.\n\nIt's gonna be a good day, folks.",

I spent Sunday in the sun and ended up with a hell of a sun burn so I knew I needed something protective. I reached for the soap with the best post shave I've ever experienced, dat sweet sweet lemon goodness. The incredible post shave of Icarus combined with Kyovu was super moisturizing and this is most definitely the softest my face has ever felt. Incredible. This Kyovu is great shit, I'd love to see it come back in one form or another. It performs like a combination of Reserve aftershave and Latha aftershave meets Chatty Lux Toner. Very good stuff.\n\nI think I've finally figured out this rex. I do get incredible shaves with it, it's so solid, the blade is held so damn tight. At the low settings it's extremely mild and now that I have finally figured out the angle I was actually able to go ATG with it again using blade buffing on the lowest setting. We will see when my hair grows back if I have any issues but after putting in the time I'm actually getting some of the best shaves ever with this razor.\n\nMonday's suck but you know what sucks more?

The razor is top notch in terms of craftsmanship and aesthetics, and finding the proper angle was very intuitive. The razor on either a 4 or 5 easily plowed through 6 days of growth on the first pass. I went all the way up to the 6 setting for experimentation, which turned out to be a bit too aggressive for my face and resulted in a couple of nicks. I dialed it down to a 3 for the second pass and cleanup, resulting in a near BBS shave. I think the Ambassador will be well worth the money, and I'll likely hang onto it for life. Happy Shaves.",

I've been wanting to learn how to use a straight and had this razor for a while now but haven't used it much because my strop would always fall of my towel hook and it would piss me off too much to want to keep trying. The day off finally let me get around to buying a new hook so hopefully I can get better with it now. Still only using the straight on my cheeks until I get more comfortable with it, and GTB was great as always",

Did one WTG pass on my face and an XTG pass on my head. Really like the smell on the Reef Point soap and the performance was pretty good. The scent on the SdP balm was nearly unnoticeable coming out of the bottle, but it's gradually appeared in the last 20 minutes or so that it's been on my noggin. Lavender and black pepper is an interesting combo.\n\nFull day of meetings today.\n\nAlso, I'm not sure if I'm sad that 3rd wave ska has become the default genre for kindergartner's tv shows or happy that kid's tv shows are training a new generation to appreciate the most awesome genre of music ever.",

I had very little growth after a somewhat late shave yesterday so I used the Rockwell on R2. The combination of the extra mild setting and Catie's meant I literally did an entire clean up pass without relatherting. Dabbed my face with a towel and threw on the splash, and I don't even need balm, my face is fully hydrated. (To note, any time I use an alcohol based aftershave I pretty much have to use a balm because my skin dries out quite a bit, but not today). I keep touching my face as if pinching myself to wake up from this dream, but looks like it's reality. And so easy to use!\n\nI'm gonna use Catie's this week and try it with different set ups and even some on the more aggressive side. We'll see if this performance continues.\n\nThe Zenith boar has been soft out the gate, but there's a couple slightly scratchy hairs I can feel here and there. Excited to continue the break in process and see how damn soft this can get!\n\nCan't discount the fact that this is a somewhat new blade to me. Feels as sharp and smooth as its first use. Will keep it going.\n\nCompany moves to a new office today, It's supposed to be dope as fuck. Pretty great start to what should be a fun day.",

Plus, just got a sample/travel-sized version of the EDT.\n\nThe EDT is a bit too sweet for my liking. I still *like* it, but I think the scent on the salve is better tbh.\n\nThis was three or four days worth of growth and my hair came in pretty fast, so the Fatip tore through it and I had better form this time around. Didn't use as much pressure, and I realized that you don't need to give this razor that steep of an angle. A little angle goes a long way with this piece.\n\nAll in all, a fantastic shave.",

REJOICE !!\n\n**General Notes**\nlather was wonderfully slick, and I did figure out something about getting the razor to work better for me.\n\n**Razor and Blade Notes**\nFourth shave and **I think I might be on to something**. During the 3rd pass, The shave was getting a little irritating in the neck. Not as bad as the Personna Comfort Coated, but still a bit of a bother. I decided to bring the handle in, just a little closer to my face and see how that worked. The comfort increased dramatically, and I played around with the angle a bit. If I was shaving my neck, and it was irritating, I would close the angle of the handle just until the irritation backed off. I then felt a light and consistent cutting that didn't cause irritation.\n\nThe rest of the shave was **much more comfortable**, and I was able to do my usual 4th pass as neck-only. I hadn't been able to do this with the Dart for the last 2 shaves.\n\nThe **result was above average**, and i was very happy. i can't wait till tomorrow where I can do the whole shave with the reduced angle.\n\nSo if your Dart shaves are a bit too aggressive for you, maybe try reducing the angle a little. But reduce it too much and the blade lifts off the skin and you don't get a good cut. So this might be a skill to hone, for sure.\n\nAnd as far as **drag**, there was none perceived. And for you doubters, this is lather from a usual amount of soap. The standard 1/4 tsp I start with for all new soaps.\n\n",

I have several tubs and have sampled most of his other offerings. But I don't like Trade Winds. It's something to do with the salt water. My nose just isn't keen for it.\n\nIf Trade Winds is like being on a pirate ship 400 years ago, Arcane Abyss is like finding that ship and digging it up 400 years later. It's primitive. It's primal. It's been there a lot longer than you have and frankly, its intentions have grown a bit sinister.\n\nWhat I mean to say is that I think [these guys]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fzXmJyolfY) shave with Arcane Abyss.\n\nThis was a sample sent to me before the release. I spread it into a Maggards container and there it has sat, taunting me. I get up the courage to take a sniff every once in a while. It's heady, like a first kiss. The scent \"off the sample\" is strong, maybe an 8 or 9 out of 10. It doesn't let up. In fact, it seems to get stronger as it lathers, like it's pissed off for having been woken up.\n\nThe performance is great. Afterwards, my face felt equally great but the whole experience was unsettling. Borderline upsetting. Like a bizarre but voluntary sexual experience. I wouldn't take it back but it was weird. There's this scene in one of the *Dark Tower* books where the main character has to fuck this crazy sex demon in order to pass some waypoint or something. And I thought of that scene while I shaved my face this morning. I had to do it. I didn't want to do it and it felt weird and forced and awkward and it was a harrowing experience but I did it. I had to.",

It is by far not a scent for everyone, but I absolutely dig the scent. To my nose, it smells like an Atlantic beach. It has the smell of dirty water, which if you have been to OCMD, you know what I am talking about. The soap performed well, it was not as good as the top tier tallow based soaps, but as a vegan soap, it definitely surpassed middle to higher end tallow soaps and it's not that expensive either. So if value per dollar is your thing, take a look at this soap.\n\nThe big news here is the b5. It was kindly lent to me and I could not be more thrilled to have the opportunity to play around with this badger ass hair. The people are not lying about this brush, it is absolutely amazing. The density of the hair, the softness, it is magical. The key I found different vs my maggard brush is the density. The brush has so much more to offer and as it should for the price. Are these brushes expensive for some? Sure, but if you have the money, I don't see why you don't have one. Speaking of which, I don't have one....",

It's probably because I'm a former smoker, but I can rarely ever honestly pick up the individual notes that are given. I can, however, enjoy the scent as a whole and Contemplation is wonderful. It really does paint that olfactory picture of a still summer day. If only I could enjoy a day of contemplation like that... but I guess it's just another work day today.",

Need a break. Since this SOTD uses a new razor, I thought I'd give a mini-review.\n\nI've seen a few reviews on this razor (thank you /u/sgrdddy) and it kind of scared me that it may be too agressive. It was not. I like a mid-agressive razor and this one hits the nail on the head. It took 2 passes to get it done and I even did a third pass - not to push my luck - but to see if it was safe to do. No problems and no razor burn! I would say this razor is in the Timeless 0.95 SST range, but just a hair milder. (bad pun) Others have commented on the finish of this razor. I am guessing they can't read. Shane @ Blackland purposely created this razor to be machined without a lot of time in the finishing process. Time is what adds up in a hurry for these manufacturers. For less than a C note, you get a quality, stainless steel, made in the USA razor. I don't feel it to be rough or dragging. My Titanium Timeless \"drags\" compared to the SST or bronze versions, but I wouldn't say it drags. It's a tiny bit less smooth. I could say the same about my V3A head from Maggard. Make good lather folks! Great Tuesday shaves to all.",

Kelly came on, and I'm not sure how to handle this.\n\nIt's a good song. It's catchy with that earworm quality on the hook with the kids singing \"I wish, I wish, I wish. I wish, I wish, I wish.\" It's wholesome even, talking about the pain of loss, and why you should be living right.\n\nBut what are we to do with R. Kelly? Sure, we've known about the creepy marriage (illegal, and quickly annulled) to Aaliyah when she was just 15 and he was 27 since, like, 1995. And we knew, at the very lastest, since [Dave Chappelle schooled us to the game,](https://youtu.be/eafRE74JGZ8) that R. Kelly liked to piss on his fans, at least one being underage at the time.\n\nStill jamming R. Kelly post those revelations though. Feelin' on ya booty. Ya booty. Ya boo-OOO-tee. Biggity-biggity-biggity booty.\n\nBut the sex cult revelations, that's a game changer, right?\n\nSo can I separate the art from the artist? It's not like we ever stopped reading *Catcher in the Rye* and Salinger liked them young, too (though I am not sure if he liked to pee on them. Drip, drip, drip). Also William Burroughs killed his wife and Lovecraft was fairly racist even for his time.\n\nSo I dunno.",

I can understand how this could be in the realm of a barbershop scent, but it's not really super \"barbershop-y\" to me. It smells to me like some kind of cookie. Which is totally okay, because I really like it. Performance was fantastic, though I probably could have used a little more water.\n\nI'm on the fence with the GEM. I'm still getting used to it. The two blade stops are a little sharp, and it makes buffing a little difficult. The shave ended up being near BBS, but not without a few weepers and a little irritation. Glad I went with a Reserve aftershave today. Figured I'd try the Cool again, though it's my least favorite of the line. The menthol in it is about the perfect level though, and the initial scent is really nice. I just didn't like the way the fragrance aged on my skin the last few times I used it.\n\nHope everyone has a good Tuesday!",

I decided since it's going to be 85 degrees (even though it's only 55 out now) that I wanted to have a nice cool shave. Thus, I went back to the Creeper.\n\nI take back everything I said after my first Creeper shave about the soap not being as cooling as the splash. That soap is not kidding and it was delightfully chilly on every pass. However, the spray bottle into which I decanted the splash (because THB doesn't believe in orifice reducers) did not want to spray, making my splash application process more laborious than it should have been.\n\nAnyway, now all I have to do is chill out for the rest of the day. :)",

The blade is still feeling like shave #1 after 3 uses. Not used to this...\n\nThis brush was so awesome. It took 3 or 4 uses to get soft without any scratch, but it's there now. I like that it's quite dense but not enough to hog lather, so I have the pillowy effect without compromising the thickness of lather getting released. It also just loads up easier since it's 24mm - which might be the sweet spot for me, but all my badgers other than this one are bigger.\n\nStill feel the same about Adagio's scent. It's not super \"pleasant\" but that doesn't make it bad, it's actually pretty awesome. And the menthol touch is very nice.\n\nBeen using the Rockwell so the lower profile head on the CG was noticeably different. Lvl 1 is probably right for me as a daily driver. My previous use of Lvl 2 absolutely wiped out my hair with basically no clean up required, but felt like I had to pay attention closely to form. Will need to try Lvl 2 with some extra growth but haven't had the chance since I've been shaving daily.",

And we've got some **good news!**\n\n[The Video](https://youtu.be/vStJQRJxx2I), *which will be done processing maybe around 2pm today, says YouTube.*\n\n**General Notes**\nvery good shave. I think this was my 5th shave with this razor. Finally found the right angle for me for the Dart.\n\nCatie's Bubbles was so slick and I really enjoyed the Spanish Holiday. What a well-thought-out blend. It smelled great, so good that I wanted it a little stronger. i think I rated it at maybe a 4 out of 10 for scent strength. If you're like me and don't like feminine or dominant florals, then this one won't trip you up. It's a great blend of a hint of rose, with woody notes, and the musk thrown in ... just puts it in a sweet spot for me. At least that's my take on it.\n\n**Razor and Blade Notes**\nI came in ready to try the reduced angle that worked so well on my 3rd pass yesterday. However, it didn't work that well for the first pass... a little too scrapey for all that hair. I changed back to my normal, intuitive angle (maybe 30-35 degrees?) to get the most bite out of the 24 hours of growth. That worked well. As I think about it, I don't think I had irritation in the past from the 1st pass.\n\nThen for the 2nd and further passes, I changed to the angle where the handle is just a little closer to my face. This means that the blade moves a little closer toward perpendicular... just a little, mind you.\n\nThis made the shave so much more comfortable! I was even able to do a touch up on my neck after a neck only pass, after a full 3 passes! That was unheard of if you look at most of my past shaves with this razor. I was often not even looking forward to the start of the 3rd pass.\n\nBut, for me, the angle makes all the difference. I now can use the Dart with joy and confidence, and it gave me a nice, close shave.\n\nI am very much looking forward to trying more blades now that I have learned a good technique. And I feel that it has changed from, \"I'm looking for blades that won't hurt\" to a welcome, \"I'm looking for blades that will work well, while I sit back and enjoy my shaves\".\n\n",

I figured out the right angles to use.\n\nand this shave is special, because for the first time in maybe 20 years, I trimmed off my goatee to see what I'd look like with a Tom Selleck style Chevron mustache. Fun to do, but I won't be keeping a bald chin any more. Time to hide this Dudley Doright protrusion from the world in a goatee again.\n\nso this ended up being probably the one and only time I shaved my chin. i remembered vids I'd seen in the past, proceeded carefully, and it worked out nicely.\n\n**Razor and Blade Notes**\nFor me, this is a great blade/razor combination. Made extra special because this is a pretty inexpensive blade.\n\nNormal angle on first pass, and reduced handle angle on other passes is working very well for me. No irritation to speak of. But very close shave, with only some tips showing in my neck trouble spots. That's almost as good as it gets for someone who can't go against the grain on the neck.\n\n**Soap Notes**\n1/4 tsp plus some :: 4 tsp water (WD Boar)\n\nscent strength: 2-3 out of 10. Wish it was stronger, because this scent is very good. Tobacco and vanilla are the strongest notes. Others support and ground it nicely. great performance as usual.\n\n**Brush Notes**\nat second use, this brush continues to do well. Holds enough lather to do the job, and feels good. Happy with this knot so far.",

It doesn't like massive amounts of water like some of my soaps do. I am quite impressed with how well it performed and the post shave is excellent. It's not as economical to use as Castle Forbes due to the amount of product it uses to make a lather, but damn...it really is nice to use. Very nice. The post shave may even be better than CF. I'll have to compare them more judiciously.\n\nOff to more fun at work.",

After the debacle with the last one, I scored another Fatboy. This one is in great shape, though I think the door alignment may be off just a little. Either way it wasn't enough to deter me from using it. After a little cleaning and disinfecting it was ready to go. I set it to 3 which is my go-to, lathered up and went to work. I can tell it has just a little more blade feel than I was expecting but it didn't feel aggressive. I like the weight and the length of the handle. Overall I got a good shave from it. No wonder these are so sought after.",

It's my first time using Dr. John's, and I'm happy with the soap, as it lathers like a champ and performs just as well. The scent is similar to creamsicle and cider at first whiff, but you begin to pick up the vanilla and coconut as it opens up a bit in the lather. You can really pick up the vanilla in the aftershave, but the scent isn't aggressive at all, and the touch of menthol helps tie the shave together. Face feels smooth and moisturized. Would recommend this soap if you're looking for something on the sweeter side this summer.",

One of the few benefits of living in the Big Onion is proximity to Pasteur's and after years of pretty minimal product line curation, the place is finally stepping up its game by stocking desirable exclusives of which Governor's Island is probably the biggest scoop so far.\n\n* The scent is amazing - an aquatic done without calone, but using a mix of florals to be the \"ocean\", along with various wood notes. A pleasant summer scent but with lots of depth and complexity. Can't say it actually smells much like Governor's Island in my experience (grass and food trucks) but is an interesting take on an NYC variant of Tallbot's natural style scent designs.\n\n* Post: AV Sensitive Balm has nudged Nivea balms firmly aside to take the Best Post Shave You Can Buy at a Big Box (BPSYCbaaBB) prize. AV has enough moisturizer in it to eliminate the need for added lotions, and it soothes redness quickly with minimal sting, A well done mainstream product, and a very competitive product in the sadly shrinking world of quality after shave lotions.\n",

The feel of the softness of the bristles and the way it generates a perfect lather is just outstanding. Absolutely have loved using them so much that I will be having a custom brush handle made and sent so I can hopefully get a B5 before it runs out.\n\nHappy Hump Day!",

Just working through some samples and getting more used to the GEM. I will say it's a little weird going from a DE to the GEM. I'm used to a more rounded top cap and the thinner blade. The GEM blade definitely feels thicker and does not give at all. I can't say one is better than the other, it's just different. The Pushbutton somehow is as efficient as my favorite Tech but seems harsher. It's probably just a pressure issue though because the Pushbutton is definitely more on the head-heavy side. But I kinda love the handle, especially for the ATG pass because the little nubbin thing on the bottom of the handle gives a bit more grip when you're making upward strokes. Still loving the Barrbarr though! Can't wait to get into the sample of Nectar Amissa that should be coming in today. So far I've loved everything I've tried from NO. I've got a feeling that pretty soon I'm going to have a lifetime's supply of soaps...",

This thing is absolutely awesome. Perfect size for me (24mm), set at the perfect loft for splay and backbone, and tips so soft that painting lather provides a perfect distribution across the face. There's a custom handle on order that I might throw another Tuxedo in since I've already got a handle hanging out with Scott at Declaration for the B5.\n\nOnto the actual shave. I typically do 2 passes up and down, but to change things up today I tried a cross grain pass. Short story is I'm going to be sticking with two passes wtg/atg. Something about the angles cross grain don't feel comfortable for me, especially around the mouth and neck.\n\nCG Lvl 2 feels good. It's definitely mid-aggressive and not \"mild\"",

There was just a thin ring left so I grabbed this brush hoping the stiffer bristles would get into the corners, and it did the trick.\n\nThe NEW DeLuxe used to be my favorite razor and was my daily driver for quite awhile, but I don't reach for it much anymore since I started to develop a preference for milder razors. Still a very nice shaver, it won't be leaving my collection even if I only use it occasionally.\n\nHave a good day everybody!",

I will say, I followed as closely as I could and I got a great lather with not quite as much work as I normally use. I always get great shaves with the reserve line, but using these specifications made it much easier. I love the scent of this soap and aftershave more than anything else I own and the lather was fantastic. Very comfortable and slick. I did a three pass with the 57 Super Speed and can some times get a little irritation with that razor, but not today. I didn't even get a hint of burn from the aftershave.",

I caught a mole on my chin which just bled and bled throughout the shave and I think I hadn't fully gotten over the soreness of another shave. At the moment though my neck is the same colour as Santa Claus, it will go down in a few hours but I'd rather not have it at all. I think I just rushed my shave.\n\nI also struggled a little bit getting the soap going with face lathering, its a sampler that I got recently and I've moved to a big tub. In this hot weather though its gone very soft, so when I was loading rather than making some lather to work it just seemed to transfer as a paste. I managed to work it to a good lather eventually but I started form a very different position to where I would normally after loading the soap.",

While I tend to agree with this statement, it cannot be denied how good this soap still is to use. The lather was a perfect density, protection was great, and slickness was beautiful. I do not use this soap enough due to the collect-ability of it, but when I do bring it out, it is always a joy to use.",

      "body": "Soap: Santa Maria Novella\n\nRazor: Rockwell 6c\n\nBush: Dogwood Timberwolf\n\nBlade: Perma Sharp\n\nPost: RR SMdF; Lucky Tiger balm\n\nWell, I spaced the theme again. I have been doing an experiment lately comparing the Rockwell 6s to the 6c. Both are great razors that give me consistently great shaves on a daily basis. Below are my thoughts about the things I like and dislike about each:\n\n6s: The 6s feels substantial, and I belive that it holds the blade a bit more securely than the 6s. It might be a product of its additional weight that is causing this outcome, but I believe this to be true. I don't like how Rockwell brand is printed on the side of the plates. Due to the fact that it is not polished, I don't feel it glides as well across the skin as the 6c. The additional drag of this razor is the major drawback against the 6c in my view. It's not bad, but it's not as fun to use because of it.\n\n6c: This razor wins on price obviously, but I also greatly prefer the way the razor glides due to the plating. It's more pleasant to use, but as noted above, I think there's a little more movement in the blade. It also doesn't have the Rockwell branding on it, which I like. Neither razor is going to win a beauty pageant but it helps. The lower weight might be a plus for some. I personally don't have a strong feeling either way about the weight difference.\n\nMy verdict? It's a tough call. I like the security of the blade in the 6s, but I like the glide of the 6c. My dream is that Rockwell would release a machined and polished 6s. Maybe someday. I've also considered attempting to polish a 6s, but I'm not sure if that a good idea.",

This cream flys under the radar for the most part. It is a really good performer priced very reasonably. The cherry scent might be a turn off for people that don't like cherry scents. This is definitely an in your face cherry scent. Real cherries. In terms of scent strength, if Castle Forbes made a cherry scented cream, they would use this as a model. In terms of performance it is not quite up to the level of Cade Rich or Baum.be, but at its price point it represents a good value.\n\nWork...yuck.",

I'm not gonna waste time going into the soap base or the shave quality. It's fuckin fantastic. Anyway, the scent itself is a different sort of smoky aquatic type. It really put me in mind of Captain Ahab looking for his white whale, but finding something else altogether. Then, right before I typed this up, I looked up the scent notes for the soap and boom, there it was: inspired by H.P. Lovecraft. It completely fits. It's not my favorite, but it's definitely something everyone should at least get a sample of to try. Shit's pretty damn nice!",

This is a bit more of a sophisticated scent, with considerably less citrus and more pepper and spice notes.",

I really like this razor. I kept seeing people praise it but for some reason I never gave it any attention. It gives a really nice shave. I can get a better 2 pass shave with it than a 3 pass from just about any other razor. It is quite comfortable as well.\n\nI think I'm a convert to boar brushes. This thing whips up a nice lather as well as any and the way in which it releases it is awesome. I think Ill be looking for another; larger knot size and a little more backbone and maybe a little scrubbier. Any suggestions?\n\nGood luck on your Thursdays!\n",

I was mostly interested in having it for travel, but had also heard good things about Elvado with comparisons to Caste Forbes thrown around. The scent on it is really good - the notes are bergamot and rosewood but all I get is a really nice orange-like citrus. This took more water than I expected but was pretty easy to whip up compared to most soaps. The performance was as advertised. Dense, slick, and protective, with that nourishing butter/fat feeling after the shave. I suspect that this wouldn't be the best to use without a brush as it really did take some work to create a good lather, but at the same time I haven't ever used anything that I would say is just as good without a brush. I also can't imagine a scenario where I travel without a brush as that's the last thing the TSA would ever take, so whatever. If you are in the market for a shave cream or one of the scents (like this orange, or the lime they offer) then I would buy this without hesitation.",

For my skin, at least, i have found the best blade for this razor so far! finally got a smooth blade feel on my cheeks with this combo! Other blades gave a little blade edge feel, once my technique got dialed in, which was fine, but they could never be considered \"smooth.\" This one sure was. I pulled the razor down my cheek on the first pass and almost couldn't feel the cutting at all. And... this was a blade currently in its 4th use!\n\nthe Dart was as predictable and consistent as ever. And with this blade in it, I almost didn't have to do my 4th pass neck only run.\n\n**Soap Notes**\nScent strength: 3/10\nTub load: next time I'll try adding 1/2 tsp water to tub, then 1 min load (it's the 2 oz tub that I have).\n\nClean scent, but not via detergent type smell. Smooth scent. in looking at the scent profile (after the fact) I see that it is a tribute to the Tommy fragrance, popular back in 95. My puck must have lost much of that scent, because hardly any of those notes were available to me. I did, right at the end, I think, pick up on a little citrus on the high side, and maybe some woodiness or light bitterness on the low side.\n\nSlick and protective, with good cushion, as usual for CB.\n\n",

It looks stunning brand new and I can't decide if i want to keep it that way or let the patina develop.

The results were... wonderful. I was especially careful regarding pressure, and a two pass shave was every bit as smooth as a three pass with my regular DEs. I'm looking forward to refining the technique even further, but not a single nick or weeper for this first go. I used alum for the first time in about 9 months just to gauge how I did, and there were no especially sore spots. The first voyage with the slant - great success!\n\nAs for the soap/aftershave/frag, it may be my choice for what I understand to be \"Austere August\" coming up around here. My shave den is by no means deep enough to support the Lather Games, but this one I can participate in. I may choose this one because I've got a near-full tub of the soap and about 110ml of the EdT to work with, because I've dialed in lathering Stirling soaps, and with starting a new job in 1.5 weeks, Polo Blue is as benign/clean an office scent as one can find.",

The more I shave with it, the more it opens up to me, and the more I start to enjoy it.\n\nThis morning, I just kept trying to figure out what frag I would pair this with. I think this works, but I believe the non-Sport version of this might work a bit better. Don't really care for the watery notes on Sport models of frags as much as their base frag. This one isn't too bad and the Pour Un Homme de Caron Sport isn't terrible either.\n\nWhat are you guys pairing this with?\n\nThanks again not-so-Secret Santa!",

Picked up an NOS Deluxe set last week and I've been itching to use it. The lather on the bison tallow formula was so incredibly slick the razor was just gliding around. Who needs lubrication strips?\n\nWithout a pivoting head this razor has a similar face feel to an injector, minus the blade feel. It took me about the same amount of time to shave with a Trac II that it takes to use a DE so I don't think this razor is taking over any time soon.\n\nBut it was still interesting to use the razor that first killed the safety razor. Up next is the Silver Plated Gillette Sensor.",

I really dig this new synthetic brush, it is just as soft as the Tux but overall a little more pliable against my face. It also feels a little more dense. It was a tiny bit tougher to load, but made up for it with an easy and enjoyable face lather. I also like the feel of this handle, I think I am finding that I enjoy the brush grips a little longer so they reach into my palm. Soap was great as always, this line will be my recommendation for anyone getting started.",

It's like a luxury version of Cella. If you like the almond/cherry scent of Cella you owe it to yourself to give this one a try. It's really good stuff. I've heard there are other scent choices in Italy, which would be wonderful, but I've never found a reasonably priced way of getting them here. Oh well, it's not like I need any more soap.

In a good way though if that makes sense. Anyway, today's gonna be a good day. Even if I'm at work for 12 hours playin in piss today.

The smell off the puck is clean, sweet, and subtle. Took me a second to dial in the lather, but it performed excellently. Slick is an understatement; my razor glided around my face with ultimate ease. I'm still a bit partial to the bison tallow base, but I'll definitely pick up an Icarus soap once I go through my samples. Can't say enough good things about Taum Sauk, either.

I used one of my gift sets today. Noble Otter's tea is really so good. Oddly it was the last scent of his that I finally tried.\n\nI still think Lone Star is better ([fight me](http://cdn.smosh.com/wp-content/uploads/legacy.images/smosh-pit/032011/come-4.jpg)) but the tea is a very close second.\n\nI realized today I haven't reached a for a sub- 6/8 razor but maybe once or twice, all month. I'm definitely a fan of the larger razors. The smaller blades are fine, but something about the 6/8+ size works for me.\n\n[Happy Friday errbody.](https://thumbs.gfycat.com/InbornHappygoluckyAnole-max-1mb.gif)",

Going through the samples I'd received, I wanted to start today with a familiar scent but still try something new, so I used a Voskhod blade (still have Astra Platinjm to try later). With 3 days growth, my skin had healed up fine from the last shave, and using with the Icarus base I had no issues with the Voskhod. Felt pretty good afterward, and used just a little of the Millesime Imperial sample I recently picked up as the salty ocean air notes worked well with the Shore scent to my nose.\n\nLooking forward to trying the soap samples next, and DEFINITELY looking forward to trying out the delicious new Small Batch Winter Reserve bay rum AS from Derby City Chop Shop (a local bourbon-infused bay rum, or should I say bay bourbon, by the smell of it). Thanks /u/Hyvasuomi79 for the recommendation, I will enjoy my batch #36/75!\n\nToday is a good day.",

The scent notes are spearmint and eucalyptus with added menthol. My grandfather always had spearmint growing by the front door of the house and one of my strongest sense memories from childhood is picking the leaves off of those plants to chew and just to crumble up in my hands to smell. This soap totally nails the spearmint scent and, as an added bonus, produces a cold frosty lather that chilled my skin nicely in anticipation of a hot summer day. As always, the Creeper AS provided a nice lasting chill with a mouth-watering hit of citrus goodness.\n\nCan we get Shannon's Soaps on TryThatSoap so I can add it to my den and rate it? Also, how about a feature to allow folks to share a link to their den for bragging purposes? kthanx!",

I enjoy floral and fruity scents. I expected this to be a fruity and floral scent, and it is, but at the same time it's not. The base notes pull it strongly back in the other direction. The result is a scent that has multiple levels and would likely be enjoyable for just about anyone. The rose note also really opens up nicely when lathered although again, is well balanced.\n\nPerformance wise, again, this soap delivers. This was the second soap I've tried in /u/olympiawest's premium base. It definitely holds its own against other $20+ bases out there. It offers excellent sickness and leaves your face feeling awesome.\n\nDon't miss out on this one!",

For me, the Bufflehead samples were the holy grail since I have a hard time paying bazaar prices for unobtanium with which I have zero experience.\n\nFirst, I loved the smell of Fletcher coming off the sample and it only got better as the lather built. The lather itself didn't look or feel extraordinary, but it did provide good slickness and excellent cushion. I could hardly feel the razor on my face.\n\nI'm looking forward to trying a couple more of the Bufflehead scents in the sample batch to see how the base performs across multiple iterations. After one shave, I still don't think I'd pay $10/ounce for this soap, but I could see myself trying to get in on a drop at MSRP.",

This razor is good. Real good. I've never had such an easy shave before. Cleans ups were minimum, and it was easier getting my trouble spots around my adams apple. I didn't cut, or nick myself. It was just as smooth as it can be.\n\nAlso, I went from 30 minutes shaving. To about 10 minutes.\n\nI was born in 1992, my first experience with shaving was with a Gillette Fusion in 2007 or 2008. I think the problem was all those blades on the razor, because 2 worked just fine, and I had no redness, or irritation like I got from the Fusion.\n\nNow, I can get similar results with a DE in about twice the time. Will this razor replace my safety razor? Probably not. But I do like the Sensor much more than the Trac II, the pivoting head makes such a difference.\n\nI wish blades weren't so expensive because it really is a good razor.\n\nI hope you guys don't hate me too much. Have a great day!",

With Austere August right around the corner, I want to get all the possible variety I can haha. We all know how wonderful the WK ass milk base is. I'd forgotten how thirsty it is though and severely overloaded my brush. The scent is a nice fern, the likes of which I hadn't ever smelled. The lemon and the basil really pushed forward for me, but in a mellow presentation. And the synthetic menthol was a fantastic addition.",

Rodgers & Sons \"Matchless\" 11/16 FH\n**Post:** Lucky Tiger - Oil of Olay Complete\n\nSo I have a cream sample that is in the final stages of development. I was kindly asked to give it a try. It is hard, and unfair, to give a review of a product after one use. But I will state my very first impressions. This cream has a look and consistency that is very similar to Baum.be. That is to say it is very soft, truly a cream. I took a dollop slightly smaller than a pea and put it in a wet, but not dripping brush. It made lather quite easily. I worked it quite a while to get a feel for it and was surprised to find that it has a wider tolerance for water than I expected...wider than Baum.be but not as wide as Castle Forbes. I kept working in water and it took it very well. The slickness is very good. I don't comment on \"cushion\" as this metric holds no meaning for me. I am known for making lather that is thinner than most folks here. In other words, I don't do lather porn. The protection is in the slickness. This cream has plenty of it. I do a 4 pass shave with a straight every day. I could have used a little more product for the final pass, but it was a good way to get a feel for the slickness. My final pass was almost all water with just a hint of cream mixed in. It was still slick enough for a comfortable pass with zero irritation.\n\nNow let's talk about post shave feel. Some of you may know that I am cursed with extremely dry skin. Nearly all soaps dry my skin out. Some way more than others. A few like Declaration (bison and Icarus), Wholly Kaw (donkey milk), Barrister & Mann Reserve & Stubble Buster actually dry my skin very little if at all. This cream is at that level. My skin feels great. And the feeling is sustained long after I have shaved. This is a good sign. A very good sign. I need a few more shaves with it with it to make a definitive judgment, but I am very impressed with the first use. I will use different types of brushes and different razors in the coming days to get a more rounded opinion.",

It's mostly Executive parts except for the baseplate. Set the gaps myself and it shaves like a dream. So incredibly smooth on settings 5 and 6.\n\nThe soap is the real star here. I get a predominantly sweet smelling hay. The dirt is behind the hay and the cedar I can barely detect. To me, it smells like a hayride. We have a few pumpkin patches around here during Fall and most of these local farms will have people meet at one place then take a hayride out to the actual pumpkin patch. That's what this smells like to me. I let my wife sniff it as well and she immediately said \"dirt\" so who knows, goes to show how subjective scent is.\n\nLather was wonderful, as have been all of Summer Breaks offerings thus far. I probably could have used an aftershave but I didn't really want to cover up the scent and did just fine on it's own. Given, to my nose, the sweet/dirty nature of this scent, I think it would pair well with Hallows aftershave or possibly even Bon Vivant.\n\nIf u/rocketk455 ever pushes this (or an iteration) out in the full line I'll for sure be picking up a set.",

As I understand it, the soap was intended for a Nebraska group meetup, but they all went bitch. So I was happy to help out and throw some money at an og reddit artisan. Especially if it helped to punk some fools that tried to piss backwards on a guy *after* he'd already invested his time and materials into making the product they requested.\n\nAnyway, on to the soap. The performance is typical SBS performance, which is very very good.\n\nThe smell on this soap is very interesting. I get the smell of dry hay and dry cedar chips. With the inclusion of \"dirt\" I thought it might be a wet/dirty scent, but it is not.\n\nThis is a surprisingly sweet (not cloying) clean scent, given the notes. I hesitate on the word sweet. The cedar and hay come together and the scent is *crisp*, not mushy or soft like a wet hay bale or soaked cedar wood.\n\nThis is an excellent fall scent, that I could absolutely see /u/rocketk455 running seasonally, with great success. ([hints courtesy of ACME](https://i.imgur.com/OxsSsv3.gif).)\n\nSince SBS and I have a history together, and I [fucking rock at developing scent ideas and naming them](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/8tyedh/z/e1bjufy) I humbly suggest this new soap be christened:\n\n[Roll in the hay](https://media.tenor.com/images/759011f9dc437e0dfc5c3d48eb6892d6/tenor.gif)\n\n\n>> Head for the practice football field and dip behind the hay bales. The sweet scent of hay mingles with the cedar planks of the jv equipment shed as she rounds the corner.\n\n>>Yeah, sure you **should** be in European History right now. But cutting class for a *Roll in the Hay* is a lot more fun.\n\nI'm aware that the artisan is a school teacher, and that all of his scents and names are centered around school related stuff. So we'll just have to assume this is a Catholic school or something. I don't care. Just make it happen.",

The E plate feels a lot like the D plate, but I did have 2 full days growth compared to my typical D plate shaves so far (1 day). Dissect that however you think appropriate. I have to be especially careful applying lite to no pressure when buffing sensitive areas with the D and E to avoid irritation. But given decent technique I don't think you'd have to worry about cutting yourself with these. I have nicked myself with the D plate, being careless while buffing. This handle might be my top pick for the Karve, very well balanced.\n\nCologne Russe is so nice, and as I explore all the Barrister and Mann soaps, I have come to understand why Will is such a killer. I want to buy every scent I've tried so far (except petrichor, just not for me).\n\nBBS today.\n\n\n",

I don't see anybody around mentioning they have one, but I hope that changes. Great in the hand, awesome weight. It's too early to say it's my favorite brush to use, but it's definitely my favorite to look at. First one with the soap, too. I think I added too much water as I went. The lather was alright and very slick, but not as thick as I'm used to. I know it's not the brush because I test lathered it about 6 times before I used it on my face. The splash was surprisingly mentholated. I wasn't expecting that at all and as such I'm not a huge fan.",

Sometimes keeping the kids in line and getting chores done makes one feel like a disciplined sea captain, brandishing a cat-o-nine-tails and ready to face the Kraken that waits in the distance. With this in mind, my Sunday afternoon shave included the most striking of soaps from my recent PIF, Southern Witchcrafts' Arcane Abyss.\n\nThis was very interesting; the smell from the sample container is clearly the same scent as from the lather and post-shave, but expressed very differently. My family was surprised when I revealed this was the same scent on my face and remaining on the brush vs their first time smelling from the jar. The lather scent is an intoxicatingly dark, brooding and smooth aquatic, and very aptly named in my opinion. I got a smooth shave from the 2nd use of the Voskhod blade, and with a frozen alum block, witch hazel, Trader Joe's face lotion and finally Chiseled Face Tradewinds, I felt and smelled ready to take any challenges on the high seas.\n\nToday was a good day.",

I dunno, I'm enjoying it, but actually I find my Timeless and 6S to be more comfortable. Still efficient, and I got DFS after 3 passes. Left some light stubble on one side of my neck that I left to avoid razor burn. The Karve has solved some problem spots for me but left new ones.. lol. I think I just might need to finesse my technique a bit more. I'm not sure if I should aim for a bump up or down in efficiency, so I might order the B and D plates at some point.\n\nThis is my first WK set and it's just lovely. Thirsty af with slickness and post shave feel thru the roof. The scent is well done, and I'm very happy they now have this EO-only offering.\n\nMy next shave will be as a groomsman from a hotel in Bali. Have a great week, you jerks!",

This time I used a brown horse hair brush. I needed to use more product with this brush than I did with a synthetic brush. That is pretty much normal though. If you are looking for a lather that you can set your coffee cup on and not sink to the bottom, this ain't it. What it is, though, is a very nice and slick lather that is easy to shave with. I have been informed that this can also be used as a brushless cream. I don't see myself using it in this manner though. The post shave feel is again the quality that stands out the most for me. It is exceptional for my extremely dry skin. My face feels very supple. No irritation or razor burn at all. Tomorrow I will use a boar brush to see how the cream behaves with that.\n\nAn interesting work week begins.",

      "body": "Soap: Abbate y la Mantia Isaaco\n\nBrush: Dogwood Timberwolf\n\nRazor: Rockwell 6c\n\nBlade: Perma Sharp\n\nPost: Thayer's Witch Hazel; Lucky Tiger balm\n\nWell, I have a confession to make today. It all started on [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/90zmcm/video_review_xpost_buttero_from_abbate_y_la/e2uefr6/). I am not a fan of Tcheon Fung Sing soaps, and didn't think based on the 4 or 5 variations of the TFS soaps I've tried that I would be able to get along with Abbate y la Mantia soaps, which I knew were also produced by TFS. Enter /u/Cadinsor, who I knew based on his videos was a big fan of AYLM products. He generously offered to send me some samples, and I got those last week. For the past 3 days, I've used AYLM soaps in my shave, and I can say they are excellent. There, /u/Cadinsor, are you happy now???\n\nDon Jose: notes of banana, coconut and menthol. As with all AYML soaps I've tried so far, the scent is very mild until lathered. Once lathered, the scent really comes out. It's a very refreshing scent, and I was particularly impressed with the fatiness of the soap. It feels extremely moisturizing both during and after the shave.\n\nButtero: I'm not a fan of leather scents, so when I saw this one was leather, I was skeptical. To my surprise, I really enjoyed this one. In fact, of the 4 he sent, this might be my favorite scent of the group. This isn't just any leather--it's [ITALIAN LEATHER](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVSvSbnaUg). It's very smooth, and the name is actually fitting because the scent isn't a rough, rugged leather, it's a buttery smooth leather. Again, slickness was wonderful, and the moisturizing feel of the soap was right up there with some of the best soaps I've used.\n\nIsaaco: today's shave was Isaaco, which is green apple and black fig. The scent is very well done. The apple is tart and sweet, just like you'd expect, and the fig lends a bit of earthiness to ground out the scent. Another great shave today using an AYML product. Note to TFS: please listen to whatever AYLM is telling you to do with its soaps, and emulate it in your other products. Thank you.\n\nSo, /u/Cadinsor. As much as it pains me to admit it, you were correct. These are fantastic soaps.",

Light and variable wind becoming south 5 to 10 mph in the afternoon. High tide at 1:53 this afternoon.\n\nOkay shave with THB-Tangerine Creeper. The dish is small. Almost too small to be able to load the Expanded Sumo from. The aftershave is nice smelling, and pretty much smells like you would expect. The cooling is awesome. And it seems to turn my hands a very pale shade of orange for a little bit after I splash it on. Not sure if I would be able to get the tint with a picture, but to me it's definitely there. Over all I can see what all the fuss is about, but much like a Wolfman there is no way I could justify paying secondary market rates for this set. Hell, I shouldn't justify spending what I did on it, but I did, and I did with my FOMO acting up.\n\nHave a nice Monday everyone!",

I know that it's not specified whether or not you can use a preshave oil and, even though I only use it on the beard that I don't shave, I want to try to keep with the idea of austerity and do away with it temporarily. After the shave, the beard was a bit harder to tame but I got it in line enough to go to work. As for the shave itself, it was a fantastic shave from a fantastic product! I'm honestly loving the hell outta the smell of the aftershave. It doesn't completely perfectly match the scent of the soap, but I think that's a good thing this time. It's a really nicely compliment to the soap's scent and I'm excited to see how long this warm and spicy scent stays with me today. Happy Monday gents!",

Today's shave was effortless with the GEM. One tiny weeper that had sealed up by the end of the third pass, and that was it. This is the same blade I was using last week (lost count of the shaves on it), and it plowed through three days of growth with no problem.\n\nI just love the bison tallow base. I'll probably try to get my hands on some Icarus at some point in the near future. Y'all say it's better, but I can't really see how it could get much better than this. I did some quick cleanup after my third pass with just the residual slickness and a little water on my face. No problems at all.\n\nI grabbed the Toner because the matching Splash was out of stock everywhere. I do miss the alcohol burn, but my face feels so good right now I don't really care. The scent is so good. It's definitely Colonia-esque but there some extra green smells in there that I really like. Almost foo-gee-air like, but with that strong bitter citrus. I'm interested to see how this ages on my skin today.\n\nHappy Monday y'all!",

Soupla parties on Saturday and then spent all day with my GF walking our dog around the city and different parks to socialize the pups. Then we went out to eat on the patio with her. It was untrusting, but I'd call it a tentative success overall, which is sweet!\n\nInteresting SOTD today. I always love going back to Lavanille. In fact, it is another one of my top 3 favorite scents! Went back to this one right before Austere August begins because this shave commemorates my [Auster Summer 2017](https://imgur.com/a/NCtjAwY) when I dedicated myself to finishing up my first tub of Lavanille. It took a lot longer than I thought it would, but as soon as the tub was done I had another one in the mail!",

(Soap is a sample pressed in a Maggard Jar)\n\nMy shoulder was hurting, so didn't want to do my long ass lathering procedure. Ended up with a decent lather. Then dropped the brush in the sink with water running after the first pass. So much for not lathering - had to go back to the sample.\n\nFresh KAI blade in a razor which I am liking but not loving. After my regular 3 passes, expected quite a bit of alum sting, but didn't get that much.\n\nFinally, forgot to put on any aftershave. This soap isn't the best for my skin plus the alum - I really have a dry and itchy skin now. Wish I had a bottle of AS in my office - NEW purchase idea!!",

I love barbershop soaps, so this one rings all of my bells. It is a little powdery, but not overly so. It lathers up very easily-maybe easier than anything else I own. It has a great slickness and I feel like I could go for another pass even after all of the lather is gone. I paired it up with Seville-another favorite. I didn't order the aftershave when I bought the soap and I regret that and need to rectify that immediately. Summer Break soaps are outstanding. What a great time to be a wet shaver. We have all of these new artisans popping up with these excellent soaps and the existing artisans keep upping their game. This will be one of my more frequently used soaps going forward and is in early consideration for Austere August.\n\n[bad picture day picture ](https://imgur.com/gallery/bRT1KgJ)",

I wish I could find blades for this as inexpensively as DE blades.\n\nAbout 3 years ago when I first started wet shaving I started off with soap samples, one of those samples was OG Panty Dropper, I remembered I liked the scent but when I wanted to buy a full tub, but the scent was discontinued.\n\nIm glad it's back. I don't remember what the old stuff smelled like but this new one smells great! Similar to Drakkar Noir but a little sweeter, and a bit powdery to my nose. I really enjoy it. I'm also really glad that the pin-up girl stayed on the label, I love all things rockabilly.",

It's citrusy with a hint of bitterness, really good.\n\nI decided to swap back from my Feather back to the Muhle blades I used before and the shave isn't as close as it was before and a bit more irritable.

This stuff is just flat out awesome! Obviously the performance is truly top notch, but what blew me away most was the scent. I love love love this scent /u/whollykaw just nailed it. its just such so beautiful and fresh. I would buy Colonel Conk if it smelled like this. The synthetic menthol is a fantastic bonus as well. It pairs well with the scent and makes for a cold, but comfortable shave. This is one of those rare soaps that makes me want to buy a back up.\n\nPre: Proraso White pre shave cream\n\nLather: WK Fern Concerto\n\nBrush: Wolf Whiskers B5\n\nRazor: Ever Ready Streamline\n\nBlade: GEM PTFE\n\nPost: WK Fern Concerto",

After spreading some Of my B&M Reserve Lavender in my bowl, I also tried adding 2 drops of vegetable glycerin to the bowl prior to loading, to see how it would impact the lather (it did \"boost\" the lather, but the lather strangely got drippy wet very quickly upon face lathering - will have to try testing with other soaps and perhaps testing water hardness/pH also in order to isolate the root cause variable and better understand its effects).\n\nThis was the third use of my first Voskhod blade, and it didn't drag - but it wasn't super smooth either. Think I'll have to try another shave or two with it before testing the other blades to get a better impression. In any case, it was a very mild shave and I erred on the side of less irritation vs BBS; I could still feel some light stubble ATG and in trouble spots, but mostly no redness, so I consider it a successful experiment.\n\nThe verdict: still up in the air whether I could be a daily shaver. I'll try again next week, but so far I've found it's easier to shave aiming for BBS every 2.5-3+ days based on beard growth rate and skin sensitivity. Perhaps I may have a different experience if I do a less aggressive shave after 3+ days, then follow up with daily less aggressive shave; maybe, maybe not. As Nelson Mandela once said, \"I never lose- I either win or I learn.\"",

Henckels 401 11/16 FH\n**Post:** Lucky Tiger - Oil of Olay Complete\n\nFor my third outing with this beta cream I started out with my favorite boar. It did not go well. It did not lather much at all. I went ahead and made my first pass anyway. Surprisingly, there was more than adequate slickness for a good pass. I just didn't like the idea of not having a lather so I switched to a synthetic. Huge difference. I got a nice lather for the next three passes. My initial thoughts on this cream's latitude for water needs revision. While it still was able to take some water with the synthetic brush, the latitude is not as wide as I first thought. That is no slam, just an observation. And since this cream is also intended to be used brushless, it makes sense that it would not need a huge amount of water. As with the first two shaves the post shave feel is outstanding for my dry skin. That post shave feel lasted well into the day yesterday. I have probably two shaves left with this sample. I will try a badger brush tomorrow, but so far it seems like the best brush to use with it is a synthetic.\n\nA crappy day yesterday to start the week. I expect more of the same.",

I always disliked the barber pole on the Atlas handle because if my thumb moved on the handle it would rotate. Idon't have this issue with the Windsor handle. I bought a couple of Maggards handles and an Ikon to try on various heads. I think this is a quality handle. It doesn't quite have the finish of more expensive handles but the knurling is deep, the weight is good, and it performed well. This is a great value.\n\nTrying Hallward's Dream for the first time as well. Scent was nice but not my favorite barbershop. Lathered very easy and quickly but I found the slickness only ok while the cushion was quite good.\n\n\n\nMaybe I'm alone on this here, but I don't totally hate my work.\n",

In fairness, the added ingredients are said to be targeted to longer term skin care benefit in the post shave, so more immediate effects were not the goal. Still a great shave technically, and the scent is fun and original - a bright lime and grapefruit forward set of notes that turn earthy and woody once lathered. (Name means \"Citrus in Summer\").\n\n* Razor: After months of mainly using more expensive and heavier razors, the light and nimble Calypso is a nice change. I had tried the M1 plate over the weekend and realized the R1 works much better for me - consistent BBS with R1 versus DFS of varying quality with M1. The fit and finish on the Calypso is excellent, and the consistency of the shave and careful balance of aggression and efficiency make this a leader in the sub $100 razor category.\n",

I see what the fuss is about now. It lathers like a champ, holds just enough water, and has the cushion and slickness that make shaving enjoyable. I'm just kinda on the fence about the scent. I can't tell if it's a warmer weather or a cooler weather scent. Oh well, either way, it smelled good so I sure ain't complaining!",

Great in the hand, awesome weight and heft to it. I'm so glad I bought it. I used a base I'm a lot more familiar with for round 2 with the brush. Noble Otter this time. I used Oleo last time and I think I over watered it. /u/smallbag Any tips on how much water Oleo needs?\n\nNoble Otter though, my goodness. I'll fight you if you don't think /u/nobleotter 's new base is a top tier base. I lathered from a sample pressed into a bowl. The smell on The Noir Et Vanille is spectacular. I missed the rush on reviews of this when the new base dropped a few months ago, so I'll keep it short and sweet. It's lovely, and I'd be lucky to smell of it every day. I'm going to need a full size set now. I probably should just buy everything Cody makes always.\n\nI'm excited for Austere August!",

I hate birthdays btw. Motion to remove birthdays from societal norms?\n\nI've tried the B5 before, but this is the first one I've owned, and I have to say it's goddamn amazing. This thing is just the absolute *perfect* combination of backbone, scrub, soft tips, splay, etc. (without having tried any of the other BX's, of course).\n\nOnce I started lathering this up (and I went heavy for the first time)...oh...my...god. Seriously. It's fucking *buttery* smooth, and yet it still keeps a good amount of backbone and scrub.\n\nThis thing is a revelation and a damn work of art.\n\n[Here it is after the first lather](https://i.imgur.com/U7EG1iH.jpg)\n\nI swear...they should have sent a poet.\n\nThe Karve was also a first, and someone here graciously loaned it to me (thanks btw!).\n\nThe first shave was a success.\n\nI like the way it looks, I like the way it feels, etc.\n\nMy benchmark at the moment is the Rockwell 6c on R2 with a kai blade. It's not the \"be-all, end-all\" of razors, but it's efficient, smooth, and just works.\n\nI get a very similar type of shave from the Karve with the A plate--if not better--but just like the RazoRock Game Changer it also has a decent amount more blade feel than I was expecting, which I'm not 100% sure if I like or not.",

Stuck with the 25 swirls (though in reality I probably did closer to 30), but it was perfect. I tend to load with a damp but not dripping brush and this worked pretty well for me.\n\nFirst time trying Seville (though I've had the EdT for a couple weeks in preparation for the Reserve set), and it's a beautiful scent. This is the best barbershop scent I've tried yet. It smells a lot like the lather out of the lather machine at my barbershop. I know Will has mentioned it smells a lot like a certain kind, and I wonder if that's what my barber uses.\n\nI've used the Reserve base before, but only in samples. This was my first time doing it straight from the jar. I wonder if it's even going to be possible to kill this soap with as little of it as I use. This soap would be way easier to overload from the jar I think, so the 25-30 swirls seems like a good way to go.\n\nI need to go on a buying hiatus soon... I have enough shave soap to last me for probably two or three years and I only started getting really into wet shaving in April.",

Some of you saw it at Maggard Razors in June. I shaved it off, this morning, with perhaps the harshest DE razor in existence.\n\nWell, harsh may be too harsh a term for what this razor is. It's more like...demanding. And fun. And thrilling. The *Safeless* is a Pre-War Gillette Tech with the safety bars cut off. I made it late last year, but then grew a beard and never got around to testing it out. It's freaking amazing. No bullshit training wheels getting in your way, no nonsense. Just all the blade feel, all the time. The ATG pass was particularly exhilarating.\n\nIt feels strange to not have a beard again after wearing one for so long. My face looks more dopey than I remember. Maybe I'm just getting old. Oh well, I'm sticking with it for a few months. I have soap to kill.\n\nIf you're sleeping on Storybook Soapworks, and/or the Fair Nurse's newest scent (see above), get woke. This base is legit, and there's not a bad scent to be found in the lot. I'd be 100% on board for an EdP of *Hallward's Dream.*\n\nHappy Tuesday, all. Austere August and the fun begin tomorrow.",

The Brush arrived soft, that's never happened with an animal hair brush for me, and I can only imagine it will get better. Full disclosure this is my first really high end badger knot, the others I have on par are some pretty equally dense Masetos and a WCS Silvertip. I also own a bunch of synthetics and a couple boars.\n\nThis thing can make lather out of anything. It's extremely soft, with the perfect amount of backbone *for me*. I was afraid because it's so dense and high quality that it would be a lather hog, that's not the case. In fact this brush gives up lather better than the masetos. That's awesome!\n\nAll around 100 on this thing even though it's a bit pricey. No buyers remorse.\n\n\n**Lather**\n\nWent at the \"bison tallow\" base with a sopping wet brush, which is the absolute right way to come at this stuff. I didn't have that weird pasty, stringy, marshmellowy stuff that I got on my first few uses. Thanks Will for the tip!\n\nI have found the CG lvl2 a tad on the aggressive side but with two days growth, and this lather, it was quite pleasant!\n\n**The Razor**\n\nI realized that a Charcoal Goods Handle I bought in the bazaar is actually a \"magnum\" Hammered Handle. It's weighty, girthy and pairs perfectly with the CG heads. Two pass BBS, being slightly more cautious of the razor - no cuts but slight burn upon splash application. This is like a Karve D or above in aggression, I've now used the E and it's likely most comparable. Rockwell doesn't quite compare on aggression, but perhaps the 6 setting would be similar.\n\n**Splash**\n\nLove love love the amount of menthol in the CL splashes. And it feels like skin food central!",

I use a .67 Wolfman almost exclusively, so this was an interesting change of pace. The first thing I noticed was the weight of this razor. Brass has some heft. I also noticed less blade exposure compared to the Wolfman. While I have had no problem using the WR1 as a daily razor, I could see how the Karve could be a great higher-end razor for a daily shaver. It's pretty smooth without losing too much efficiency. Overall, I can see why people are excited about the Karve.",
