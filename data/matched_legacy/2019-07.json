It was worth the wait. The base is intuitive and easy to load and lather and there's a very decent scent strength on the soap.\n\nThe soap came across as more violet-forward while the splash seemed more tobacco-forward. It's a lovely scent - the violet in particular comes across as very natural and combines really nicely with the tobacco.\n\nParaphrasing u/mammothben horribly - this is a scent that is meant to evoke a sense of appreciating the current moment as it is, because we don't know what adventures await us in the future. Honestly after the whirlwind of the Lather Games, it feels more like the end of adventure. Sitting in the Shire smoking a pipe, reflecting on the adventure that I've returned from, and how lucky I am to have this present moment to sit and consider.\n\nIt feels like a fitting postscript to the games, and a pause before the next adventure.\n\nHave a great Monday everyone!",

I've got a few post-shave options open and I've got penny samples left to use. I intended on using Dirty Prose to finish off that sample, but sadly, there wasn't enough left to form a lather. Worse still, all my said penny samples were left upstairs, and I ~~didn't want to inconvenience myself by going up there after the shower~~ was lazy so I chose this soap. A really good vegan option and one that joins a list of soaps I will buy once I need to buy more soap. INow that the games are done, I thought I'd change up my razor a bit. While I enjoy my current ATT razor, the base plate leaves something to be desired, mostly the lack of holes on the bottom to allow lather to flow through. I bought a set on the bazaar a couple of weeks ago, a really good deal on a 5-piece set, so I'll play around with those options in the coming months and hopefully make a sale with the pieces that no longer work for me. Shave went well, I thought about layering this with some Santal Auster but I wanted to appreciate the scent of the balm standing alone. It's a nice sandalwood scent, far better than something you'd find [from a brand like Cremo.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/c6wdj3/saturday_lather_games_sotd_thread_jun_29_2019/esbuut4?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)\n\nLife is short, shave with good gear.",

Henckels 11/16 QH\n**Post:** Thayers lavender - Oil of Olay Complete\n**Extra Post:** Chattilon Lux skin balm\n\nThis luxury cream base is seriously good. It works really well for me. It makes copious amounts of lather easily with decent tolerance for water.\n\nThis is my first use with a tuxedo knot. It worked pretty good. However, I don't think I can say I prefer a synthetic over a natural brush in spite of the superior lather a synthetic makes.\n\nA new week dawns.",

I'm like, I'm not prepared for this!So begins the fun of getting to some of my new stuff and shaving with whatever I damn well please. It was nice looking through my den and deciding what I'd use based off of nothing but fancy.\n\nI really like the fragrance of Shire. It's not that lawn grassy but more of those wild clover looking grasses. It more sweet and less sharp than some of the other \"grassy\" stuff out there. The tobacco is much more prevalent in the splash but it's also a sweeter type tobacco. Overall it's very fresh and relaxing. I could totally picture the shire smelling like that.\n\nI picked up a [$6 Shavette](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/bwhaKelw) from Ali Express because I liked the wood scales on it. Turns out it's a pretty nice razor so far. Hopefully it's somewhat durable but so far so good. The blade exposure is very minimal and gave a good shave. I'm going to be using it a lot more often to try and master my technique.\n\nI pairing the tobacco in my fragrance with Biblio today. Just got this in the bazaar and looking forward to exploring it. Notes are papyrus, cedar, and tobacco.\n\nI had an amazing weekend and I'm feeling pretty damn good. Have a great week ahead all.",

Never could get that shit to do right for me. The scent was a nice, calm orange and I used Latha Limon that I snagged for the wife forever ago from Maggard's, so I figured that counted. Finished it off with Le Grand Chypre that I also ordered from Maggard's. Still can't honestly say if I like chypres or not, but I can't honestly appreciate them for what they are.\n\nToday's story will be my first decent story of my nursing career. My very first nursing job was in a nursing home and I was green as hell. So the first few days of working, you kinda shadow somebody and follow them through the med pass and how they chart and do all the little stuff. Cool. That was \"supposed\" to happen for 5 shifts I think before they cut me loose. It only happened for 1 because they had a call in, so boom. I was on my own. No biggie. I got this shit. I start at the front of the hall and push that big fuckin cart down the way, stopping and giving pills and doing treatments and shit. I might not be the fastest, but I'm making progress. Cool beans. Goin good. It was the very last patient I had and I knew she needed her pills crushed up and put into applesauce. Ok. No problem. I popped em all out of their little cards and put em in a plastic pouch. Next, I crushed the shit outta them little bitches and dumped em in a medicine cup full and topped em off with applesauce. Gave it all a quick mix with a tongue depressor and off into the room I went. It was a lady in a bed, old as sin, laying there asleep. So I woke her up and introduced myself and told her that I had her meds all ready for her. She asked me real weak-sounding to come closer. Ok. I can do that. I got a bit closer and asked her to open her mouth. She again asked me to come closer. Um ok. I scooted a bit closer. She once again repeated the request. I came a little closer and scooped the medicine out and offered it to her mouth. Keep in mind now, this lady is laying in a special bed that raises and lowers and her body is probably around mid-thigh high on me. Well anyway, as she closes her mouth around the medicine, she reached her right hand out like a mother fuckin snake and grabbed my damn dick y'all. She honestly and literally had her hand wrapped around my cock, through my scrubs, with her fingernails digging into my dick. I hollered out, way louder than I meant to and started asking her to let go of me. I was trying to NOT panic and end up losing my personal tongue depressor. She swallowed her medicine and started smiling and giggling. Nope. Not funny to me goddammit. I tried pulling away. Didn't work. Tried begging nicely. Didn't work. Tried tapping her forearm to make sure she remembered that there's a body attached to the dick. Nope. I ended up having to pry her fingers off one at a time and jumping back before grabbing the medicine cup off the floor and running away like a bitch. I busted out of the room and was greeted by the sight of 4 CNAs and another nurse standing outside the room laughing their asses off. I'll be honest y'all. I lost my shit for a minute. I slung the keys to my med cart on the ground and walked outside and smoked a couple of cigarettes. Really had to make for SURE SURE that this is what I wanted to do with my life. Then I remembered that I had a wife and a kid and bills and shit. So I went back and finished the shift and stayed there for a couple of years. I ended up with four little crescent moon shaped bruised on my shaft that my ex-wife didn't originally believe was from an old lady, but I reminded her that I would never willingly let someone do that to my dick and she backed the hell off.\n\nEdit: Forgot to add this quick tidbit about this lady. She had a bad case of Alzheimer's and would masturbate frequently while in bed and screaming her deceased husband's name. It wasn't unusual to hear the name \"Teddy\" being yelled out at the end of the hall. You pretty much knew to just let her finish before you went in there. I totally don't miss the nursing homes y'all. Not at all.",

USE ME!\" I won't go into base particulars. But the scent is great. I get mostly a bright citrus with some deep scents. Try That Soap and Declaration Grooming have knocked it out of the park again with a data-driven soap. All the notes combine into a beautiful symphony of smell. It starts off bright and citrusy, like you're picking oranges fresh off the tree. Then it shifts to something a bit darker, like you wandered in to the forest that happened to border the orange grove, it's dark, and just a little bit green. It's a very nice scent.\n\nHave a nice Monday everyone!",

A liberating feeling to chart my own daily shaving destiny once again! But the river of lather is not the same, nor am I the same shaver...\n\n**Lather**: What is a \"saeryan\" anyway? The internet [provides no ready answer](http://paulsbods.blogspot.com/2018/06/medieval-citizens-i-valdemar.html?_sm_au_=iVVWnq6DnSkQ6F35).\n\nThe scent is pretty unique, petitgrain, a dry bitter citrus and violet, a spicy floral. There's also some hops noticeable to me, along with bergamot and clover that I can't detect.\n\nOverall, this reminds me of Grey Flannel but with more petitgrain, less florals and woods, and with none of the fougere trappings like oakmoss and coumarin. (So then, really not that much like Grey Flannel...). Definitely a Spring scent, but works well enough on this summer day.\n\nB&M always does neat things with violet, and this is no exception. Performance was at the highest level.\n\n**Blade:** Another two pass BBS from the very reliable Polsilver. Feels like we can easily hit ten shaves here...\n\n**Frag:** Believe the hype - an aquatic for aquatic haters, a summer scent that has complexity and uniqueness. Admiral is the cat's pyjamas, and CL is now in the catbird seat with this release.",

I missed several days where I either just forgot to post the SOTD or I did not shave altogether. And the Summer Break day was one of those. So I am making it up today. I love Summer Break Soaps and I really, really like Bell Ringer. It is a nice citrus scent and I generally enjoy those. And the lather is great. My skin is a damn mess between Lather Games over-shaving and allergies, so the shave was less than wonderful and I am apparently revisiting my teenage years with some weird pimples under my chin that shouldn't be ingrown hairs but just might be. In any case, I will still have three or four days here of lather game make up days before I get back to my regular scheduled of having no damn idea what I am going to shave with.",

Time for me to get more familiar with my new razor and worry less about repeating artisans.\n\nOverall a good shave this morning. Got a very nice lather with the Mammoth soap. There was almost no detectable scent off the puck, but as soon as I got in there with a wet brush, I got the smell of standing in a sunny meadow. Lots of green grass and a bit of bright citrus. I did end up with a couple weepers on my neck today. Nothing a quick touch of the styptic pencil couldn't fix. I'm assuming I moved a bit too fast with the Wolfie. I'll take it a little slower next time. Tomorrow I may not even shave at all. What a crazy idea.",

I'm no menthol head by any means but it's definitely welcomed from time to time to cool down from the heat (and I must hate myself more than usual to do a few back to back menthol shaves).\n\nI started the week off with Barrister and Mann's Terror which is supposed to be a replacement for Arctique. The scent notes are frankincense, cold water and peppermint. It smells pleasant off the puck and is fantastic in the Excelsior base. The synthetic cooling kicks in immediately when face lathering and delivers a consistent cooling effect throughout the shave. You can definitely feel a strong cooling effect but it didn't feel as painful as Arctique, and the biggest benefit is that it did not have me in tears.\n\nThe aftershave in the Deltus base is amazing. It absorbs quickly and left my face feeling great. The aftershave delivered another dose of cooling but just like the soap, it did not sting my face. This is my second shave with Terror and I remember the cooling effect lasted quite awhile last time so I'm expecting the same again.\n\nWith the first shave in the books I'm planning to alternate the rest of the week between menthol and synthetic soaps. I'm planning on the following shaves: B&M Arctique, NO Orbit, CF Cryogen and SBS Cannonball. I only have soap samples of Cryogen and Cannonball so I won't be able to compare the aftershaves, but the soap itself should give me a good indicator of the cooling. I'm also looking forward to those two as well since I have not tried them out before.\n\nI'm also thinking of throwing in B&M's Reserve Cool at the end of this all even though the soap does not contain menthol but the aftershave does. This is more of a treat at the end to wind down a week of menthol shaves. I don't have any other soaps that I can think of that contain menthol but these are plenty enough.",

It's just the stress of figuring everything out, making sure it's right, trying to come up with decent write ups and posting them every single day....whew. It's just nice to have the freedom again. I was actually looking forward to not shaving today and it was glorious! Spritzed on some Chatillon Lux Rose Santal after my shower and out the door.\n\nEven though I'm glad the Games are over, I'm super happy that I completed the challenge to the best of my ability, prizes or not. I'm almost looking forward to Austere August after this overload of variety. Happy shaving (or not shaving) all!",

That's the way I'm sure many of us Lather Gamers felt today.\n\nI tried a new-to-me vintage Gillette NEW today and was very pleased that it handled even the old Nacet. And trying another scent from Wild West as well. Turns out maybe to be my fav scent from them!\n\n#### ❧ Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Gillette - NEW Flat Bottom Round Pin Knurled - UK ::: Gillette - Nacet ‹152 uses›)*\n\nA little tugging on this old blade, but otherwise shave went very well. Close result. No irritation.\n\n#### ❧ Soap Notes\n*^(Wild West Shaving - Bonnie & Clyde)*\n\nThem: Leather, Campfire, Wild Honey\n\nScent: Pretty true to it's description. The leather was the strongest, and the campfire was next. Sometimes burning wood can overpower a scent, but this one is done just right, where you still get a good feel for it. Honey was very much in the background, and probably served to temper the two harsher notes.\n\nI really enjoyed this scent!\n\nScent Strength: 5/10, nicely present during shaving.\n\nLather: Performance was very good. slick and creamy. A watery slickness, not buttery or fatty. Rinses easily. This one is not top tier, but a close second in my book. Beautiful lather, too. Very enjoyable.\n\n* 1/4- tsp soap\n* lightly-wet big badger brush\n* 3.5 tsp water\n* = 5 passes of lather.\n\nBowl - I used the XL version of this bowl:\nhttps://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3392930\n\n#### ❧ Brush Notes\n*^(Elite Razor - Manchurian Fan CravingShaving Blue/White 26mm‹9 uses›)*\n\nGot along better with this brush today. I finally acknowledged that this brush is just too tough to keep in splay (and it pushes my face around anyway). so I just focused on the tips and had a good experience. Not the softest tips, but still soft, providing a good feel that was enjoyably massagey.\n\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Just a little tugging\n*Neck*: Just a little tugging\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Very Close Shave\n*Neck*: Few hairs are showing some tip length (with most being cut flush)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm) *and also in the sub's sidebar.*\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

Without the lather games to wake me up, why would I bother? Life... she is now without purpose, non?\n\nI've heard for ages that Rive Gauche / PAA CaD / Fine American Blend / RazoRock American Barber / Gillette Barbershop Fresh are all based on the original Barbasol scent so I figured it was time to educate myself and try out the great grand-daddy of them all, the venerable Barbasol.\n\nFuckin' yuck guys. That shit sucked.\n\nPerformance was awful. Scent was weak and unappealing. Nothing was enjoyable about it. I went back to my drawer of D-grade shave supplies and pulled out a can of Gillette gel for the second pass and it was a vast improvement in every way imaginable.\n\nSo now I'm torn. After ShaveScore Saturday I thought, \"dang dudes I should buy some Fine American Blend since everybody here loves the stuff\" but after trying that Barbasol and being so let down by the scent... I'm not so sure any more. Can y'all folks sell me on the FAB scent so I can justify buying it? Please. Be my angel. Enable me.",

It continues to surprise me that this combination works well, but... I'll take it!\n\nFirst time using the pineapple handle I got from BST on this razor and I really like the grip I'm getting a lot better.\n\nWith the hardness of the water here, Stirling soaps is still hit and miss for me. Saturday's lather was really thin, even with the same brush/soap combination, but today's provided more cushion. Maybe it's my technique but for the cost and effort, there are other soaps that I can get consistently good lather. Almost at the end of the sample puck.\n\nBBQ with some friends today, so I'm getting my place all cleaned up (been a bit of a slob while I was busy the last week). Excited for fireworks tonight.\n\nHappy Canada Day to my fellow Canadians! 🇨🇦",

Finally came back mid afternoon, got some work done, and i'm now joining the evening shave crew. I finally got around to picking up a Wholly Kaw Vegan soap. I'm a fan of LFP, but since I don't do lanolin, I don't have the soap. Been meaning to grab this forever. I shouldn't be due to the WK rep, but I was very impressed. Took a *ton* of water, more than i'm personally used to in the soaps I generally reach for, so it took me a long time to get it right since I was adding slowly since I was afraid of drowning it. This is what I mean by 'hard to lather'.....for me. Since I usually use soaps that don't need a ton of water and whip up quick using a wet brush, something like this took me some time. It's alright, I had the time this evening!\n\nI have no clue what i'm going to use tomorrow, but i'm gonna let Gonzo on IRC pick for me. He's never wrong, you know.",

I have to push the soap from the edges to the middle. Razor + blade felt a bit rough because of the airy lather. Mild and slightly chilling post shave to wrap it up.\n\nI'm going to try the Zenith brush again. I keep having bad lathers with it and I'm hoping that it's not the brush. Anyways, still enjoyed the shave regardless. Still waiting for Maca Root cream so excited for that! Although I'd love to try it, I'm going to try to 3017 the Miami Mojito soap until it is entirely gone!",

It's so good! The EdT has been a favourite for a while so when the soap was announced I decided to get the whole family.\n\nThe soap itself is a bit sweeter and chocolatey than the splash and EdT but I'm guessing that's the soap base I'm smelling. This is also the first Icarus soap I've owned and it gave a great shave, once you've given it enough water it's so slick and smooth.\n\nIt needs a few more uses as it may just be initial excitement but I can see this becoming one of my favourite shaves.",

Been a while. So I tried a Feather blade for the first time in what seems like years and, holy fuck, they're good shavers. I remember Feathers being kinda harsh in the past but I think it's a combination of an improvement of my technique and the mildness of the Blue Tip. The Feather blade seems to mellow out after a few shaves and can be a little tuggy but still gives be a smooth shave with no irritation even after the seventh shave. Orgasmic. Facegasmic.",

First order of business, though, was trying out Unconditional Surrender this morning. I've had a sample of the EdT and enjoyed it. It's one of those scents that I keep meaning to try the soap of and I keep damn forgetting. Well, I'm an idiot for waiting this long. I really enjoyed the experience of the scent from start to finish with the shave today. I really got more of the tobacco note from the soap and especially the toner than I do from the EdT. I think I caught a bit of vetiver in the background and some kinda floral but I'm not sure what right now. I think that I'll be setting this aside for the fall though. I'm trying to get a decent rotation of seasonal-ish scents here and this just really smells like fall to me. That's not a bad thing. It just is. Still thoroughly enjoying it and, of course, the bison tallow base of the soap was phenomenal. Can't say too much about post shave feel because I immediately followed it with the toner. I love the way the toner makes my skin feel, but I'm still addicted to the sting of the alcohol based splashes.",

Now I need to go through them all and figure out which ones should go in the trash, which ones I should just use up, and which ones I might want to add to my collection in full bottles. SO! Last night I went through my list of all my samples, then made a list of everything I already own that might be similar to one of the samples, sorted all of that into rough fragrance families, made a guess as to which ones were the most similar to each other based on foggy recollections, and then strung them all into one long sequence of fragrances to try. It's not quite a perfect spectrum of scent... there's a few road bumps and abrupt turns along the way... but it'll get the job done. And hey, as long as I'm planning my next 31 days of fragrance, why not soaps as well? Hmm, this feels strangely familiar...\n\nMy lather today is B&M's Le Grande Chypre, another /u/RuggerRigger sample that I chose for myself from his collection. My first impression triggered memories of visiting \"local artisan\" markets in Portland Oregon in the early '90s, where (for some odd reason) there always seemed to be *a lot* of incense and patchouli. Funny that. There's a bit of fruit to add freshness in this stuff but it mostly smells like a patchouli incense to my nose.\n\nToday's fragrance is one of my favorites: ApH Silver Black / Onyx. I've talked about it a few times before. Tart fruity opening, a bit of spicy, smokey woody heart with some floral hints, and a woody, leathery, musky drydown. Really effing classy. Sort of like if you were trying to make something in the style of Aventus, but mostly using green colored things: lime, bergamot, and apple up top; juniper, cardamom, basil, and geranium for a spicy woody floral heart instead of birch, rose, and jasmine for a sweet woody floral; and the same musky / patchouli / mossy drydown with leather and Sandalwood instead of ambergris. I'm wearing it today to refresh my memory and establish a good frame of reference for tomorrow's fragrance.",

It amazes me that BPT knows all this cools stuff about the history of perfume and aims to honor prior eras in current designs.\n\nThe scent here is very unique - the brand has returned to vetiver in a big way, but yet it is a very \"decorative\" vetiver, that is very polished and smooth. The hint of greenness and the powdery vanilla interact with complexity, while the floral notes give a lush backdrop to the main show.\n\nShould also be noted that after the dolts at USPS lost my original shipment of East Egg, B&M got a free replacement out the very same day I emailed them on the situation. Great customer service as well as a creative and excellently performing soap.\n\n**Blade:** The Pol feels a tad harsh today - this is the only DE I would trust for ten shaves, but it looks like it's time for a change.\n\n**Post:** Baker Street complements East Egg nicely, having a similar \"historical\" vibe, though aiming for the Victorian period rather than the Roaring 20s of East Egg. The Stirling balm is a reliable bargain.\n\n**Brush:** Another reliable performer, though not really a bargain. The firmed up three band is an odd and currently uncommon creature, but may one day return to prominence as the softer face feel (compared to a two band) still has much appeal. The Shavemac here has aged well, and its moderate bloom makes it look considerably bigger than its stated diameter. The handle is nice enough, but dirt dull off white resin in its materials, ho hum.\n\n**Frag:** Huh, this CL guy keeps knocking them out of the ballpark! I don't get much Miles Davis from this scent, but the Egyptian theme is unique and noticeable. A kind of honeyed spicy floral that really does smell like the sort of polished niche work that normally sells for $75 an ounce. Shh, don't tell CL!",

It was last offered in the glissant base and has a simple scent of floral black pepper, peppermint and menthol.\n\nYou can smell the menthol off the puck and it continues to intensify when lathering. The cooling effect from the menthol began within 30 seconds and ramped up as I face lathered. I can deal with the stinging cold on my face but the scent from the menthol reached my sinuses and eyes. Needless to say, it had me in tears and blowing my nose throughout the shave.\n\nThe aftershave delivered another punch of menthol at the end which intensified the cooling effect but began to dissipate within a few minutes.\n\nI wasn't really thinking of ranking the soaps in terms of coldness but if I had to choose only based on the ones I've used for this week of menthol and cooling, I'd go with Terror in the number one spot due to the longevity of the cooling effect and Arctique in second place due to the menthol effect resulting in tears and snot spewing down my nose.\n\nAlso a quick update from yesterday's shave. I can't remember if Will posted it or if I read it here in one of the comments but the synthetic cooling agent used in Terror, specifically in the aftershave, remains on your hands for quite awhile even if washed off with hand soap. I made the mistake of scratching near the corner of my eye a few hours after my shave and immediately felt a cooling effect where I had scratched. It didn't last long since only trace amounts of the cooling agent remained but that heightened my awareness of what I was doing with my hands the rest of the day.",

Got more of a creamy lather and I am realizing that I need to load this brush so much more than I did with my Synthetic brushes.\n\nGot a good shave, but I fear that I might be reaching the end of this blade. Going to switch back to the synthetic tomorrow to judge if the tugging is blade based or lather based. I'd love to join the club, but I'm not going to push it for another month if the blade needs swapped. I'm super pumped I found a blade that I can rock out Austere August with though. Looking forward to completing the Nightmare level this year.\n\nHappy Tuesday!",

Face was a little sore, but I powered through. The new Zingari Tribe. Scent is I believe either a dupe of, or inspired by, Le Labo 26. Off the puck, the soap is one of the more \"perfumey\" soaps i've used off the top of my head, definitely different. There's a light sandalwood thing going on, lighter than most sandalwood soaps I own. But, the scent isn't the star of the show here, it's the soap. This is the new and improved Zingari base. I didn't have much of a problem with the old base, to be honest. Nevertheless, I see the attraction of the soap, it's very slick, and takes gallons of water as all the hot new soaps do and people seem to like. It wasn't as hard for me to dial in as the Wholly Kaw Vegan was yesterday, but it also wasn't as easy as the previous Zingari base or Southern Witchcrafts.\n\nI guess I should get on board with the soaps that take gallons of water, eh? Seems to be the way everyone is going for that top $have$core.\n\nSince I knew the soap was of the scent of le labo santal 26, I also grabbed a small sample of the EDT. I like it. Le Labo does a nice job with their samples at great prices. The scent of the EDT is definitely more pronounced than in the soap, the soap actually mutes some of the sandalwood that I like. A little perfumey for me but nice to have if the mood strikes. Santal Auster still king of the mountain for me in Sandalwood scents.",

It's been 45 minutes and I can still feel the last vestiges of the synth-menthol, I quite enjoy that.

Didn't care for it then, I suppose because of lack of scent, but I wanted to try it again, since my nose has changed since then... and I've sampled a lot of sandalwoods since then too.\n\n#### ❧ Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Gillette - NEW Raised Flat Bottom UK No. 77? ::: Gillette - Nacet ‹153 uses›)*\n\nSome tugging during this one, but nothing a man can't handle.\n\nVery nice on pass 2 & 3 though, and gave me a great shave despite first pass shave discomfort.\n\nAnd the funny thing is that it's still sharp enough to give me great results! Even in my trouble spot.\n\nAnd no irritation, just the tugging on the first pass.\n\n#### ❧ Soap Notes\n*^(Stirling - Sandalwood)*\n\nJust too weak to enjoy during the shave. Very hard to find it. A big disappointment to me, since SW is my favorite scent, and Stirling is one of my favorite makers.\n\nScent: a sweet sandalwood\n\nScent Strength: 2/10, not really present during shaving.\n\nVery good creamy, slick lather today. Just the viscosity I like. Excellent performance.\n\nI love how this lather gets so elastic when hydrated the way I like it. Takes a lot of water, but still gives creamy feel to face.\n\nThis time, I intentionally used more soap than usual, because i wanted to make sure that I gave the scent a good chance to make himself known.\n\n* 1/4+ tsp soap\n* 5 tsp water to build the lather\n* = 6 passes of lather\n\nBowl - I used the XL version of this bowl:\nhttps://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3392930\n\n#### ❧ Brush Notes\n*^(Whipped Dog - Boar 30mm‹3 uses›)*\n\nThis brush, with so few uses, is already a joy to lather with. It splays easily, but still has enough backbone to keep the tips on your face for a good feel. Tips haven't split yet, but it is still vvery comfortable. Already a terrific brush.\n\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Just a little tugging\n*Neck*: Just a little tugging\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Cut flush to where I just see the tips (above average for me)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm) *and also in the sub's sidebar.*\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

I bought this soap off of Amazon to see if I would like it. Honestly it isn't that bad but I for the same price I'd rather get an artisan brand that is better quality. The soap lathered really well and provided a decent cushion but was a little lacking in the slickness. The new razor performed really well and as I saw in a lot of the reviews, it has a lot of audible feedback. I really enjoy the weight of the handle and the deep knurling.",

As much as I love BBS-1 razor, it is terrible for removing heavy growth like I had, so a razor change was in order. Seeing as it's been almost a week, I figured my skin may be a little sensitive to the razor. When in question of what razor is going to have the correct aggression level, use an adjustable! So I did!\n\nAwesome shave today with a known performing setup, I just couldn't go wrong!\n\nHappy Tuesday!",

It's a sort of outdoors-y, green tobacco scent, as the label suggests. It's moderately scented - it's detectable, but it doesn't last particularly long. It builds a decent lather and a little goes a surprisingly long way.\n\nHerod's tobacco and vanilla goes very well with Semois Valley. I've been enjoying this sample of Herod quite a bit, but not enough to stump up for a full bottle of the stuff given the price.",

This is the second use of this donkey base from WK. I took my time dialing in the lather to find it takes on a decent amount of water and turns into a thick, gooey lather that's a little cream coloured. And it works very well. I don't know if I had an epiphany and I found a better way to use the Karve or the lather just stepped up my game? Who knows but something was very different with today's shave.\n\nAfter the first pass, my face seemed to be on the dry side. I thought the residual slickness was lacking but I think I was just a tad under-hydrated. Once I wet my face and re-lathered, it came together a lot nicer and the residual slickness is there in spades.\n\nThis was last night's shave and my skin is crazy smooth this morning too. I think I could have foregone the splash and still been very happy. This is one base I'm going to consider picking up more of in the future.\n\nHappy (over the) hump day - July long weekends rock!",

Hopefully today we can catch a salamander or snake. Gotta love well run nature parks.\n\nAs far as my blade issue goes, I got a much better lather today with the Timberwolf so I am leaning towards my lather with the new brush being subpar over the blade being used up. Yes it doesn't feel like a fresh blade, but it still does the job and doesn't leave my face feeling like I fought a cheese grater. So on we go, one shave closer to the century club.\n\nHappy Wednesday!",

The blade is called EUROMAX, and on the back, it says \"[EUROSTAR GENERAL TRADING LLC](https://imgur.com/a/JfNwdDF)\". So you would think it's a European product. But it says \"DUBAI - UAE\" right below. And it's \"[Made in India](https://imgur.com/a/xiVuj7x)\". So why it's called EUROMAX and EUROSTAR and is based in UAE and India is beyond me...\n\nHowever, the blade itself is actually pretty darn good. Very smooth and comfortable, although I find that it lacks efficiency. I had to buff a bit more than normal to get to the closeness I'm looking for and does have a bit of tugging, especially on my chin and mustache-area where my facial hair is thicker and denser. Certainly worth a try.",

Much thanks to u/wyz0ne for the Tertius sample he gifted me. First impression of the scent is that it's a very clean and greasy leather scent. Still not too sure about other notes but I think I get a hint of a floral in there. Really great fragrance! The base itself is pretty phenomenal. I tend to gravitate toward artisans that are active in the subreddit, but I kept hearing enough about it that I wanted to try myself. Talk about surprising! I'll definitely be trying to get my hands on some more of it soon. I don't have a leather scented splash, so I followed it up with Cryogen since my damn air conditioning went out yesterday. Gotta try to find somebody that can come by TODAY. It's too damn hot around here y'all. Anyway, I finished it off with Rhino and am pretty pleased overall with the shave today.",

      "body": "**2019-07-03 SOTD: Magical Perfumery Tour - Woody Scents 2/4**\n\n**Razor:** Fatip Piccolo SE (Gentile)\n\n**Blade:** Astra Superior Stainless (shave #6)\n\n**Brush:** Yaqi 24mm Moka Express Synthetic\n\n**Lather:** Barrister & Mann Le Grande Chypre (Glissant base)\n\n**Post:** Skin Bracer by Mennen\n\n**Fragrance:** [Explorer by Montblanc](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Montblanc/Explorer-52002.html)\n\n**Thoughts:**\n\nDay two of roughly 30. I decided to do about two days on each soap. Why? I dunno, just cuz, I guess. Enough to get a first And second impression, since I haven't used some of them in a while (and some I haven't used at all). LGC was pleasant again today and I did a little better lathering it up properly... I got sort of lazy and whiffed it yesterday. I still can't pick out too many individual notes in the scent, so I'll stick with my prior assessment of fresh fruity citrus and patchouli incense.\n\nLast month on ShaveScore Saturday I jokingly gave Stirling's base a bogus \"SpongeScore\" and a few folks indicated that they'd like to see more SpongeScores in the future. Well, truth be told, I *do* keep track of my opinions on all the soaps I try, but my system isn't exactly compatible with the much better known ShaveScore rankings. ShaveScores are based purely on shave performance and post-shave feel and tend to split hairs over which shades of grey are slightly lighter or darker than others. SpongeScores, on the other hand, are much less refined. \"Perfection is the enemy of good enough.\" I don't care if a soap is perfect or not - I just want to know that I can get an easy, reliable, comfortable, and pleasant shave out of it.\n\nOne point is awarded for each question that earns a \"yes\" answer: Is it simple and intuitive to dial in the lather? Is it at least as quick as Cella to lather? Does it offer good primary slickness? Does it offer good secondary slickness? Does it feel lush and protective (instead of thin and watery)? Can I pair it with an alcohol splash in the summer without suffering dry skin and irritation? Can I do the same thing in our brutal winter weather? Is the fragrance appealing to the majority of people I show it to? Is the fragrance strength in the Goldilocks zone - strong enough to enjoy without being overwhelming? Does this soap deserve a bonus point for some aspect that has been unfairly overlooked in the previous nine questions?\n\nMost any soap that earns a passing SpongeScore (5) will provide a serviceable shave with a bit of care and maybe a good aftershave. Most sixes are sort of \"yeah I use it sometimes but I'd rather use something better\" soaps. Sevens are mostly every-day shavers for me. Eights are indulgent and luxurious by my standards. Nines are the sort of stuff that gets saved for special occasions (and so far only 3 soaps have scored a nine). Ten points is the highest score possible and no soap has achieved it yet... so when I say that Le Grande Chypre earns a solid SpongeScore of 8/10, know that this is high praise.\n\nToday's woody fragrance (#2/4) is Explorer by Montblanc. I put it on this morning and my nose went CLICK and the opening smelled different than previous wearings. Today's revised review is as follows.\n\nYou get almost the full composition within minutes of spraying this fragrance, giving you a smoky-sweet bergamot / rosy pink pepper / sage accord sitting on top of a crisp woodsy base of patchouli, vetiver, ambroxan, and \"akigalawood\" which is code for \"refined patchouli extracts.\" The smoky-sweet top over the woodsy base bears a passing resemblance to the heart of Aventus (after its fruity top notes finally wear off), but once Explorer's sweet top disappears the leather and patchouli take the wheel and start to steer into the heart of Terre d'Hermes territory (minus its citrus opening).\n\nI have a coworker who wears this stuff as his signature scent so I'm pretty familiar with what it smells like from 2 cubicles over. He spent about 2 months alternating between Explorer, Td'H, and a couple Td'H flankers, trying to settle on his favorite one. From my perspective (as in, walking past his cubicle / riding in the elevator with him) I literally couldn't tell which one he was wearing from day to day without getting the chance to smell the opening (which was usually gone by the time he arrived at the office). As far as your coworkers are concerned, smelling only the heart and drydown from a distance, you'll smell like you're wearing Terre d'Hermes - not Aventus, as dozens of knee-jerk \"I just put this on 10 minutes ago for the first time and this is a 100% Aventus dupe\" Fragrantica reviews would suggest.\n\nIt's going to be interesting to compare and contrast these four woody fragrances at the end of the week.",

Ruby Red is just like the other creepers, except grapefruit, which is one of my favorite summer time scents. And it seemed like the perfect set to use with the BoK, which I recently purchased from /u/[UbaldJr](https://www.reddit.com/user/UbaldJr). It's awesome. I have to admit, the DG batches do get a bit confusing. I have a B2 that is more scritchy than this B3, despite the reputations of the two batches. And then a B2 that is way softer. Anyway, this is an exceptional brush, with an exceptional knot. One of the best balances between backbone and flow through of all my DG brushes. This was also my first time using a level 2 plate by CG. When I first bought the razor, I bought a lvl3 DC bottom plate, which I also love. But I'm glad I grabbed the Lvl2, as it is nice to be able to use the stinger with a more medium aggressive plate. The lvl3 is great, but it's very aggressive. I'm really looking to a few days off starting around 1pm today. Happy almost Fourth everyone!",

There's more going on to add some interest which I think a lot of lime soaps struggle with.\n\nThis Wolf Whiskers Brush looks badass but the knot is just too big and it's density gobbles up all my lather.

She was also kind enough to throw a toe tag in with my order after I commented on her [IG post](https://www.instagram.com/p/BzI4j6pneR3/?igshid=5uwbqew7bd3w). I'm a big dummy and didn't pick up the after shave, thinking that I already have a lot of their splashes. I definitely NEED to grab this one when it restocks.\n\nThis release is extra special because the artwork was done by our very own Lather Games champion, u/Not_A_Robot_101. He did a great job and the stuff looks fantastic.\n\nI'd also like to again thank the Lather Games organizers and sponsors. It was such a fun experience and all your hard work is greatly appreciated. I can't imagine pouring through a couple thousand shaves and organizing all that data. Great work. And congratulations again to the winners. You three were clearly deserved of the honor.",

Well they are finally here and they are awesome, the excelsior and deltus bases are top notch, and as for the scent itself, I'd be hard pressed to fins a more \"Floridian\" scent. It opens very green but then the blood orange and passion fruit began to enter the fold and it finishes with a light citrus tint to the florals. Just a super refreshing scent and perfect for a hot humid Florida day.\n\nHave a great one everybody!",

The scent notes for Orbit include Bergamot, Eucalyptus, Atlas Cedarwood, Rose, Sandalwood, Vetiver and Frozen Space. It's a very clean and fresh scent which opens up once lathered.\n\nI really love Noble Otter's soap base, it's always a pleasure to use. When dialed in, the lather is slick, dense and provides a superb post shave. The cooling effect of Orbit kicked in within 30 seconds of face lathering and kept a constant cooling effect throughout the shave. If the cooling effect on Terror is a 10, I would say Orbit is at a 5 or 6 for me. The cooling effect was constant but not overly cold that I couldn't take my time building the lather on my face.\n\nOne of the things that surprised me the most about Orbit, other than the synthetic cooling agent of course, was the updated aftershave formula. It absorbed quickly and left my face feeling even better. You can instantly feel the benefits from the new formula which has instantly become one of my favorites. I can't wait for Cody to roll it out to the rest of the lineup.\n\nI decided to stick with B&M Reserve Waves EdT. I know many are eagerly waiting for Cody to release matching EdT's. I really doubt an Orbit EdT would contain synthetic menthol but I really like this scent and would purchase one if available.",

Does it remind me of British Army officers? Well, maybe. Haven't smelled any recently, but the old world though charming combo of plum notes with clove seem a tad whimsical for a military academy. The tobacco, woods, and benzoin are solid grounding thought, and seem more \"gentlemanly\".\n\n**Razor:** The Windsor is a favorite, offering great ergonomics and an efficient shave in a very non-chattery head. The copper was probably a mistake, as the patina, such as it is, looks a bit dingy over time. The Timeless Bronze and Karve and CG brass razors in comparison are aging in a bit more dignified way, but all three of the patina metals here are changing verrrrry slowly. Infrequent use (once a month for each) and the very soft water I shave with are probably to blame.\n\n**Blade:** Thought this was my first use of the blade, but the five pack was already open and missing a blade, so I guess I used this before. It must not have made much of an impression on me!\n\nAnyway, the PS was fine, sharp, comfy, no irritation. In short, like a Poli, but can it last ten shaves like a Poli can? Stay tuned.\n\n**Frag:** Continuing my CL theme - incense and vetiver, well done, and excellent strength and projection. Probably not the best of summer scents, but still works.",

I like it, and it's one of the GD scents that didn't linger too much and goes with everything. A keeper as long as I can dial it in with a different brush.\n\nFor some reason this Lather didn't become as voluminous as I'd expected. The base worked great. I had a similar issue the last time I used this brush (with a soap I use a lot). Might need a cleaning!\n\nu/iamsms lent me this **Rex**, it's a really nice feel in the hand and the head geometry is intuitive. I used it on a lower setting, 3, which I might need to kick up a bit on my next go.\n\n**Admiral Hype** - to my nose a very nice smoky cedar with a bit of an aquatic type feel to it. It's very warm and although not one of the notes listed I swear I get a cedar scent, almost like a clean and sweet burning cedar.\n\nAnother one...gonna need to think hard because I might have to purchase the whole set. 😳",

Sort of reminded me of Reserve in that sense, which isn't really a negative, but it is a bit like using Elmer's glue. I do understand that the base has been updated with Shire, but I can't speak to the changes. However, I'm sure it's even better. Very good slickness and cushion with this version - not as thick and fatty feeling as GD. Post shave on all three of these duck soaps has been excellent, which isn't a big surprise. I'd say Bufflehead has been the easiest to lather up and load - very ezpz.",

Unclaimed and untouched for years, I made it mine. A few helpful members of the community made the educated guess that it was a Weishi or Dollar Tree special. I slapped a new Astra blade in this morning and went to town. I actually had a great shave! There was some tugging on the first pass, but it shaved efficiently. Second WTG pass didn't pick up any more hairs, so the razor, who shall remain unnamed, did a killer job. No burn noticed with the aftershave, so either my technique is improving, or the razor was mild enough not to injure.\n\nThis was my second shave with East Egg. No change in the amount of love for this set. I picked up a lot more Ylang Ylang notes this go around, which is a win for me. Thanks for taking the time. to read this. I'm going to spend the rest of my day periodically huffing myself.",

I also only had a Tweezerman brush back then, and combined with very little knowledge of how to lather a soap, it wasn't that satisfying a shave even though I really loved the scent. I got this tub when we feared B&M would not be able to make Bay-Rum for a while. A lot of water having flown under the bridge since then, I was really able to dial in the lather and enjoy it today!",

Unfortunately it seems to be sold out on Italian Barber but if someone has a 0.68-P plate they're willing to part with, please let me know, I will gladly pay you for it. :)\n\nParker Variant performed as expected, and the Elvado after shave leaves my skin smooth and hydrated as ever.\n\nHappy Wednesday, all!",

Starting with a drier brush definitely helped and this brush in general needs to break in more. Razor + blade felt amazing. Compared to the standard closed comb, the DOC was miles better. Smooth, less blade feel, but still efficient. Mild and creamy post shave to wrap it all up.\n\nSo Zenith B10 is a working progress but it finally worked well today. Hoping to continue using it for better results. Also, I got myself a tub of Maca Root and Bodyshop synthetic brush. I'll be trying those out in the near future... like tomorrow.

The NEW de Luxe was comfy, but not a close cutter.\n\nBut the big news with this shave was the first use of my Maggard Razors SHD knot. I liked it a lot.\n\nAnd the C2 paired well with the Baker St, BTW.\n\nAlso of note, is that in the video I thought this was the 153rd use of the Nacet. I was wrong. I had forgotten to put a use dot on the wrapper yesterday or the day before. So it was actually use 154 this time.\n\n#### ❧ Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Gillette - NEW de Luxe 17mm ::: Gillette - Nacet ‹154 uses›)*\n\nOkay Shave. This razor worked the Nacet rather comfortably, which was a joy to see. However, the end result was that my trouble spot was not cut down very well. A touch-up pass was required, and was still only 75% successful. So this one was not as good at working the Nacet as others. No irritation.\n\n#### ❧ Soap Notes\n*^(Stirling - Baker Street)*\n\nThem: Juniper, Bergamot, Jasmine, Patchouli\n\nScent: a zesty, refreshing scent ... there's no surprise at how well so many like it. I think it's the Juniper, but that is balanced by the Bergamot. Didn't notice much Jasmine (glad), so I'm sure it and the Patchouli (also quiet) were supportive players.\n\nIt packs a tart punch when smelled from the tub (which I really do not like), but smooths out comfortably when in lather form... where I enjoyed it very much and finally realized its appeal. It did mute itself quite a bit, but was still available when you looked for it.\n\nScent Strength: 4/10, lightly present during shaving.\n\nLather: Very good creamy, slick lather today. Just the viscosity I like. Excellent performance.\n\nI love how this lather gets so elastic when hydrated the way I like it. Takes a lot of water, but still gives creamy feel to face.\n\n* 30 second load with a lightly-wet, big, dense badger brush\n* 4.5 tsp water to build the lather\n* = 6 passes of lather\n\nBowl - I used the XL version of this bowl:\nhttps://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3392930\n\n#### ❧ Brush Notes\n*^(Maggard Razors - SHD 26 mm - Super High Density‹27 uses›)*\n\nMy first time with this Maggard SHD knot. I mounted it about as high as I could, because these 2-bands, like the Elite Manchurian and Stirling Finest, that have some backbone, often have a bit too much for me. Put in 3 plastic washers and it looks nice and has a wide bloom.\n\nThe handle is from Craving Shaving and I LOVE the ergonomics for my whopper mitts.\n\nI don't know if this knot tends to hook and gel, but I kinda hope not. As of now, it hasn't yet. It was fairly easy to splay enough to scrub my face nicely, without shoving it around too much. That being my biggest concern with these types of brushes, I'm very pleased. It also did well in the painting type of motion, but most brushes do.\n\nThe tips were softer than the Elite Manch, but not as soft as a Decl Grm B5, or many of my soft silvertips. This can obviously change, if this thing gels up.\n\nI think this knot is very flexible, and would offer substantial backbone if you wanted to mount it a bit deeper into the well. As for me, I like it where it is.\n\nA very good first impression. And I'll definitely enjoy using it in my next shave.\n\n----\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Just a little tugging\n*Neck*: Just a little tugging\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Very Close Shave\n*Neck*: Many hairs show whisker tips with a little length to them\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm) *and also in the sub's sidebar.*\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

It's a wonderfully layered scent profile with the note's of sweet powder and sandalwood really driving it for me. I enjoyed the aftershave splash as well, it reminded me of an aged dark liquor when applied but as the alcohol dried off I was left with that really nice powder note and a surprising amount of staying power. Really added to the overall scent experience and left my face feeling better than it ever has. Didn't even reach for the Nivea balm. Can't wait to try some Stirling products later this week/next. Thanks for reading and may you be blessed with a thousand years of irritation free shaves.",

Twa Burds is an artisan soap maker based in Glasgow. They make vegan soaps in a variety of scents. Their description of Burds of Paradise:\n\n>Burds of Paradise is our own signature blend with tropical and citrus fragrances resting on a musky base of sandalwood, amber, musk and vanilla.\n\nIt's a sweet, fruity scent with a good strength and longevity. It's a harder soap than I've been using recently, so it took a while longer to lather. It built a great, slick lather which was a pleasure to work with. I'm looking forward to coming back to this one. On reflection I think it'd go pretty nicely with YRP next time.\n\nWizamets seem to perform broadly similar to Polsilvers to me (which is to say very well). The main difference seems to be the rate at which they corrode. They start out looking identical, but the Wizamets have shown rust stains after 3-4 shaves, whereas I've never seen a Polsilver corrode in that way.\n\nHave a great Thursday all!",

I decided to do the most patriotic shave I could, starting with a song about the time Canada kicked our asses, the best soap i could think of to go with this tune was groom, product of Montreal! A soap I don't use nearly enough. Smells great, sort of piney scent, lathers well (basically a mdc clone.) I started loading with my dogclaration (sadly not a product of Canada.)\n\nI start lathering my face, by the time I get done, the song ends and I start the next song, barretts privateers, I start dragging the Karve (CANADAAAA.) across my face as I hear the chorus \"GOD DAMN THEM ALL! I was told we'd cruise the seas for American gold! Fire no guns, shed no tears! Now I'm a broken man on a Halifax pier! The last of barrett's privateers! \"\n\nthe song plays throughout the shave and I get to post, I decide to finish up with some PDP balm and the Canadian national anthem.",

I've got to try to cook everything that we're eating today outside either on the grill or in the smoker because my ac unit went out and the new one can't be installed until Saturday, so no unnecessary heating up the house.

Independence!\n\nI think it's hilarious when I hear Brits call us the \"colonies\" even these days. But here's to a bunch of folks who wanted a land of their own, and to be able to have a government where they had adequate representation.\n\nI'm pretty sure Hook or Plunder would have been more fitting scents for today, but alas, I'm too wiped out to think that far ahead. Just grabbed something fun and went off to shave.\n\nMy first time with Lu'au and it was very nice. And I continue to enjoy the Maggard SHD.\n\n#### ❧ Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Gillette - Fat Boy Setting 7 ::: Gillette - Nacet ‹155 uses›)*\n\nI was surprised at how well the Fat Boy worked with the Nacet. I thought I remember him being rough with it once it aged. But I rode the cap a little more than usual, which seemed to be the best stroke, and it gave me a very nice shave. I was constantly surprised at how well it was feeling. And then I got to the inspection after the 3rd pass, and the cut was great. Really happy with it.\n\nOf course, I had to use an aggression setting (7) that I don't normally use with \"normal\" age blades, but it felt smooth and not harsh at all.\n\n#### ❧ Soap Notes\n*^(Mickey Lee Soapworks - Lu'au)*\n\nThem: \"Fruity, floral, tropical\" ... Passion Fruit, Coconut, Ginger, Sandalwood, Rose, Lime, Patchouli\n\nScent: I thought it was pineapple, but I guess it was really the Passion Fruit I was smelling. I'll have to be more analytical next time. It was just a fun, tropical scent that I could easily see being used to take the shaver to other places.\n\nScent Strength: x/10, X present during shaving.\n\nLather: Very nice lather, slick and creamy at once. Creamy rinses. But not all that much secondary slickness, so make sure you relather as necessary.\n\n* 30 second load with big lightly-wet dense badger brush\n* 2.5 tsp water\n* = 5 passes of lather.\n\nBowl - I used the XL version of this bowl:\nhttps://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3392930\n\n#### ❧ Brush Notes\n*^(Maggard Razors - SHD 26 mm - Super High Density‹2 uses›)*\n\nBrush did very well again. Tips got a little softer. Splays easily enough to give a comfortable scrubbing motion. Wonderful face feel.\n\n----\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm) *and also in the sub's sidebar.*\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

I could already smell the menthol while loading the soap.\n\nI began getting the cooling effect within a minute of face lathering and it continued to increase in strength the longer I spent lathering. Similar to Arctique, Cryogen had me in tears and blowing my nose frequently. I guess you don't need to add too much water since you can easily work in your tears while building the lather. I had no issues getting a slick and protective lather.\n\nI don't have a matching sample of the aftershave so I ended up using Stirling's unscented witch hazel & aloe with menthol. It normally provides a bit of cooling with non mentholated soaps but it ended up feeling rather normal after using Cryogen.",

I know a lot of people describe The Kraken or perhaps Ghost Town Barber as the \"cleanest\" barbershops around, but I think this one has it beat. Being a dead soap company (RIP in peace) there's no official scent notes to be found any more, but I would guess it's a fairly basic basil / bergamot / oakmoss / patchouli barbershop accord; in other words, it's the same barbershop core from Kraken and GTB without the added aquatics or cowboy notes.\n\nPerformance was not fantastic in my hard water. I could not whip the bubbles out of this lather and it was fairly airy. Difficult to spread into an even layer on the face. Didn't hold together well and started collapsing pretty quickly (by today's artisan standards) during the shave. Pretty thin and slick, at least, and I did get a good shave in the end, but I didn't much enjoy it. The best [SpongeScore](https://old.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/c8lhoc/wednesday_sotd_thread_jul_03_2019/esnz1hp/) I can give it is a 4/10: not recommended unless you're looking for a history lesson.\n\nMy fragrance today is ApH Night Time. Last time I wore it I also stank up the house by turning on a dusty furnace and didn't get a clear picture of the first couple hours, so today will be a fresh first impression for the opening again. I'll update my post later once I've had some more time to reflect on it. All I really remember is that it reminded me of YSL La Nuit de l'Homme with nutmeg and black pepper instead of cardamom and caraway and a bit less lavender.",

This was my first go with a gamechanger, which is kindly on loan to me. My first impressions are that I prefer my Karve with the A plate. The Karve is equally as efficient, with my less blade feel and much more comfort. This wasn't the most comfortable shave in terms of the razor.\n\nYesterday was a big day for me. I hit my first ever ring of death. Its just a baby RoD, but its the home stretch from here. I will feel better about myself once I finally kill off my first soap.\n\nHerod is a great frag, and this came in yesterday too from a great deal from a member of this community. One of my all time favs.\n\nHappy 4th everyone and be safe!",

My kit from WCS arrived a few days ago and waited until today to try it out. It wasn't the best or smoothest shave, but I didn't cut my self and it was fun. I did a 2 pass WTG and XTG. I found that holding the razor was a bit awkward and my lather was too stiff. These are things that will come with practice. The razor has quite the heft which I really enjoyed. The weight made it easy to let gravity do the work and not apply pressure.\nI am excited to finally get started and can see myself doing this for the rest of my life. Happy 4th of July everyone!",

The cooling agent set in by the end of my first pass and was cool enough to be refreshing without being obnoxious. Fragrance is sharp of the tub but lightens up when lathered. It like some citrus and water notes that can be a reminder of a day at the pool.\n\nChasing sunsets is a nice pairing with the soap with a strong citrus forward and a musky, woody base. It's really very nice. Hope everyone has a great day doing your thing.",

Super easy to use and slick. Decent residual slickness and post shave, the splash burns but also seems to have some nice moisturizing properties\n\nRex - it's pretty aggressive on 4/5, might need to dial it in a bit more to figure out what works for me.\n\nHappy 4th of July !",

The military issue was even claimed to have saved the life of a soldier carrying his shave kit in his breast pocket, interesting stuff. This is a later piece from the mid 20s to early 30s since it's brass and sans-serial number but an awesome made in the USA razor nonetheless. It was a great shave and although it's relative aggression compared to the Tech and the Fatboy on 5 took an adjustment along with it being my first go with an open comb, I have to say I'm extremely pleased with my pre-firework smooth. Barrbarr helped get me into the headspace of a classic American barbershop and a comb through my pomade set me in the right mindset for a wonderful night celebrating the US of A with the family. Happy shaving and have a wonderful 4th everyone!",

Being outside for the 4 hours of peak sun without sunscreen on my legs would do that. Legs got the worst of it, no surprise there, followed by the back (looks like angel wings), shoulders, collarbone, top of my hands, even my face looks a bit puffy. Three times last night I made some lather for my legs with a blend of Stirling lemon chill, B&M Terror, and Cryogen. Didn't seem to have a lasting effect, unfortunately. They were quite stiff getting out of bed this morning. I needed the extra kick of coolness so I reached for Orbit. The shave was a bit harsh because of 2 days growth on an old blade, but I powered through. Luckily not too much of my face got red, just around my sideburns (pun intended) and just puffy eyes, strangely enough. My wife made a comment that it looks like she punched me in the face a few times. I ended up using the aftershave splash on nearly every spot that got burnt, at the very least I smell nice.\n\nLife is short, shave with good gear.",

Lemon in warmer weather is just perfect, and the creamy floral supporting notes round it out nicely.\n\nI'll probably be the only person at work today in my office. Lucky me.",

I was so impressed that I completely stole the idea and the name he came up with to produce [Club Mitch](https://i.imgur.com/1KXP3av.mp4).\n\nI let the Pinaud sit in the soap shavings for a few days until it was [completely absorbed](https://i.imgur.com/a30FEZY.jpg). Then I pressed it down [into a puck shape](https://i.imgur.com/1yWedy7.jpg) and let it sit a couple days more. It hardened up pretty well and the after shave scent is crazy strong.\n\nI lathered some up just to see what it would would do and it works just fine! Mitchell's can be a pain in the ass sometimes but the lather looked so good I decided to bust out my $6 Shavette and give her a go. Shaves just as good as regular Mitchell's but smells Like Club Man. It's not something I would keep doing but if someone wanted to get creative on a budget and make some aftershave smelling soaps, it's a good little project. Actually, now that I think about it, I kind of want to mix a little Cryogen in with it. Hmmmm. Next time. Back to proper soaps tomorrow.",

I get zero hints of any barbershop anything out of it. It smells like the freshest clean laundry ever in every good way possible. I've heard about how clean smelling it is, but hearing does no justice. And the soap was just the tip of the iceberg. The balm is where the scent really opened up. Speaking of which, I've gotta figure out a way to fix the balm. I'm assuming the terrible southern heat caused it to separate and shaking the shit out of it only helps temporarily before it separated again. I figure I'll try microwaving, stirring like a mofo, and then refrigerating it like u/hawns instructed me to do with a container of his salve way back when and it worked like a charm. Speaking of CL, I finished off today with my freshest scent which is Eau De Treget. Just a lovely sweet chypre that rounded off everything well today.",

It felt tuggy and scratchy and I had all kinds of burn afterwards and I noticed that while I was rinsing between the first and second pass, there was still a lot of hair left over, which I think caused me to use more pressure on the second pass. It's not the razor cuz I use it almost everyday and it's not the brush cuz this is now the softest brush I own. I'm tempted to blame the lather since it was first time with MER Shaving but I felt no irritation or burning while I was face lathering. And so the blade must go.\n\nA quick note on this soap though; it's great. The scent is the star of the show. The grapefruit is crisp, clean, and refreshing and the duck fat base felt great on my face. I wish they had a matching splash but I went with Reserve Spice today because I had a sample that's been sitting around since my Diamond order.\n\nStill working on Unconditional Surrender. It's excellent and I've gotten pretty familiar with it over the past few days. I can't decide which Chatty Lux sample to use next. Might put up a strawpoll for it.\n\nHappy Friday!",

Piacenza is a Acqua di Parma dupe that really smells good. It's not too strong and doesn't last but it's pleasant to shave with.\n\nHaven't used Stirling in a while. I appreciate how easily this soap lathers up - definitely a great soap for getting started in the hobby. Performance is also very good and I was pretty happy to be shaving with Stirling again.\n\nThe tips on the B7 are starting to soften up really well. There's some gel but not too much but I don't feel I'm missing anything. It's a fantastic brush and it's still getting better.\n\nHave a great weekend all!",

Instead I dug around in the \"I don't use these products very often\" drawer and pulled out my tub of Proraso White to see how it compares to the artisan offerings of ancient times.\n\nI find Proraso's slickness terrible if I bowl lather and paint it onto my face, but it's actually pretty good if I spend most of my lathering energy right on the face so the soap has more time to, I dunno, soak into my skin or something. Doing that seems to make a big difference with most soaps and Proraso is no exception. Lather like a beginner, get beginner results. Lather like a pro and treat the soap with some respect, get the best performance the soap has to offer. It also helps to load it like you hate it, which should be easy for most folks 'round these parts...\n\nAnyhoo, nice smooth shave. There's some menthol in it that builds a little with each pass of the shave: pleasantly breezy on the first past, chilly on the second, and cold on the third. Post-shave begs for a moisturizer in the winter and hints at needing one in the summer, so it certainly falls behind the pack in that regard. Blame my [dry skin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reptilian_humanoid) I guess.\n\nAs far as fragrance goes, Proraso White contains extremely minute quantities of thyme, oat, and tea leaf extracts, as well as much higher quantities of Parfum and some leafy / floral / citrus aromachemicals. I honestly can't pin down what the overall effect is. Most people I've shown this to disliked the scent the first time they smelled it, myself included, but it's tolerable now. It's the least unappealing of the three Proraso varieties to my nose. (Not a huge eucalyptus or sandalwood fan.)\n\nAll things considered, **I give Proraso White a [SpongeScore](https://old.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/c8lhoc/wednesday_sotd_thread_jul_03_2019/esnz1hp/) of 5/10.** Can I get a good shave out of it? Absolutely, as long as I play by its rules. Do I enjoy using it? Not much. If I lived in Europe and had their \"so cheap it's almost free\" Proraso prices I'd have a higher opinion of this stuff, but it's too expensive in my region of Canada to be worth using because I can get Cella cheaper.\n\nI wore ApH Night Time yesterday. Really tart smoky-spicy rhubarb and bitter-orange opening, then a transition into a spicy-woody lavender heart and eventually a cedar-vetiver drydown. Once again it reminded me of La Nuit de l'Homme, so that's what I'm wearing today: cardamom, bergamot, and lavender for hours and hours until it mellows to a caraway-cedar-vetiver drydown. Marvelous and classy but it burned the hell out of my sinuses last time I wore it so I'm being careful to spray lightly today. Maybe these two fragrances aren't blood brothers (the openings are rather different) but they're certainly close cousins as they dry down.",

An indication of its strength is that, rather than the usual shrink-wrapped minipuck, there was about a third of a minipuck in a little ziplock baggie. It didn't fit my plans for the games, but today's the day.\n\nOff the puck, it smells like Wrigley's Spearmint gum. Lathered, it smells even more like that, but with the medicinal background scent of a Vicks-shaming amount of menthol. I typically face lather, and I was definitely feeling the burn. When I finished my shave, my head was completely clear for probably the first time in two weeks. For a similar experience, try the new extreme cough drops Vicks is selling. They're a kick in the face, too.\n\nLather quality was Stirling standard. Good shave.\n\nFinished with the Frozen Tundra splash to keep the face burn going. The pairing worked well.",

The scent notes for Cannonball are Pineapple, Orange, Water, Ozone and Chlorine which are meant to smell like a tropical day at the pool.\n\nI don't have an overly sensitive nose and typically don't pickup scent notes from other soap maker's soap bases themselves however I do get a little bit of funk from this one. I chalk that up to my unfamiliarity with this artisan and will likely leave the sample open to air out a bit. I had also purchased samples of Field Day and Picture Day and get a bit of funk from those two so it's not just Cannonball.\n\nRegarding the soap itself, I'll start off by saying that the Cannonball sample is in the new Honor Roll base and I don't have any performance comparisons to the old base since I never had a chance to try it out. With that aside, I was blown away by the soap base. It loaded easily and the lather was dense, slick, offered great protection and post shave feel. It instantly jumped into the ring with some of the best soap bases that I have tried.\n\nThe cooling effect on Cannonball has the perfect balance for me. It creeps in within a minute of lathering and isn't overly intense. This is meant to give you a slight cooling effect, not a freezing one, and I really enjoyed it.\n\nCannonball's scent notes came together nicely once lathered and definitely brought back memories of a fun day at the pool with the family. Summer Break Soaps has a new fan and I intend to pick up a set or two once I have a chance to try out the other samples. I wish it hadn't taken as long to try this artisan out but I'm glad I finally have.\n\nThis wraps up my work week of trying out mentholated and cooling soaps. I never intended to rank the soaps based on soap performance or soap bases but in terms of the cooling effect itself my final rankings are as follows: Terror, Cryogen, Arctique, Orbit and Cannonball.",

It takes some getting used to. It doesn't seem like it can take as much water as it can when you are loading, but once you start face lathering with paste it becomes quite evident, even when you start off with the Marco Method^(TM). Multiple more additions of water later, the lather really turns into something great. The Deltus aftershave doesn't seem like a huge upgrade from Tonique to me, but it does make my skin feel nice in this hot weather. u/jeffm54321 was kind enough to send me his leftover samples of the BaM Fougere EdPs and today I went with Imperiale. This is a loud fougere with a strong vegetal type of smell on opening, but dries down into a more traditional accord. I think it's very nice once you get past that initial blast of funky wet grass smell.",

Canon smoke, gunpowder, with some pirate thrown in for the vigor of one's convictions. I give you: Plunder, and Hook.\n\n#### ❧ Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Gillette - Fat Boy Setting 7 ::: Gillette - Nacet ‹156 uses›)*\n\nWonderful shave with this old goat. Fatty is handling it well.\n\n#### ❧ Soap Notes\n*^(Noble Otter - Plunder)*\n\nThem: \"Slight bay rum elements an' 'eavy on the wood smoke\" and\n\"Bay, Grog, Spice, Rose, Lime, Grapefruit, Vetiver, Cannon Smoke\"\n\nScent: I think the rose sweetens up the smoke and makes it more resemble a cooking wood fire, rather than the pungent smoke from cannon fire. The rose definitely doesn't make this a floral scent, but it does in my opinion, weaken the effect of the smoke, and other masculine elements to a small degree. I wasn't really able to discern the Vetiver, but I think I was able to pick up a hint of citrus.\n\nThe rose has backed off since my first try of it. No problem now. Thoroughly enjoy the scent now.\n\nScent Strength: 4-5/10, present during shaving.\n\nLather: as wonderful as always. Luxurious rinses and feel. Good protection and excellent glide for the razor.\n\n* 30 second load with lightly-wet, dense, big badger brush\n* 7 tsp water to build the lather\n* = 6 passes of lather.\n\nDefinitely back off on the soap next time!\n\nBowl - I used the XL version of this 3D-printable bowl:\nhttps://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3392930\n\n#### ❧ Brush Notes\n*^(Maggard Razors - SHD 26 mm - Super High Density‹3 uses›)*\n\nContinuing to like this brush a lot. No gel yet!\n\n----\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Few hairs are showing some tip length (with most being cut flush)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm) *and also in the sub's sidebar.*\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

This is the day foretold in the prophecies of our dear leader - [J.R. \"Bob\" Dobbs](http://www.subgenius.com/bigfist/pics2/logoart/TheBOB.jpeg) - when the aliens from Planet X would arrive to whisk the SubGenii away in their intergalactic pleasure craft while delivering a swift and sure end to the pinks and normies of the world. Hallelujah! And even though it has been 21 years since the first X-Day in 1998, we have not given up hope. For \"Bob\" has told us that the Church of the SubGenius will bring us [eternal salvation or triple your money back!](https://youtu.be/Qt9MP70ODNw) Praise \"Bob\"! And let us not forget the sacred slogans of the Church:\n\n* \"Fuck 'Em If They Can't Take A Joke\"\n* \"Too Much Is Always Better Than Not Enough\"\n* \"Pull The Wool Over Your Own Eyes\"\n* \"Give Me Slack, Or Give Me Food, Or Kill Me\"\n* \"If You Act Like A Dumbshit, They'll Treat You As An Equal\"\n\nSince u/CosmoBarber threw down the Club Mitch gauntlet today, I figured I had to break out the Blue Willy. As folks have pointed out, I am not the inventor of the Blue Willy, just the person who posted about it during this year's Lather Games. The Blue Willy, as I understand it, was an attempt by the best Boomer scientists of the B&B forum to improve the lather of Williams Mug Soap. Similar to popular soupmakers, they understood that the addition of glycerin to soap could result in a better lather. It just so happens that Aqua Velva (and many other aftershaves) contains glycerin. These brave pioneers began by putting a few drops of aftershave directly on their Williams puck before lathering and progressed to grinding up the entire puck and soaking it in Ice Blue goodness, which is more or less what I did.\n\nDid the Blue Willy lather better than a standard puck of Williams Mug Soap? Yes. Did it smell better? You bet your ass it did. Does it compare favorably to popular artisan soaps? No way in hell. But it was fun to create and amusing to use. Perhaps we will see it, or something similar, during next year's Lather Games. In fact, I have just been struck with an idea that I will not speak aloud because it could be a real winner in next year's games. :)",

I had a nice but not that remarkable shave. Subbing a brand new GP blade today made a world of difference--I have not experienced a more efficient first pass since the few times I played around with a slant razor. By the 3rd pass I was BBS with zero nicks or irritation. This soap has a great lingering scent and phenomenal post-shave feel. I didn't buy the splash to go with it, so I paired with CL DdT, and the combination worked well. I still pick up some of the soap scent a few hours after the shave--pretty unusual scent longevity for a soap, in my experience. TL:DR - Don't waste any shaves on mediocre blades.",

My new work schedule leaves me little time to be on my phone. So if y'all didn't know. I finally quit my shitty part time job, and I got a full time job in another city!\n\n\nI showed up early and have some extra time to kill. The SoCal Shave Meetup went very well. If you're reading this, and you were there. I hope that you had a great time, and I look forward to doing it again real soon!\n\n\nBehold the Whatsis is a very unique, and sweet scent. It's citrus forward, it's sweet, it's clean. Can't compare it to anything. But I enjoy it a lot.\n\n\nThe Carbon Cx Razor has been working out for me really well. I love the feel of it, and the angle is very easy to find. It just glides across the skin. It looks very comparable to the 1940s Pre-War Tech, but it's much more efficient. Ive been enjoying a lot, and it's a great addition to my collection.",

After some research, I found that the aluminium RR Baby Smooth meets my criteria: light, consistent shave. The Knack weighs in at 44g, whereas the Baby Smooth weighs 37g. After reading a bunch of reviews, I decided to pull the trigger when the razor went on sale.\n\nThe Baby Smooth came in in the mail yesterday, so I got to try it out today. I paired it with a Med Prep blade I used once and went to town with my usual travel equipment. Arko never fails to give me a good lather, no matter the water conditions, and is easy to lather with the help of my Maggard synth brush directly on skin or with a bowl. I could feel a bit of bite with the Baby Smooth and Med Prep blade at times and managed to re-open a wound on my ankle, but aside from that, it gave me a DFS with little effort. I remember reading about some concerns on it being a light aluminium razor, but it wasn't much of an issue for me- in fact, a major point influencing my purchasing decision.\n\nNeedless to say, this is going to be my travel razor from now on. I'm excited for my next trip in a couple weeks to use it again!\n\nHappy Friday, everyone!",

The razor + blade combo felt good for the first two passes but the ATG portion was rough. I felt irritation on my neck and chin, with bits of weepers. It's probably the old blade with more aggressive DOC setup. Chilling alcohol-based aftershave + Cooling balm felt nice on the skin.\n\nATG is definitely better with new blades. I'm thinking twice before ATG shaving with older blades. I still have to try out the Body Shop products so that'll be in the future shaves. Maybe in couple of days. I'm also interesting in picking up a Schick Krona but it's hard to get one for a good deal. Still searching through the bay and bazaars...",

I purchased a Vikings Blade Vulcan on impulse a few weeks ago. At first it was a little rough. I was applying way to much pressure and my face looked and felt like i scraped it with sandpaper. However, after about two weeks, I feel that i have finally got my technique down. Tonight I successfully completed my first WTG, XTG, & ATG shave. My wife gave me compliments. No cuts or knicks and my face is not on fire. I am finding that this type of shaving is very relaxing and enjoyable.",

I picked up the #58 for a not-terrible price on ebay and it is in pretty decent condition. I love the design of the knurling and I appreciate the weightiness of it. It shaves really nicely. I no longer have my black handle super speed, but my impression is the #58 has a little more blade exposure and is more efficient. Very smooth.\n\nSense of smell is a weird thing. My wife thinks LTV smells earthy, but to me it's almost a sweet, aniseed-y scent. Just like you'd expect from CB, the base is awesome and the scent strength is really good. I got LTV from a PIF from semi-pro soapmaker u/CosmoBarber. Thanks again Cosmo!\n\nI might have got a bit trigger happy with Taum Sauk today, but it's been hot here recent, and holy moly is the menthol in Taum Sauk welcome.\n\nI keeping with the green theme I went with Guerlain Vetiver. It feels like a dirtier, rowdier scent than Grey Vetiver, but still brings tons of that good good vetiver that I crave. Good times.\n\nHave a great weekend all!",

      "body": "**2019-07-06 SOTD: Magical Perfumery Tour - Misc Scents 1/3**\n\n**Razor:** Fatip Piccolo SE (Gentile)\n\n**Blade:** Astra Superior Stainless (shave #7)\n\n**Brush:** ShaveHQ 24mm tuxedo Synthetic\n\n**Lather:** Stirling Haverford (borrowed from wet-shavin' coworker)\n\n**Post:** Nivea balm\n\n**Fragrance:** [Tobacco Vanille dupe by Hayward Enterprises](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Tom-Ford/Tobacco-Vanille-1825.html) (gift)\n\n**Thoughts:**\n\nI have a few scents that I wasn't sure how to tie in with the rest in my collection so they're up next. Haverford is wonderful. It's not a dirty tobacco smell, it's fruity and sweet. It's the sort of tobacco that has hints of cherry and raisin. It's paired up with lots of vanilla and dried fruits and hints of cocoa, spices, and woods. So good. So desserty. Reminds me a little of '80s fruit snacks, except classy. I'm pairing it with a roller-ball fragrance oil dupe of Tobacco Vanille that a friend sent me from Georgia. He couldn't stop raving about how good it was. I'm curious to see how it smells through the day.\n\n*****\n\n**Woody Scents Recap**\n\nI compared four woody fragrances this week (2 new and 2 old favorites). They sort of broke down into two subsets.\n\n**Group 1: They Technically Aren't All Fruity Chypres But They All Kinda Smell A Bit Like A Famous One**\n\n[Explorer](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Montblanc/Explorer-52002.html) and Azzaro Pour Homme [Silver Black](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Azzaro/Silver-Black-3089.html) / [Onyx](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Azzaro/Onyx-3087.html) (same fragrance with 2 different names for 2 different markets, each advertised with only a subset of the complete list of scent notes) both ended up reminding me of the well-known [Aventus](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Creed/Aventus-9828.html) [family](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Armaf/Club-de-Nuit-Intense-Man-34696.html) of [scents](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Al-Haramain-Perfumes/L-Aventure-40405.html). (It's funny to call it the Aventus family when the Azzaro hit the market first, but Aventus is much better known as a reference point.) When comparing all five:\n\n* They all open with Bergamot and most have some secondary fruits; these may or may not include apple, black currant, pineapple, lemon, lime, and/or orange. The various strength and longevity of these notes are probably the biggest distinguishing feature between these five fragrances, as far as the wearer is concerned.\n\n* They all have a heart of sweet florals (mostly rosy notes and jasmine) and smokey woods (which range from birch to juniper to synthetic woods).\n\n* They all have patchouli, some variation on Ambrox, and some kind of Vanilla-like notes in their base. Almost all include musk. The drydown is rather similar between all five perfumes.\n\nThey vary in a few ways. Aventus probably has the most pineapple in its top (though [if you buy a bottle of Pineapple](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Demeter-Fragrance/Pineapple-7784.html) it's pretty easy to change that). CdNIM has its much bemoaned mega-lemon opening that overshadows the other fruits. l'Aventure has no pineapple, but its simpler fruity opening outlasts the rest thanks to the fixative power of its elemi note (I think). Explorer gets over its straight forward bergamot start remarkably quick and adds a strong vetiver note that projects several feet outside of your central bubble of sweetness; a distant observer will just smell Terre d'Hermes-style woody vetiver until they get into your personal space. The Azzaro flanker has a big spicy-bitter aromatic opening and a sweet fern accord buried in its heart [to associate it with its heritage](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Azzaro/Azzaro-pour-Homme-829.html) and its woody notes are more evergreen than hardwood.\n\nThe Azzaro flanker is my personal favorite of the bunch (and also the cheapest because it's discontinued), which leaves me in a dilly of a pickle. I have a 99% full bottle of l'Aventure and a gift certificate for a 100 ml bottle of Explorer in my closet but I'm worried I'll rarely wear them. That's a lot of dollars tied up in perfume that might not get used. Not sure if I should try to sell them or just give them away as gifts to my father and step-brother at Christmas this year. Hmmm. Anybody in Canada want one of those?\n\n**Group 2: Woody Spicy Dessert**\n\nI impulse-bought a bottle of [Azzaro Pour Homme Night Time](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Azzaro/Azzaro-Pour-Homme-Night-Time-13965.html) about a month ago without a chance to sample it first... it was $20 CAD and I had heard it has rhubarb in it and I have a Mennonite grandmother so *I basically have rhubarb and perogies flowing through my veins.* On first wearing my nose perked up and said, \"I know this scent.\" It took a few hours to realize that it smells a lot like [Yves Saint Laurent's La Nuit de l'Homme](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Yves-Saint-Laurent/La-Nuit-de-l-Homme-5521.html). Imagine that. \"Azzaro for Men: Night Time\" smells like \"YSL: The Night of the Man.\"\n\n* LNdlH has bergamot (spicy, bitter-sweet citrus; a crossbreed between grapefruit and Seville oranges). APHNT has bitter orange and rhubarb. They perform the same role but they definitely smell different.\n\n* LNdlH has cardamom and caraway for spice. APHNT has nutmeg and black pepper. Again, same role, different shades of grey.\n\n* Both have lavender, vetiver, and cedar. (Lavender and coumarin are missing from the Fragrantica page for APHNT.) LNdlH has more lavender. APHNT has more vetiver and cedar.\n\nThe overall effect is that they both have a similar dry-grass vetiver/cedar drydown, with APHNT's being accompanied by a rhubarb crumble and LNdlH's being accompanied by a gingerbread cookie (apparently the original inspiration for the perfume?). I like them both a lot and could honestly live with either one in my collection. That said, the Azzaro flanker is dirt cheap, I already own it, it has much better longevity, and it irritates my sinuses less. Maybe I'll buy a full tub of Sandpiper (to replace my sample tub) to go with the Azzaro and call it a day.",

But there's no way to kill the tub without expeditious use of the damn stuff. I do wish I knew a fragrance I could add on top that would work well with it. I've tried a few and the only thing that could really sit on top of it was Roam, but it smothered out the scent instead of playing nice with it.

Did a pretty crummy shave yesterday and it was apparent by half-day, there were whiskers at the length of two days that somehow didn't get cut. Decided to pull out a straight (it's been too long) and tested my hand. Had one decent cut on my neck because as I pulled the skin tight I and was coming up to line up the stroke, I made contact about half an inch sooner than I expected. Nothing some alum couldn't fix. ATG went pretty well, it leaves a nicer face-feel than the 3-month old DE blade.\n\nOff to do some shopping for the gift exchange!\n\nLife is short, shave with good gear.",

I am a fan of the previous Vegan base, but this new one kicks it up a notch. It's thirsty, so make sure you add more water, but once properly hydrated it's one of the better bases out there. The scent is great, though I wish it was a little stronger. The 30mm SHD continues to impress me, this has fast become one of my favorite brushes. Don't hesitate to pick up an SHD if you're on fence.",

When I first started using straights a few years ago I would use a safety razor at least once a week. But I quit using safety razors altogether after a point. I did use one on a road trip about 14 months ago, but regular use of them has been two years or more in the past.\n\nSo why did I break that streak? Well, /u/Cadinsor very kindly sent some generous samples of soap from brands I have never used. Included in the package was this Razorine safety razor. If you haven't seen the video of his review, [here is a link](https://youtu.be/y_aWtFotupg). The Razorine is a bit strange looking in that it is a DE head made with a shavette style format. Before I actually used it for the first time today, I made some mock passes (sans blade) in recent days to try to get a feel for it. In spite of having experience with a straight razor, the Razorine feels quite a bit different in the hand and in use. There is definitely a learning curve to find the technique. Since I use each hand with a straight razor, I was able to switch hands easier that a neophyte probably would. It was certainly better for me to switch hands that to try to shave with just my dominant hand.\n\nSo how does it shave? In spite of the awkwardness of unfamiliarity, I actually got a pretty good shave with it. Because I am accustomed to the open blade of a straight razor, the Razorine seemed to be on the mild side, but I will defer to others for that assessment. I don't have enough recent experience with safety razors to make a fair judgement with regard to that.\n\nThis is the chrome finish model and the finish is not bad actually. The fit? Well, there are some problems. The blade does not sit evenly in the razor without special attention to make it even. In addition, the top plate will rotate slightly even when tightened. It will stay in place but you have to straighten it manually. This would probably be an easy fix by just altering the design of the threaded post a bit at the factory. In spite of these issues, I managed to get even blade exposure and a straight top plate.\n\nI still need several shaves with it to get a better feel for the razor and to more fairly judge it.\n\nI am still digging on this SHD. The gelling is still increasing a tad which was a total surprise. I may have to get another of these knots.",

Scent notes are peppermint and Frankincense and has the WS-12 cooling agent. (I believe it's the 12?). The soap has a nice cooling effect that isn't uncomfortable. Once the skin is cold the fragrance kind of reminds me of a cold breeze.\n\n\nFun fact: WS is short for [Wilkinson Sword](https://www.leffingwell.com/cooler_than_menthol.htm) who funded the research to create it back in the 70's.\n\n\nAnother thing I just learned is that you can use alum on your finger tips to make them not slip when stretching your skin for a shave. There's a lot of beginner straight razor tips from the Cadre in a series done by [HandleBarber Dave](https://youtu.be/63cNUU206-0).",

Barbershop has been my #2 scent for a while just behind Leviathan. But yesterday I have decided that I can have two #1 scents. If I had to chose one scent for the rest of time, it would be impossible to chose between these two. They are both my fixtures in my world now and I cannot live without either of them.\n\nOut of all the soaps I have, here is my ranking system.\n\n1a) leviathan\n1b) Barbershop\n2a) Seville\n2b) Ghost Town Barber\n3) Duc de santal\n4) Stirling Gentleman (sample)\n5). Stirling D-503\n6) Uncle Jon Pipe Smoke\n7) Stirling Mountain Man (sample)\n\nI had Executive Man but had to sell it to buy a bottle of Seville EDT. I have veered away from cologne scented soaps. The two that I have now are enough for me.\n\nSo there you have it folks. I don't own a lot of soap... but the soap i have is my favourite soap. I am happy with my lot and there is absolutely nothing I would change at this point. Everything I have is my favourite. These are sort of my Mount Rushmore of soaps and will end up being replaced once they run out.",

Really like it now.\n\n#### ❧ Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Gillette - Fat Boy Setting 7 ::: Gillette - Nacet ‹157 uses›)*\n\nMore tuggy than usual today, probably due to crappy lather. But we put down another notch in the old Nacet belt.\n\n#### ❧ Soap Notes\n*^(Captain's Choice - Sandalwood)*\n\nScent: pretty authentic Sandalwood, IMO. Not much else, which I like.\n\nScent Strength: 3-4/10, very lightly present during shaving.\n\nStrength of the scent was another disappointment, because I really like this one.\n\nLather: Very disappointed in this base. The lather I got was full of tiny bubbles that never went away. It was thin and airy. It was adequate to shave with, but that's all. I hope this was some old base.\n\nSo I did my standard 30 sec load and the lather dissipated in the bowl fairly quickly. Wow. So I went back and loaded for 20 sec more. That brought the quantity of lather up to normal, but it was thin and airy and did not look appealing to shave with.\n\nSo just in case I missed some memo, I loaded more soap just to try to get it to go creamy. So another 30 seconds... in the soap tub goes the brush. I got more lather, but it always stayed thin and airy.\n\nSo I just shaved with it. It didn't feel very good, until most of the hair was removed with the first pass. Then there was enough slickness in the lather to treat me okay. Serviceable, but only that.\n\nCould the ridges in my lather bowl have put in too many bubbles? Doesn't seem to be a problem with any other soap. Is this a soap base that requires you to add water super slowly? To be honest, I don't know that I want to try again. Too many great soaps out there.\n\n* 80 second load, by the end of the shave, with lightly-wet big badger brush\n* 3 tsp water to build the lather\n* = 6 passes of lather.\n\nBowl - I used the XL version of this 3D-printable bowl:\nhttps://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3392930\n\n#### ❧ Brush Notes\n*^(Elite Razor - Manchurian Fan CravingShaving Blue/White 26mm‹10 uses›)*\n\nI liked this brush a lot better today. I had put a spacer in to raise the knot about 3mm or so. This was just enough to relax the backbone of the knot to a place where I like it. Much better feel today. Looking forward to using this brush again in the future.\n\n----\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: A little irritating\n*Neck*: A little irritating\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Very Close Shave\n*Neck*: Many hairs show whisker tips with a little length to them\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm) *and also in the sub's sidebar.*\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

I've come to really love this scent. Will has mentioned in the past that the synthetic amber note that is put with a lot of aquatic fougeres is obnoxious to him. I still own a few of those frags and like them, but I've started to notice that note more frequently, and there's something a little softer or more mellow about Waves that allows the sea notes to shine through. I really like it. Happy Saturday, all.",

It's meaning the shaves have less irritation and I get to shave more often, it's a win win really. I might not get BBS but I wasn't ever really hitting that without giving me loads of irritation.\n\nToday's shave was great, smooth and irritation free. Fourth and Pine is one of my favourite soaps, the base performs great and the scent is amazing. Decided to try pairing this with Sundrunk which is another super citrusy fragrance, lots of the notes are very similar but the composition comes off more orange-y to me, definitely work well together.\n\nThere's not much more to say really, amazing shave one I'll be happy to go back to time and time again.",

I'll get used to it a few times before trying against/across the grain. The alum burnt me a bit.\n\nHappy Sunday!",

This is only my second foray into Tallow and Steel, the first of which being Merchandise 7X so I don't really count that one. I'll hafta say that I'm pretty well pleased by this set. The soap performs well, with enough slickness and cushion and my face felt pretty nice afterward, but of course I slapped on the aftershave and that's the product of theirs that really shines in my opinion. It toes that line between slight alcohol tingle and nourishing my skin that not too many do. As for the scent, I don't think I've smelled anything like it before. It's a smoky, woody scent with something else going on in the background that I can't quite figure out but I definitely do enjoy quite a bit! I'm still not reading scent notes, so I'll give it another shot or two before I give in and see what's really in it. Overall pretty damn nice shave this morning.",

It is an efficient razor though. And I don't find it to be anything resembling harsh. It actually gives a comfortable shave.\n\nThis soap is a sample from /u/Cadinsor. I have never used Le père Lucien before today. It is hard to get an accurate feel for a soap with just one shave, but I can say that I liked it a lot. It doesn't seem to be a really thirsty soap like Reserve and some others. I think I may have started with too wet of a brush because the soap foamed up immediately. I worked that down a bit and couldn't believe how much lather I got from such a small amount of soap. This sample is going to last me possibly three weeks of shaves.\n\nI do not know what the scent is, but to my nose it is towards the spicy. The performance is excellent. Very slick with a decent amount of residual slickness for buffing. Post shave feel is above average. This one is a thumbs up. Ima use up the small amount of soap in my boar over the next couple of days then move on to the next sample.",

As I was enjoying the fragrance of my lather I was thinking that the Desairology splash would go perfect with it. I started digging around through my stuff only to remember that I'm a big dummy and only bought the soap and EdP. I went with the SW Lavender splash and it was just fine.\n\n\nAs I continue my month of Shavette shaving I'm getting better and better shaves each day. I switched from Feather to Personna and really like this blade a lot more with this razor.\n\nGot a long drive up to Los Angeles today.

So good!\n\n#### ❧ Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Gillette - Fat Boy Setting 7 ::: Gillette - Nacet ‹158 uses›)*\n\nA comfortable shave, but not as close of a shave as usual this time on my trouble spots. I'll have to get back to the Sheraton and see how this old codger of a blade will do.\n\n#### ❧ Soap Notes\n*^(L&L Grooming Bison Tallow - Trismegistus)*\n\nThem: \"Featuring top notes of grapefruit and orange, accented by heart notes of flint, pink peppercorn, geranium, and supported by base notes of benzoin, vetiver, and cedar\"\n\nScent: I can get the citrus, and a hint of pepper (nicely done), and a little woodiness, but not much of the vetiver. But the maturity of this scent came out when my AS was a Drakkar Noir dupe, which was much lighter and floral/fruity with less of a base.\n\nThis scent is an instant favorite.\n\nScent Strength: 5/10, nicely present during shaving.\n\nLather: creamy slick excellent awesome, as we all know\n\n* 25 second load with lightly-wet, large, badger brush\n* 3.5 tsp water to build the lather\n* = 4 passes of lather.\n\nBowl - I used the XL version of this 3D-printable bowl:\nhttps://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3392930\n\n#### ❧ Brush Notes\n*^(Elite Razor - Manchurian Fan CravingShaving Blue/White 26mm‹11 uses›)*\n\nReally enjoying this guy. splays easily now, and just feels good.\n\n----\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Few hairs are showing some tip length (with most being cut flush)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm) *and also in the sub's sidebar.*\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

I think it's my favorite of the half dozen I've sniffed or tried. Inspired by blooming spring meadows, it has strong floral top notes (violet, jasmine, freesia, lavender) on a base of sandalwood and labdanum. I would describe it as pretty strictly floral, but having a mixture of different floral notes that range from sweet to spicy means that it's not too one-dimensional. I like it. I wonder if /u/RuggerRigger is still thinking of selling his tub...\n\nYesterday I used Haverford and a Tobacco Vanille clone oil (an unsolicited gift from a friend). They both smelled good and they didn't quite match each other. I don't imagine that they match the real thing either, considering how many cologne dupes I've tried and how few (zero) were TRULY a dead ringer for the real thing (whether it be a soap, aftershave, perfume, etc). Setting questions of accuracy and the ethics of duping fragrances aside, they both smelled good. The soap's scent struck me as generally a good choice for winter, and the fragrance oil specifically smelled like a house decorated for Christmas with seasonal spices wafting out of the kitchen. Neither of them are really my jam so I don't think I'm going to try tracking down a sample of the real stuff, considering how hard perfume samples can be to find in Canada if your local stores don't sell that product.\n\nToday I'm trying out the divisive Azzaro Wanted but I haven't put it on yet... gotta get grocery shopping with the wife out of the way before I \"put on [my] stinks\" as she says. People who enjoy it say it smells good. People who dislike it mostly complain that it smells too much like other fragrances. I've only smelled it on blotter cards so far so I don't have a clear assessment of it yet. I'll post my thoughts later.",

WTG, XTG, and another XTG clean up. The cream felt good on the skin; this is one of the slickest lather out there. However, the lack of cushion and visible lather knocks it down a bit in terms of enjoyability. Used my hands to lather so it was a bit annoying having to wash the lather everytime. Razor + blade felt great. One of the mildest razor but still very efficient. Mild post shave + creamy Stirling balm to wrap it up.\n\nI'm thinking of using the Maca Root shave cream + BodyShop synthetic brush tomorrow. That should be a lovely combination unless the brush is stiff. From the looks/feels of it, it seems pretty good. I'll keep the razor+blade the same and add the alum block to finish. Nothing on the mail call as I have some traveling to do. I can definitely take a break on the purchases, haha.",

Harris - Sandalwood - Soap](https://trythatsoap.com/collection/263/?product_type=soap)\n* **Post Shave:** Henri et Victoria - Sandalwood post-shave balm\n\n\nToday I revisited the D.R. shave stick, an item I haven't had a ton of success with. The problem stems entirely from underloading, and that's because it is triple-milled and difficult to rub/apply to the face. Maybe difficult isn't the right word... tedious? I spent the better part of a minute rubbing it onto my face, all over, all looking pasty white. When I thought I was done, I did another round. I began my face-lather and it did do a fine job transforming into lather, quickly I might add. I got a very good lather using this method, and enough for 3 passes. I stupidly did a stroke over a cut on my neck without thinking, it re-opened a bit. I might forego shaving for a few days so it can heal. This will be a good week, 4 days followed by a weekend getaway with the guys.\n\nLife is short, shave with good gear.",

Not sure I'm quite ready for work, but at least there's a sense of normalcy I get from it. First shave in the new house which I'm exceptionally excited about, not just because of a new sink and environment, but because of the soft water I now get to enjoy. Been looking forward to soft water shaves for years and now I've finally got them.\n\nHave a great Monday and week, folks!",

If you haven't tried their soaps yet because you are afraid of some of the scent profiles, this one is a safe bet. It's woody and floral to my nose and very pleasant. I don't know if I would put it in the barbershop category per se, but it does pair well with Clubman (the quintessential barber scent for me) so there's that. The soap performs very well as most of you know by now so no issues there. The jury is still out on Fougere Aromatique. Not sure if I like this one or not. I think I prefer Imperiale. A great shave to kick off the work week at any rate.",

Yesterday I said it was pretty strictly floral, but on further thought there's a little bit of earthiness in there from the sandalwood. DG's Bison base is pretty well respected for good reason. Thick, smooth, slick, etc. Doesn't dry my skin out right now but I've got a hunch it might need a little help from balms instead of splashes once the winter hits. One thing I like is that it's flexible like Glissant and Stirling: you can whip up a quick and dirty lather in zero time if you know how much water to start with in your brush and just hit the ground running, OR you can take your time to really work that lather down into a perfect fine foam and keep adding more and more water for a more luxurious shave. Overall I'm giving this a tentative SpongeScore of 7/10 but it might get bumped up to 8/10 at some point. Or I might bump Le Grande Chypre down to 7/10 to match this one. Not sure yet.\n\nMy final \"miscellaneous scents\" fragrance that I couldn't lump in with a more cohesive group (based on staring at a list of scent notes) is the venerable and ever popular Eternity for Men. I feel betrayed. The bottle on this stuff is fuckin' u-u-u-u-ugly (see: user flair)... and how here I am, 30 minutes into wearing it and really enjoying the stuff. Lovely classic lavender & citrus barbershop opening and now I can detect some geranium and fresh calone creeping in. It's one of those early '90s fresh-fougère compositions with 18+ notes so I expect that within about an hour the heart is going to get pretty difficult to describe, but it's good so far. Edit: Those oodles of other notes must be playing a pretty subtle role in this composition. It feels like a fairly lavender/calone centric fragrance a couple hours in. Every once in a while I get a splash of lily.\n\nIf you want to read a little more about Eternity *right now* instead of waiting for later, [scroll down on this page and read Zealot Crusader's mini-essay.](http://www.basenotes.net/fragrancereviews/fragrance/26120591) Dude's prose gets pretty pompous sometimes but damn does he ever know his fragrance history and I think this is one of his better constructed reviews.",

Certainly stiff enough to lather Tabac, and a very efficient and comfy lather dispenser. Forms an unsightly donut as it dries after the shave due to the mid-range density, but this is not much of an issue, save for those that obsessively stare at their brushes as they dry.\n\n**Lather:** Tabac is probably the best mass produced tallow soap, in the same way that the Packers are the best football team that plays in Wisconsin. Excellent glide and protection, but needs a good post shave to help the visage recover and prosper. I've had an on again / off again relationship with Tabac's performance, but today all was spot on.\n\nAnd the scent? Very polarizing, but I love it. When I was a wee lad, my mum would drag me along with her to the beauty parlor when she got her hair done, and I generally loathed the entire experience. There was this particular hair spray that smelled exactly like Tabac, and I hated that damned scent at the time.\n\nNow though, many years after my mom's passing, I find Tabac has become a pleasant reminder of those days. Objectively, the scent is a weird floral leather thing that is hit or miss for those without olfactory nostalgic reminiscence in effect.\n\n**Razor:** The Windsor remains an efficient shaver, quick and comfy, tames the blade quite a bit and the weight is well balanced. Interestingly, the non-chattery head does a superlative job with ATG passes, probably not a coincidence.\n\n**Blade:** Permasharp works OK for me, not a great one. As sharp and efficient as a Poli, and seems to last as long, but the shave is considerably harsher and actually brings down my FAYS score (immediate post shave comfort assessment) for any soap used with it. The search for the cheap Polsilver replacement continues...\n\n**Frag:** Has all the leather of Tabac, but chooses spices rather than florals as the middle notes, and so is more palatable to most dudes. Is this a cold weather only scent? I think not, but that's just me.",

But there was some burning upon splash application.\n\nI love the Valencia scent, but the lather was a little finicky on first use. I tried loading with a little more water this time and it seemed to do the trick. The soap isn't super thick, but it has great slickness. I guess that's \"low structure\" if we're using technical terms. The post shave feel is really damn good, but I love my post shaves so applied splash and my favorite post shave lotion to date.\n\nHappy Monday y'all - ugh, work",

And though this was a quick, no-nonsense shave, because i was so wiped at the end of a trip, that it still impressed!\n\nAnd then my first visit to the Gatsby series that came out this summer. West Egg ... A muted scent, but I enjoyed it.\n\n#### ❧ Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Fine Accoutrements - Marvel ::: Gillette - Nacet ‹159 uses›)*\n\nSurprisingly, the Marvel handled well, very well. I wondered if it would, since it curves the blade more than some. The shave had a little more of a scrapey feel to it... just a little... than usual, since the Marvel isn't supporting the bottom of the blade as close to the edge as many razors I enjoy.\n\nBut whatever... it worked.\n\n#### ❧ Soap Notes\n*^(Storybook Soapworks - West Egg)*\n\nThem: \"white grape note with the sparkling aldehydes that were so common in perfumery during the Roaring 20s along with fruity notes and oakwood extract\"\n\nScent: I got the grape, and I think the aldehydes, and a little bit of the oakwood if I stuck my nose in the bowl. It really did give a champagne vibe. I like it.\n\nScent Strength: 4/10, lightly present during shaving.\n\nGreat lather with this soap. Nice and slick and can hold lots of water and stay elastic.\n\n* 30 sec load w/lightly-wet dense badger brush\n* 6 tsp water to build the lather\n* = 6 passes of lather.\n\nBowl - I used the XL version of this bowl:\nhttps://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3392930\n\n#### ❧ Brush Notes\n*^(Maseto - Memphis Finest 24mm‹2 uses›)*\n\nMedium backbone, but nice soft tips, and long enough loft make me enjoy this one so far.\n\n----\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Very Close Shave\n*Neck*: Few hairs are showing some tip length (with most being cut flush)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm) *and also in the sub's sidebar.*\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

Oleo's performance feels like it's not quite up to the other three. Perhaps I used to much water 🤷♂️, but the lather feels more thin and airy than the rest. Still slick, but not quite on the level of Bufflehead or GD. Easy to load, though, unlike Mammoth. I'd like to use all the bases again to get a more thorough comparison.",

I picked up this set during the lather games and have been absolutely itching to use it. It smells amazing, but more on that later.\n\nThis new brush of mine has been fantastic too. It loaded incredibly easily and lathered smoothly. Plus, it's gorgeous.\n\nOverall, I prefer Icarus to the Bison base, but there is something to be said about Bison's ease of use. This lather took like a total of a minute to get dialed in, and it performed excellently.\n\nPure Lavender is an interesting scent because it only has one scent note--lavender--but it feels like it has a layer of complexity. Shawn's description indicates that there are four different strains of lavender included, so that's probably where it comes from. It isn't too dry or artificial, but while other lavender scents (like [Talbot's Mount Ventoux](https://trythatsoap.com/collection/1187/?product_type=soap) as a recent example) combat this with including other notes (Rosemary, in Mount Ventoux's case) Pure Lavendar does so with just lavender.",

I was really looking forward to this shave today.\n\nMan, if you guys have not tried Caron Pour Un Homme Sport, it really is something. If you haven' tried the original and are a lavender fan, I would highly recommend it. The original has the following scent notes\n\n**Top note**: lavender\n\n**Middle note**: vanilla\n\n**base note**: musk.\n\nThe Sport Version is different from other Sport flankers in that it does not seem to be created with the intention of being a \"gym\" or \"athletic\" male fragrance. While the original was a more calming and soothing scent, this has a more vibrant, go do stuff sort of effect. The note breakdown is\n\n**Top notes**: citruses, grapefruit, italian mandarin, lemon verbena and lavender;\n\n**middle notes**: ginger, nutmeg and virginian cedar;\n\n**base notes**: tonka bean, benzoin, ambergris and white musk.\n\nYou still get that sweet, soothing lavender in the drydown, which I find really amazing in a \"Sport\" flanker.\n\nCheers!",

I always forget about this soap as it's sitting hidden away in a Marvy mug, but it's such a fantastic performer for the price- very slick, and easy to work in to lather (thankfully, as I worked arms in the gym right before this). It dries a bit easy if you let it sit, but that's a minor issue that's easy to resolve.\n\nHappy Monday, folks!",

The leather smell is really nostalgic for me and just seems to work. Plus, my wife loves it, which is a plus. The lather was slick and provided a good shave. I was in a bit of a hurry and only did one pass, plus a little clean up. Overall an okay shave.\n\nI cannot say that I like Pinaud Clubman. I purchased it to replace the bay rum that I was using, and loved. Clubman is a bit too... something... It seems to really assault my nose and reminds my of my grandmothers bathroom when I was a kid.

WTG, XTG, and another XTG clean up. The cream felt slick and creamy; it was a touch on the airy side but as I lathered it more, it became fuller. Brush was soft but stiff and rough on the scrubbing. I had one of the few brush burns today so I have to be careful with this one. Razor + blade felt great as they continued the mild and efficient path. Mild post shave and creamy balm to wrap it all up.\n\nI'm liking the BodyShop duos. I'm thinking of bowl lathering with the synthetic so that I can use the painting motion on my face instead of face lathering it. As for mail calls, there will be none for a while. I'll be travel to GA so I'll be on a hiatus for SOTDs as well. I'll see you guys in couple of weeks! Meanwhile, I'm getting my travel shave set up ready.",

Its been a great performer but the scent isn't really for me. I'm still undecided on Fougeres in general but the floral aspect of this one just isn't for me. I didn't really have much post shave to pair with this so reached for the Cade which I haven't used in a while. Its a great balm, nice at thick and absorbs easily.\n\nThe Gilette Silver Blues continue to be a great blade, I can get a couple more shaves out of them than I can other blades, once I've finished the rest of the various blade packs I have lying around I'll definitely be looking for a bulk order of these.\n\nI'm loving this fragrance at the moment, the citrus start with a slightly musty dirty dry down is a great smell. Its a great summer scent without being a fresh clean citrus. Nice simple quick shave with no irritation. Great!",

First, the R41. I received this one in a recent PIF by u/rChewbacca during the Lather Games. Although I don't think this is the \"infamous\" R41 from a few years back, this one still had a bite to it. I think I would compare the blade feel of this one to perhaps a 7 or 8 plate if there was one for a Rockwell 6S. Even with that, the DFS shave was effortless. I'll do a BBS tomorrow to see how this one does ATG, but I suspect that I won't have any problems at all.\n\nNext up for this is the Storybook Soapworks Chasing Sunsets. u/Fahrenheit915 was nice enough to make a batch of this for the SoCal wetshavers meetup. I'm still a bit bummed that I wasn't able to attend, but I'm absolutely in love with this scent. Bonus points for it being a homage to where I was born and raised, SoCal. To me, the scent is like a citrus forward aquatic. It may sound odd, but it reminded me of sipping mimosas at the [Lighthouse Cafe](https://lighthousenb.com/) located in Newport Beach. This was also my first full tub of Storybook Soapworks and I'm pleasantly surprised by its performance. The softness of the soap threw me off at first (similar to Catie's Bubbles luxury cream in consistency), but this thing whipped up a mean lather. I never once felt it lacking in slickness or cushion even when using it to test out the R41 for the first time.",

If nothing else at least I don't have razor burn. The silver blue blade seem to be a nice pairing. And finally, can't go wrong with a classic splash like Fine's American blend.

I used is my prize for placing in the LG. I'll admit that there were some other great prizes that went before me, but u/rocketk455 really hooked me up with some amazing stuff! I had a sample from last year that I used for one day in the games that didn't REALLY do it for me. It was good, but there was just something there that I wasn't a fan of afterward. I actually pulled my sample out a bit ago and sniffed to figure it out. There was this undertone of almost a clay scent just hanging out that kept it from reaching the heights that this new version of SBS has attained. This shit is amazing and now I really don't wanna go to fuckin work y'all. I'd much rather drink cocktails out by a pool somewhere and that's what this scent really puts me in mind of. It opens up with this sweetness of pineapple with that little chlorine pinch in the background that sounds steaming but works perfectly in this. The aftershave continues the dancing scent notes as well as prolonging that good synthetic menthol chill for a lot longer than the soap alone. Another set I don't think I'll ever be able to be without, at least in the summer. I put macaque on top of it, because 1: it's one of my sweeter drags that I figured would go well and 2: I wanted to say I put macaque on top of it. And ya know what? Macaque is good. Macaque is life. Ok, maybe not life, but definitely good. Macaque almost swells as you drink in the essence, especially for the first time before you get accustomed to the size of it. Mmmm. You need some macaque. Everyone should at least try macaque. Ok. I'm done. At least, unless someone wants macaque? Then I guess just PM me and maybe we can work something out.",

Smooth as heck.\n\nThis scent reminds me of a \"eau de cologne\" that my mum put into the cold water towel she applied to my forehead when I had high fevers. It's a bright citrus scent that I didn't quite like at first but I'm starting to warm up to..\n\nThe AS toner from CL is very good in terms of feel however, the scent is a little like the citrus scented cleaning agents used in restrooms when first applied. Once dry, it settles down very nicely to a mellow citrus that I really enjoyed. I think the EdP would actually be a good idea for a summer scent.\n\nOverall I'm really happy with this set. Nacet going strong, B7 kicking ass and Karve gliding well.\n\nEnjoy your Tuesday!",

Or more specifically, citrus scents that are not also permeated with lavender or aquatic notes, because those ones are scheduled for later in the month. First showdown will be two sweet fragrances that feature citrus & **almond** notes, so it's time to break out the **CELLA**. It's sweet and marzipany and makes me think of candied cherries and Shirley Temples. Mmmmm. I bet a Shirley Temple shave soap would smell delicious... orange, lemon, lime, ginger, almond, cherry, pomegranate, and a hint of rose, neroli, and vanilla. Soap makers: you're welcome. [I'll be waiting for my royalty cheques.](https://memegenerator.net/img/instances/70351658/shut-up-and-give-me-money.jpg)\n\nL'Homme Lacoste (\"the Lacoste man\") is another one of [those fragrances](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Azzaro/Azzaro-Pour-Homme-Night-Time-13965.html) that opens with opens with orange and [rhubarb](https://i.imgur.com/2ixS6hx.jpg) and [that excites me](https://www.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/cafurn/happy_feet/). Top notes include mandarin, rhubarb, orange, and quince (sort of an apple-pear scent); there's a heart of ginger and almond with hints of pepper and jasmine; and a base of primarily vanilla and woody notes. Looking forward to seeing how it handles today.",

I have only used WCS duck fat soap so this was a new experience for me. I noticed this soap required a bit more water when loading, but it gave me a very nice lather once it got going. I enjoyed the clean scent of Picture Day very much. It also left my skin very moisturized which I quite liked. As for the shave- I went with a 2 pass on cheek and neck then hit the cheeks for my first ATG pass. Another DFS and my cheeks have never felt smoother. Will keep at it and continue to improve my technique.",

The General is a very efficient and gentle razor, and the ProGuard is equally mild and competent. ProGuards cost more than Schick Prolines, and are not proportionally better shavers, so the PG is in third place in my Teeny Hall of AC Blade Rankings, with the Proline and Kai Captain Mild Titan tied for first, and the Feather Pro and then the Super rounding out the Top Five (indeed the Only Five) list for me.\n\n**Lather:** This is really a clever and unique use of vetiver, truly making the familiar seem exotic. Not everyone will love this scent - it's very formal and complex - but those misguided souls who normally loathe vetiver may just like the way the scent is used here.\n\n**Frag:** A scent for all seasons and settings, APH sadly has tripled in price over the last two years or so, for unknown reasons. Don't know if I could recommend it at the current price, especially as Lauder's quite similar Tuscany has remained as cheap as APH used to be.\n\n**Brush:** Nice job from the occasionally stingy 26mm Elite Manchurian bulb today. Indeed, the last few shaves on this knot have all been efficient and issue-free. Has this knot finally broken in three years later?",

I ordered a sample from Maggard's last week, and finally got around to trying it out.\n\nOne thing that I noticed right away (not sure if this is just a batch difference) was that the sample was much softer than other soaps from SW. The sample I received was more like a croap (probably a little softer than the bison base from Declaration Grooming). This didn't seem to change the resulting lather in any way though, and I got a very efficient and smooth shave.\n\nThe scent is a fairly sweet take on the barbershop genre. Even though the notes are mostly different, there's a quality that reminded me a lot of Zoologist's Hummingbird. With Hummingbird, there's a strong gourmand fruit element that rests on a base of florals. Desairology has a sweet citrus vanilla notes that rest on the typical powdery lavender/oakmoss/musk/sandalwood. In my book, this is definitely a strong contender for \"best barbershop\" fragrance in wetshaving, and I'll be ordering the EdP and aftershave soon.",

It's definitely as good as many of the other more popular top tier soaps. Very slick, dense, and creamy lather. Another one that you have to be careful not to overload or you'll be adding buckets of water to get the right consistency.\n\nI finished the shave with a tester sample of Noble Otter's upcoming balm. This iteration is a little bit liquidy with a consistency slightly thicker than say Nivea, which isn't really an issue. It applies and absorbs easily to provide a smooth and nourishing post shave. I'm told that the actual texture will be a bit thicker when it is released. Great stuff as always from Noble Otter.\n\nSantal Auster is a wonderful sandalwood scent that pairs well with the woody notes of LNHC Coconut Oud. This is my first time actually wearing it and I've noticed that it dries down into something much different than what you smell out of the bottle. It's a very natural, smooth , and creamy sandalwood bolstered by the oud, incense, and patchouli notes. A masterful blend to say the least.",

Luckily, the alcohol burns off very quickly, so the \"smells like a drink\" phase of this fragrance only lasts about 20-30 seconds.\n\nAfter the initial alcohol blast, the whiskey is still present, but not as sharp as it was initially, and citrus (lemon or lime), ginger, and bitter join the party. So far, I think the bitters note steals the show being very pleasant, but a little exotic and hard to place. The ginger note is also a really nice, spicy ginger. I think this is my only fragrance with a strong ginger note, and I really like it.\n\nI applied this frag about an hour ago, so I haven't had a chance to see how it develops over the course of the day.\n\nThanks again to u/hawns and u/whiskyey for all the work that went into the Feats of Fragrance contest and the great prize!",

So, are dupes and homages in any way \"worse\" in my book? No. As long as there's no irritants or problems with the product do I care if it's made of EO's or not? Not really.\n\nEspecially for niche fragrance houses that don't have the exposure, I feel it's a gateway or a first foray for people, a percentage of whom may like the scents so much they actually pick up a bottle of the real stuff.\n\nThe performance of this soap is fabulous. I personally would recommend having the club or Ariana and Evans in every collection.",

I've seen Tempest listed a lot on BST and was tempted to pull the trigger a couple times, since I really enjoy Summer Storm. I found the scent on Tempest to be less strong and distinctive (I barely picked up any scent in 2nd and 3rd pass). That said, I would rate the performance of the WK soap base a bit higher. Very sticky and viscous lather. Standout on this shave for me was the scent on the WCS Chypre splash. I'm a fan of citrus scents and this one seems to land right in the middle of the spectrum between two of my favorites from Chatillon Lux--dirtier and earthier than Delor de Treget, but still a bit brighter/sharper than 4th & Pine. Not sure if this interpretation is broadly representative of the Chypre scent, but I definitely like it and will seek out more examples of it. Of course I had to add in some SBS Icy Stare just to give me the cooling kick that I've come to crave. Will probably use this combo the next few days until I finish out this WK sample.",

Deep Blue Sea\n\nPost: Stirling Soap Co. Deep Blue Sea\n\n\nIt was nice to use a badger brush that I actually like for tonight's shave having been on a synthetic kick as of late. As for the soap and AS, I've been loving cologne type and cologne dupe scents more and more the further I get into this hobby. Deep Blue Sea is an homage to Bleu de Chanel, and while I haven't smelled the original cologne, it's quite nice to be sure. I can't say it's my favorite scent ever, but it's definitely something I can see being a mainstay in my rotation.",

Really love this scent and glad I have it in the rotation.\n\nGetting better with my chin angles and worked a lot on making sure I wasn't using too much pressure today. Think I found some spots where I was working the razor too hard that might be leading to some irritation on my neck. Will see how it does today.\n\nHappy Hump Day!",

I thought for sure that I would use up the small amount of the sample that I put in the bowl on Sunday long before today. Even with the DG brush there is still one more shave left. It takes so very little of this soap per shave.\n\nSpeaking of DG brushes, this one has pretty much ended my search for the perfect badger. This is the one. The end.",

My hybrid handle is off with Rob getting some repairs and I'll be hearing back from him soon. In the mean time I'm using the other of his brushes that I own.\n\nToday I felt like trying out a new blade. I received some Voskhod blades with my TDR brush and wanted to give them a try. I had about two days growth today and the blad handled it well with just a very little tug in some of the denser areas.\n\nAnyway, hope everyone has a wonderful day!",

I think I've done it. I think I found the winning combination! Electric Sheep plus ACoF is the shit. It's an olfactory camping trip in a nutshell. The addition of the burning matches and wood to the citronella scent is perfection. The fragrance doesn't completely overshadow the soap and aftershave scent, but instead they seem to build off of each other and it WORKS. Seriously. If you have access to both things, try it. You're welcome in advance.",

Cheap, available, excellent shave performance, quick and easy to use. Only needs a hint of face food post-shave in the summer (i.e., Aqua Velva is fine with its hint of glycerin, Skin Bracer isn't quite up to the task with its pure alcohol / water / menthol / perfume / food coloring recipe) but definitely needs a balm in the winter for my dry skin. You can go quick and dirty with the stuff and get shaving in a jiffy, but if you put in the same kind of lather-building effort that you'd give some of the elite artisan soaps, you'll be rewarded with a beautiful, thick, slick, protective lather that's right at home with a lot of soaps costing almost twice as much. I love the scent but it's pretty mild. Overall it gets a SpongeScore of 6/10. If the post shave were a little better or the scent were a little stronger it would be a 7 for me.\n\nIt is, by the way, my personal benchmark for judging artisan soaps. I ask myself, \"does this perform and smell at least as good as Cella?\" Because if it doesn't beat Cella at $13 CAD / 5 oz then it's literally not worth the prices that artisans charge.\n\nFollowing yesterday's L'Homme Lacoste is Guerlain's \"L'Homme Ideal Cologne\" (The Ideal Man Cologne). I feel like it's going to be in a pretty similar vein with its citrus and almond over a woody base, but it'll likely be somewhat lighter and sweeter. It's supposed to have a stronger almond note than the Lacoste. I'll report back later, as usual with colognes that I'm trying for the first time. Ciao!",

I got hooked up with a used tub at a very reasonable price. My first impression is that it was a bit quick to dry on my face but I think I didn't add enough water. The post shave was great and I didn't have any nicks whatsoever so I can't ask for much more. Very mild scent but definitely meant to be bright and spring-like.\n\nI'm a huge fanboy for Elite Razors knots. This one has great backbone, no scritch and doesn't gobble up all of my lather like most high density knots.\n\nI use balms about 80% of the time but in the summer that's a risky proposition. This Stirling balm leaves my face feeling great but hasn't had to compete against 90° and humid yet so we'll see if I'm still happy with it after my walk from the metro station to the office.",

      "body": "Wednesday 7/10 SOTD\n\n· **Brush**: WCS 26mm \"tall\" synth\n\n· **Lather**: Talbot Gates of the Arctic\n\n· **Razor**: Colonial General SS AC razor\n\n· **Blade**: Feather ProGuard (2)\n\n· **Post**: Kramperts Frostbite splash\n\n· **Frag**: Givenchy Xeryus Rouge\n\n**Product Notes:**\n\n**Brush**: Got this to get free shipping on the Talbot, and ended up being quite impressed. Site makes the usual hoodoo claims that this is \"improved BOSS fiber V2\", but I think what we have here is simply a very dense knot with middling to tall loft - the density gives backbone, and the loft gives splay. 26mm is a relatively unusual size for synths, but this diameter works quite well for me, better than most 24mm synths. The handle is a two tone resin / acrylic combo, and the brush is quite heavy at around 112g. A very nice deal for less than $18!\n\n**Lather:** Talbot does interesting things with their scents, claiming natural scent portraits but then ending up with really complex \"perfumey\" scents that would don most niche houses proud, Gates is no exception, offering a delightful green and woodsy palette with hints of aquatic notes. It's sweet and green and fresh all at the same time, suggesting nature bursting forth in spring.\n\nPerformance is excellent, a FAYS score of 90 for me (face felt very good though not great after shave and before cold water and post shave). The container is only three ounces, so we are looking at a price of $5 per ounce, which is becoming pretty standard in the artisanal world.\n\nThe label art is very nice, a more colorful and inventive design than is usual for Talbot, though the packaging a bit blah, using the low, small, plastic cheapies that Tiki and Strop Shoppe (among many others) used to offer for their product.\n\n**Razor / Blade:** Another quick and smooth shave, with a \"scorched earth\" BBS that will last for 12 hours or more and yet one that felt absolutely painless when in the process. AC blade shaving continues to hold much appeal, especially as long as my favored DE, Polsilvers, are going for seventy cents per blade from most sellers.\n\n**Post:** A more conventional olfactory portrait of Alaska - one that is very cold! Great way to start a hot summers day, and a celebration of the best of the Old School of shaving facial cool-downs. Can Terror unseat the champion?\n\n**Frag:** One of the most unusual of masculines, offering peppers, cactus, and African geranium notes. Smells weirdly like green, spicy, berries with a bit of woods and amber in the base. I like this as a summer scent, but it has a lot of oomph to it, which some may think is seasonally inappropriate. I contend it smells a lot better than armpit, which is a far more common scent on the subways at this time of year.",

I always thought it should have been higher. It's really easy to lather but also very rewarding if you spend time to dial it in.\n\nI was more excited to try out the Wild West Brushworks handle with 24mm SHD fan knot. I had read great things about the SHD knots and wanted to try one out. I've only done a few test lathers prior to today's shave and still don't consider it fully broken in. I'm really liking it for its price point since the total cost for both the handle and knot was less than $100.\n\nThe knot itself feels dense, soft and had little to no funk out the box. The 24mm fan knot definitely felt more like a 26mm. The tips are gelling a bit which had me loading a little longer to pick up more lather. I don't chase gel tip knots but it's always nice to have variety in the den. I'm happy with it so far and looking forward to see how it breaks in.",

How about that.\n\nAlso trying out Padre Leone for the first time. A little subtle, but I really enjoyed it.\n\n#### ❧ Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Gillette - Goodwill 160 ::: Gillette - Nacet ‹160 uses›)*\n\nThis is an aggressive razor. I had to ride the cap to keep it under control. I managed to escape any cuts or nicks, and even any kind of irritation or razor burn. But it was tenuous.\n\nI don't really know if I want to try a fresh blade in this guy.\n\n#### ❧ Soap Notes\n*^(Wholly Kaw Tallow - Padre Leone)*\n\nThem: \"Bergamot, Petitgrain, Lavender, Clary Sage, Neroli, Tarragon with a blend of white florals on a base of Amber, Vetiver, Immortelle and subtle Musk.\"\n\nScent: I could smell the orange and the florals, and probably the musk, but I'm sure the vetiver and other ingredients were helping to contribute to the sophistication of the scent. A manly scent, that I really enjoyed.\n\nA person, like me, who doesn't like floral-dominant scents, should not be concerned about this one. I thought it was warm (though not so much that you couldn't use it all year long), classy, and very interesting.\n\nThe sage is also another element that I usually don't like, but in this accord it is used as a supporting element and is not bothersome at all.\n\nScent Strength: 4/10, lightly present during shaving.\n\nLather: This is an excellent base that is super slippery and easy to bring up to lather. Creamy feels during rinsing and so slick!\n\n* 30 second load with lightly-wet, big badger brush\n* 3 tsp water to build the lather\n* = 5 passes of lather.\n\nBowl - I used the XL version of this 3D-printable bowl:\nhttps://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3392930\n\n#### ❧ Brush Notes\n*^(Stirling - Finest in CravingShaving Blue Slate 26mm‹9 uses›)*\n\nSoft tips, but a little hard to splay. Still enjoyable to use, though. Will look forward to seeing this guy in more uses.\n\n----\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: A little irritating\n*Neck*: A little irritating\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Very Close Shave\n*Neck*: Few hairs are showing some tip length (with most being cut flush)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm) *and also in the sub's sidebar.*\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

      "body": "[July 10](https://i.imgur.com/cDh3s73.jpg)\n\nLather: Long Rifle Brown Bess\nBrush: Mühle Silvertip Fibre v2\nRazor: Rockwell 6S\nBlade: Voskhod\nPost: Long Rifle Brown Bess Shave Tonic\n\nI always considered myself someone who tried to buy local, so I was surprised to learn there a soap maker in Wisconsin I'd never heard of before.\n\nSo after trolling their website a bit (locally-sourced tallow!), I placed an order for two pucks of soap, Brown Bess and Hawkeye. Two days later, I received the soaps in the mail along with a generously-added sample of their shave tonic.\n\nToday's my first chance to give their stuff a try.\n\nOff the puck, Brown Bess smells like black cherry and leather. Lathering sends the cherry to the background and brings up the pipe tobacco. The end result is a pleasant smell reminiscent of cherry pipe tobacco. The leather is a little harder to notice.\n\nThe lather is fairly thirsty, but make a dense yogurty lather with great cushion. The slickness is good, but not lingering. You can't squeak in a cleanup pass on a spot you've shaved; you need to either relather or push some lather from somewhere else.\n\nThe lather rinses clean easily, and post-shave skin feel is excellent. I really didn't feel like I needed anything more, but I wanted to try the tonic.\n\nI used about a quarter of the little sample vial, and it went on totally painlessly, which was a shock. I was expecting at least a little something in the burn department, but was pleasantly surprised to get nothing at all.\n\nSo I checked the ingredients list - witch hazel, aloe liquid, coconut oil and grain alcohol with various extracts. I wonder if grain alcohol instead of isopropyl takes the sting away?\n\nThe tonic left my face practically dewey. Great hydration without feeling greasy or overdone. The scent is significant but not overwhelming - I can rely on my daughters to comment if I've gone to far, and they liked it.\n\nThis is a solid soap and splash combo, I'll be working it and Hawkeye for a few shaves to see if I get it dialed in any better.",

Went faster and smoother than the first go, but that could also be attributed to the soap- has previously used Cremo concentrated shave cream and it felt a tiny bit gritty as opposed to the slickness I got from the Sterling. The soap was easy to lather and smelled decent albeit a bit weak (dont know if this is the norm being my first experience with the company) but resulted in a nice shave overall. Nice light compliment to CDNIM and overall happy with the product.\n\nOn a side note- being brand new to saftey razors does anyone know what razors/blades bigfoot shaves rebranded? It feels like a solid piece and gave a relatively smooth shave just curious of the parent company.",

It's sort of a 'greatest hits' type album, so there's lots missing, but it's a good collection nonetheless.\n\nMan, Arctique really gets me! It hurts when I shave, and the aftershave makes me cry, and blinds me for a good 5 minutes. I've tried using less product to minimize blindness, but even if it only blind for a minute, my eyes still water for a bit lol. The soap isn't as cold as Cryogen soap, but then again I can't even use Cryogen soap because it hurts my face. The strange thing about all this is that while arctique splash is colder, I can still use it whereas I can't use Cryogen soap. Go figure.\n\nDFS today, and I'm all chilled for the hot day ahead of me. Boom!!!\n\nHave a great hump day folks!",

I love this place. My grandparents have rented the same condo here for like 40 years or something ridiculous, and when we found out they wouldn't be using their timeshare this year we snagged it. I've been traveling a bit too much, so I'll still be doing some work, but I'll be making time for fishing, hiking, walking around town, and, of course, Yellowstone.\n\nTaum Sauk for today's shave. Really great stuff. I'm starting to appreciate the difference in the scent in the soap more. I think it's the missing menthol and scent from the Icarus base shining through, but it feels a bit sweeter to me. I definitely get the juniper though. This is one of my favorite sets.",

The menthol in Fern Concerto is making my eyes water at the moment, which it didn't do prior to allergy season. I don't mind some eye watering with aftershave (eg Taum Sauk) because I no longer need to be able to see what I'm doing but during the shave it's more of a problem. I still love the scent of Fern Concerto though, and its green notes transition into vetiver nicely.",

Of all the scents I've tried from Shawn, Lamplight Penance is still my favorite. It's a dream of mine to get the splash for this soap. Unfortunately, this was the last of my frag sample. It's definitely one of the longer lasting frags I've ever used. I can still smell it a good 6-8 hours after just 2 sprays. I like that shit.\n\nI was liberal with the Icy Stare today. And I did the thing like yer sposed to do with the toner. I splashed the Icy Stare and then immediately hit it with some of that toner and it went on so much better than the first time I used it. I think I *get* this toner now and why they are so popular. 15 mins or so after the toner, driving to work, I was still getting the synthetic cool from the SBS and my just felt amazing after the toner.\n\nFucking awesome shit today. Fuck yeah. *That* is why I do this whole wetshaving thing. Because it makes me feel like *that.*\n\n*Hot For Teacher.* My 8th grade Spanish teacher was probably the birth of the whole teacher/student fantasy for me. I had never *wanted* to be asked to stay after school until that year.\n\nBut anyways. Happy Thursday, folks.",

I still don't know how I feel about Orbit, I was so hyped for this I expected a phenomenal scent, but its merely very good. The soap base performs great and the scent is non-offensive and a nice clean scent. I'd probably buy a tub eventually but I'm not rushing out to buy it like I thought would be.\n\nThe shave itself was great, no fuss.",

About a year ago I gave him this aftershave cream as a last hope. It is honeybee propolis based (as well as other natural goodies) and it did wonders for him. Last week we got our families together to let the kids run amok in their new home and he gifted me with some more of this wonderful aftershave cream.\n\nThe scent is hard to describe and their website doesn't help, calling it \"Black Tie Evening scent - a musky men's cologne fragrance.\" It is a slightly musky cologne fragrance, but the honey scent shows through for a while (which isn't a bad thing for me). I can't really nail down any other scents in this one, but they offer several other scents which are more clearly identifiable (my other favorite being lemongrass moonshine).\n\nDuring warm weather this stuff has to be used very sparingly otherwise you glisten in the sun and smell like sweet beeswax all day. It is an amazing post shave product and I had forgotten how much I liked it. Gonna save what is left for the colder months.\n\nHappy Thursday!",

Accordingly I am digging out Piacenza after a quarter-year banishment to my box of samples. I wasn't much of a lavender fan when I started out with teh soapz & smellz so I had a hard time getting along with it, but I don't mind it as much anymore. The orange and lemon in it are so vibrant and exciting, but that lavender / rosemary kick took some getting used to (as did the lingering amber / lavender / musk post-shave). I always think this stuff smells a lot like walking into Spencer's Gifts at the mall and smelling the incense display and air fresheners that they sell to help teens hide their weed stank. I shall forever associate this smell with Spencers instead of Parma.\n\nToday's perfume is Hugo Reversed by Hugo Boss. Grapefruit, bergamot, rosemary, and vetiver. An appropriate match for the Piacenza, sì? I got a sample of this in a gift set that came with a certificate for a full bottle of your favorite fragrance from the set. Normally I wouldn't have tried it but I figure I better give it a chance in case it pleasantly surprises me and out-awesomes the other 9 options in the set. (Pretty sure it won't but I'm still gonna try it out.)",

I allowed the thoughts and opinions of some to cloud my mind and judgement and cause me to neglect and then to sell off my Night Music set when I was still a fledgeling wet shaver. As my nose (nasal pallet?) has matured, I've been able to appreciate scents differently than before. In that line of thinking, I originally disliked Night Music, at least I think I did. Maybe. I dunno. I remember reading a review somewhere that labeled it as \"cheap stripper queef\" and that phrase stuck in my mind so badly that I just couldn't use the set and sold it or traded it off. Honestly can't remember now. Anyway, I regretted that decision enough to jump on the set when I saw it go up on FB. Damn. I was dumb. I really do appreciate the muskiness that's supported by the vanilla and strawberry. I'm not too sure on the bergamot or the iris in there, but that's ok. It's still REALLY good and I hate that I've spent this time apart. The only thing that I had that could possibly play nice was Biblio, seeing as how they both contain vanilla. It works well enough, but I wish I had the EdT to match instead. Hopefully Will releases this again in Excelsior because I know I'd be in for at least one full set. So moral of the story here is don't let anyone tell you that your cheap stripper queefs don't smell glorious. Because they do and I love them and they make me happy mom so quit trying to tell me how to live my life! Or something like that at least.",

Syrupy-thick and rich. Maybe to much for some. I will revisit for sure and try it out again.\n\nI definitely get the passion fruit and citrus/ylang ylang.\n\nScent Strength: x/10, X present during shaving.\n\nLather: I really needed more load time with this one. But I made it work. Just enough lather, though it was a bit thin.\n\nFrom some research I did, it seems that this base of soap is fairly unique. This was a version similar to Reserve, that lead to Reserve.\n\n*30 second load with lightly-wet, soft boar brush\n* 1.75 tsp water to build the lather\n* = 3 passes of lather.\n\nBowl - I used the XL version of this 3D-printable bowl:\nhttps://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3392930\n\n#### ❧ Brush Notes\n*^(Semogue - 2000 Boar‹16 uses›)*\n\nAs always, this brush is a favorite boar. Soft, but with enough backbone to keep the tips on my face where they belong (well, at least with the o-rings).\n\n----\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Just a little tugging\n*Neck*: Just a little tugging\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Very Close Shave\n*Neck*: Few hairs are showing some tip length (with most being cut flush)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm) *and also in the sub's sidebar.*\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

The 6S is a heavy razor - wow. Can't believe I thought this was fine. That being said, it's a very, very nice razor that glides smoothly. I found the R5 plate wasn't as efficient as the C-Plate on the Karve. I find my shave was not as close either so maybe it's time for R6. The bulky 6S head is not ideal for the areas under the nose.\n\nMayflower smelled much better to me this time around. It didn't smell as powdery as the first time I tried it and the AS is really, really good. I think DG AS is one of the best out there. I think there's a hint of menthol in this one but I can't be sure. Skin felt great after the shave.\n\nIt seems I'm on a dec train right now - I'm finding each shave batter as I'm getting the hang of lathering this one up nicely.\n\nHappy Friday eve!",

It took awhile to get her back to sleep which threw off my morning routine. I almost thought about skipping today's shave since I was behind schedule but decided to grab a synthetic brush and squeeze in a quick one pass shave instead.\n\nI already had the toner and picked up the matching balm off of the PIF table at the Maggard meetup. The packaging on the balm looks really cool and I like how you can lock the top to avoid accidentally using the balm. Thanks to whoever left it on the table.\n\nI ended up using a bit of the balm after the toner dried down. This was definitely overkill for a quick one pass shave but it left my face feeling amazing.",

I busted out my sample of Terror and newly acquired bottle of Icy Stare for this one. I'm not really big on menthol in soaps, but I was curious as hell to try this anyway. The scent is nothing to write home about, but I don't think scent was the aim here. If you like a cold shave, Terror delivers in spades. It was definitely a cool experience, but after this sample is gone I don't think I'll be buying a full tub. In aftershave however, I love the cooling feeling to finish off a great shave and again, Icy Stare delivers that in spades as well. The cold feeling lasts for over an hour which is obviously great when you walk out the door in the morning and it's already 80+ degrees. The performance of the AS itself is nothing to sneeze at either. It was my first use of a Summer Break post shave and I'm digging it all the way around. I finished out my shave with Chatillon Lux's new side project fragrance, Gloria. I'm a fan of floral scents and this one does not disappoint. It has added sweetness from the blueberry and vanilla that the honeysuckle just ties together beautifully. Shawn is at the top of his game right now. I wouldn't hesitate to buy any of his current or upcoming releases if you are into quality unique fragrances.",

The angle of attack, when done right, can be used daily if you're a blade feel person. and I can see how some people swear by this thing for its efficiency. The razors head shape helps you find the angle but it takes a shave or two to get used. Blade feel akin to the R41.\n\nI like the Shire scent it's very green, but it's not a favorite of my wife's. The splash is a bit different from the soap scent - which is by design.\n\nI wasn't able to get a brush from the mammoth drops, but I did get this hybrid which I think really captures the theme and the colors! The Maggard SHD is extremely impressive (a few uses in now). If a beginner wants a lower cost badger that performs like an expensive hand tied brush, this is the one I'd recommend. Absolutely awesome setting of the knot by JR Reyes from Instagram. Brush splays when I want it and displays the characteristics I want! Highly recommend. The Rob Fanchurian is really good for that too. Turn N Shave's Tip Knot is a half notch below those.\n\nB8 and B7 on the way. Thinking of doing a big brush comparison since my BAD is bad. Let me know if people would like that!",

It's a great base, and I felt like the violet and tobacco were slightly more balanced on the soap side this time. The AS still brings the tobacco in spades. The new brush actually looks pretty appropriate for Shire, with it's green resin and wood.\n\nI'm travelling with my wife and daughter up to the Lake District for the next few days to visit my wife's family. The most important preparations are done - I've packed a minimal set of samples and taken a set of photos of them in advance.",

Just seemed REALLY sweet and I mean 12 year old girl perfume sweet. But I hadn't tried it yet, so fuck first impressions. I HAD to use it today, even though today was back in the rotation of working on Electric Sheep. So I skipped the ES aftershave and substituted it with Cryogen since I already mixed the Cryogen soap with the ES. Why not keep the menthol train runnin? I just finished it off with a couple of sprays of Gloria and I'll say that I'll be keeping this EdP for myself instead of passing it along somewhere. Definitely sweet, but not cloyingly so and it doesn't remind me of a childish feminine perfume on the skin if that makes sense. I'm eager to see how it opens up as the day progresses but it's here to stay with me.",

There are a few more citrus bombs coming but they're all paired with either an aquatic or fern base so I grouped them into those categories instead.\n\nPiacenza, like most Stirling soaps, earns itself a SpongeScore of 7/10. There's nothing odd or confusing about lathering it. You can go fast and get quick results. You can go slow and get luxurious results. I still often need a balm instead of a splash in the winter, but it's A-OK with whatever I want in the summer. Scent quality on this one is good and so is the strength: neither weak nor overbearing. Solid performer.\n\nToday's perfume is Light Blue, another perfume that seems like a fitting match for Piacenza. I tried it back in the spring without being impressed, but once again it's an option on my gift voucher so I need to give it a fair chance in good summer weather. Grapefruit, bergamot, mandarin, and juniper up top; pepper, rosemary, and rosewood in the heart; incense, musk, and oakmoss in the base. I seem to remember it having a zippy citrus opening and then an annoying pepper-perfume heart. Guess we'll see. I'll sum things up tomorrow with a Citrus Roundup.",

This soap can definitely be used year round and I'll probably be buying a backup soon just in case it ever goes away forever. Wasn't sure what splash to use for it, thought a sweet tobacco might be best but all my stuff is still scattered at the moment. I hadn't used Torchwood yet so I grabbed that. Might have been a bit of a mistake, the leather in it was the last thing I wanted to smell first thing on a hot summer morning. Having taken the scent darker, I grabbed something on that end of the spectrum but that might still lighten it up a bit. I know Admiral has all that hotness right now (and it should, you should all buy it day one because you don't want that FOMO on this one), but I cannot wait for the release of Weinstrasse. It's such a great green scent that I know I'm going to enjoy as it transforms throughout the day.\n\nTGIF boys! Have a good one.",

This base lags a bit and I'm sure the new PAA base is better but I still got a great shave.\n\nMy continued impression of the SLOC is that despite its terrifying appearance it is very very mild shaver. I still got a great 3 pass shave today but if I missed the angle it was just pushing around lather.\n\nChatty Lux CdL is quite floral. Its a long laster too and currently about 1.5 hrs after my shave I can still catch wafts of it periodically.",

It's like a lemon drop fell in the grass and got the 5-second rule. As before, nice lather and good slickness but no residual. Good face feel after, but not quite as good as the Brown Bess was.

Still pretty smooth overall but a little bit of burn on my lower adams apple area- 1st pass against the grain so thats on me. Decided to try a face lather today rather than in the tin and it was different, I can see why some people prefer it. Seemed to stand up the stubble a bit more and allow for a quicker pass.\n\nReally liking Arkadias scent, getting alot of ceder but not overpowering. And the slickness was unreal but I guess thats kinda known with Stirling soaps around here. Being the knockoff king I am I went with Ventana (Sauvage clone) but was real light on the trigger, working in retail I don't really want a cloud following me all day.",

I love the bright, lemony scent on this one. It 's a great \"wake the eff up\" smell. Everything went smoothly with the Karve and Bic. My hands were a little slick from applying the balm, so I had some difficulty using the little sample spray bottle of Admiral. I'm only a couple minutes into my first experience with Admiral, but the opening reminds me somewhat of Lamplight Penance with its smokiness, but it's a different kind of smoky. Where LP was \"smoke in a confined space\", Admiral is more \"smoke out in the open\" if that makes any sense. This is a smoke that's not going to overwhelm you because it's got places to go. Just behind the smoke, I'm getting a powdery, slightly sweet, slightly citric aroma. I can't wait to see how this develops over the day (especially as the powerful lemon from the balm fades). Anyway, I think I'm starting to see why u/nameisjoey is so amped up about this frag.\n\nAlso, we apparently had a magnitude 4.3 earthquake last night up here in the Seattle area. I can't say I felt anything, but it appears to have knocked over my tiny sample bottle of Fougere Gothique. We will rebuild!",

Also trying the Ranger Tech with the old Nacet.\n\n#### ❧ Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Gillette - Ranger Tech ::: Gillette - Nacet ‹162 uses›)*\n\nThis Ranger Tech seemed to have similar safety bar geometry to my Sheraton visually, and it turned out during the shave to feel pretty much the same as well. A good shave.\n\nTook 4 passes to do the job, but got there. Maybe I've reached a new plateau regarding the Nacet's usefullness.\n\n#### ❧ Soap Notes\n*^(Mystic Water Soap - Sweet Briar - Pipe Tobacco)*\n\nBoy, this was a real winner! While MWS always performs well, sometimes the scent is just not strong enough for me to enjoy during the shave. This was was a welcome change, for sure. I loved the fact that it was sweet (for tobacco), and not too heavy.\n\nScent: a sweet, smooth, pipe tobacco scent with a touch of vanilla (that blends so well that you might just miss it).\n\nScent Strength: 4-5/10, light, but nicely present during shaving. It was enough to appreciate and enjoy.\n\nLather: Great performance as usual from MWS. This was a super slick, well-hydrated mix. Great glide with the razor and excellent protection.\n\n*Tub Load (Today's)*\n\n* 30 sec load with dense badger brush\n* 3.5 tsp water to build the lather\n* = 6 passes of lather.\n\n\nBowl - I used the XL version of this 3D-printable bowl:\nhttps://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3392930\n\n#### ❧ Brush Notes\n*^(Declaration Grooming - B5 Carnavis and Richardson Rubberset 400 24mm‹6 uses›)*\n\nI have decided that I like the splay and action of this brush knot, but the handle, while beautiful, is just not a fit for my hands.\n\n----\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Few hairs are showing some tip length (with most being cut flush)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm) *and also in the sub's sidebar.*\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

A creamy, sweet, and subtle mix of amber, sandalwood, and cedar with a mellow citrus top, this is a great summer scent.\n\nPerformance wise, we are at maybe an 83 FAYS, weirdly a bit lower than the two mutton tallow Stirlings I've used recently. I am a tallow type agnostic, so doubt the fat of lambs is at all better than the fat of cows, but I will still keep an eye on this going forward - I have other Stirling beef tallows that I can try to compare with muttony PaP and Varen. Stirling remains a great bargain in wet shaving, and a good post shave evens out the FAYS score variances anyway, so no real issue, just a potential curiousity noted.\n\nThanks to Stirling for sponsoring the Games, and thanks to the judges and moderators for coordinating the event!\n\n**Post:** PSC remains a great post shave, even though their shaving cream is pretty mediocre. The formula in the after shave balm is a good one, and the moderate menthol amount elevates this to greatness. Also of note, the caffeine dose in here really does seem to reduce immediate post shave redness as promised.\n\n**Frag:** The perennial whipping boy of fragrance snobs, CW has recently underwent a pretty interesting change. As of maybe two years ago, the reformulated version is a lot less sharp than the vintage, and no longer resembles a screechier, cheap GIT. Instead, the new Cool Water is a much more mellow aquatic / citrus with a prominent musk and tobacco base, making it smell a bit sweeter and a lot more subtle. Perhaps they are trying to distance the scent from its all too common imitators made by Axe, etc?\n\nAnyway, the \"new\" CW strikes me as very wearable - the calone note is still prominent, so die hard aquatic haters will not be seeing the light here, but the citrus and woods notes are considerably better executed, and the scent in general seems more adult friendly.",

However, my wife is out of town this weekend and so it's time to break out the shave soup that she hates!\n\nIn other news, I feel I haven't been getting a good shave from this razor lately. This is very odd because I would say open to a couple of weeks ago, this was hands-down the best razor I've ever used. I tried switching out blades no avail. I'm not quite sure what's going on here, maybe this razor just works best for me in the winter? Something about my skin's condition in the colder and wetter months?",

I always grow out a vacation beard, so this shave was cleaning up the cheeks and neck... felt pretty good, and an excellent choice to travel with due to the temps in Southern California this month.\n\nHad a blast with the family checking out the Griffith Observatory last night, then getting some delicious and legit street tacos. Life is good, and getting better.",

I am figuring out that this brush needs loaded so much more than my synthetic and that loading it on the drier side helps.\n\nA good 3 pass BBS shave with a good scent combo.

This brush is awesome. The hair used is so soft, and the shape is a PERFECT bulb, and works perfectly with the hair. The material 'Krion', is a half natural, half manmade material. It stays a bit cool to the touch like natural stone and marble, but is more durable and stain resistant. I guess that means I can use this brush with Lavanille (JOKES!) =P Anyhow, I think these brushes were HIGHLY underrated when they were available, and very rarely spoken about at all. I'm just glad I was able to acquire one!\n\nDFS for me today! Hell yeah!!!\n\nHope everyone had a nice weekend ahead of them!",

Really nice lime/coconut that's not overly sweet, although it's sweet. Pairing with Sweet Lemon was awesome too, as the coconut note compliments the soap perfectly. Happy Saturday to you all.",

This Mannish Boy is a wonderful scent, though a bit light.\n\n#### ❧ Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Gillette - Ranger Tech ::: Gillette - Nacet ‹163 uses›)*\n\nGood shave. 4.5 passes today, because I was trying to do less buffing. The Ranger Tech seems to be a bit less efficient than the Sheraton. We'll see tomorrow.\n\nNo tugging or irritation.\n\n#### ❧ Soap Notes\n*^(Bufflehead - Mannish Boy)*\n\nThem: \"presents fresh with ginger, rosemary, and peppermint. The bloom is darkened with anise, cedarwood, and mahogany\"\n\nI dislike rosemary, peppermint, and anise very much. Yet here they are part of a wonderful blend that is interesting, a little zesty, a little woody, with a very enjoyable outdoors feel.\n\nThe only problem is that I wish I could have enjoyed it in more strength.\n\nScent Strength: 3-4/10; very light during shave\n\nBowl - I used the XL version of this bowl:\nhttps://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3392930\n\n#### ❧ Brush Notes\n*^(Semogue - 1800 Boar‹16 uses›)*\n\nAn inexpensive brush that would be great for someone wanting softness, low-density and backbone, with excellent flow-through, and no scritch or scrub. I can't wait for these tips to split all the way.\n\n----\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Few hairs are showing some tip length (with most being cut flush)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm) *and also in the sub's sidebar.*\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

Fantastic.\n\nWholly Kaw never disappoints, it's in my top bases.\n\nThis unreleased skin oil from Oleo is magical. I've been using it on and off for over a month, and it makes a huge difference when I do use it. I usually apply a few drops to a wet face right before bed. Awesome, especially when sleeping in the air conditioner can dry me out quite a bit. A little goes a long way, and it absorbs really easily. It's unscented, which I appreciate, as it won't interfere with it your fragrance during the day or scent your pillow at night. It does have a nice earthy very natural scent from the ingredients which I enjoy.\n\nThe PILS razor is really unique, a two-piece razor with a long smooth handle and relatively heavy head. It looks and feels like Thor's hammer. The shave is intuitive and enjoyable, no blade feel but efficient. This razor surprised me, as I thought it'd feel slippery in hand and unbalanced. But I had no issues holding the razor, and I allowed the weight of the head to determine the pressure as it glided across my skin.\n\nHope you have a great day all.",

      "body": "**2019-07-13 SOTD: Magical Perfumery Tour - Aquatic Onslaught 1/11**\n\n**Razor:** Fatip Piccolo SE (Gentile)\n\n**Blade:** Gillette Silver Blue (shave #3)\n\n**Brush:** ShaveHQ 24mm tuxedo Synthetic\n\n**Lather:** Stirling Dunshire\n\n**Post:** Skin Bracer By Mennen\n\n**Fragrance:** [Acqua di Gio di Giorgio Armani](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Giorgio-Armani/Acqua-di-Gio-410.html)\n\n**Thoughts:**\n\nAhhh, George's Water! (His toilet water, to be specific.) I read somewhere that it's one of the best selling male fragrances of all time and I believe it, because when we say \"AdG smells like laundry\" today, what we really mean is, \"modern laundry soap was influenced by the success of AdG.\" It's supposed to have a big citrus opening (awesome) with a sweet white-floral heart (cool, cool, cool-cool-cool) and a woody, musky drydown (awright awright awright) but every time I wear the stuff all I smells is fuckin' dryer sheets, dudes. That's a big part of the reason I refused to classify this one as one of the citrus scents I tested this week (but I grudgingly placed it right beside them in testing sequence, hoping its citrus essence would finally appear on this wearing). Maybe I'll get lucky this time and my nose will CLICK like it did for Explorer and it'll smell right proper.\n\nDunshire, on the other hand, opens with lovely citrus & peach (awesome) mixed with salty sea air (how? how did Rod do this? is this the magic of calone?) and sweet jasmine. It's a little *too* sweet for me when I use the matching aftershave but the soap on its own is very nice. I imagine it would even eventually arrive at a musky, woody drydown if I owned the EdT. *It's pretty much exactly what I wish AdG smelled like.*\n\nFingers crossed that AdG makes me happy today with its calone / hedione heavy formula.\n\n*****\n\n**Citrusy Scents Roundup**\n\nI compared four non-aquatic / lavender-free citrus-centric fragrances this week. All four were mild and largely inoffensive. Most of them projected until about lunch time and survived as a skin scent well into the evening. They're all good enough that I'd wear them if they were gifted to me, but I'm not sure that I'd spend my own money on the D&G (not a fan of the first two hours) or the Hugo Boss (poor performance, nice scent). Arranged from sour to tart to sweet they would go like this:\n\n[**Light Blue pour Homme**](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Dolce-Gabbana/Light-Blue-pour-Homme-1068.html) has a somewhat sour / bitter opening that's heavy on bitter yellow grapefruit (not the sweet pink stuff) and dirty bergamot. The heart is a sort of spicy-aromatic rosemary / black pepper deal with lingering hints of grapefruit. Once it hits the drydown it smooths out considerably and picks up a mellow floral / aquatic vibe which I suppose comes from the musk, oakmoss, and secret ingredients that never get listed in the scent notes. I liked the drydown but not so much the opening.\n\n[**OGUH**](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Hugo-Boss/Hugo-Reversed-52953.html) has a grapefruit & bergamot opening again, but this one is more clean, zippy, and zesty. Brighter and fresher. That lasted a while and then slowly transformed into a mild vetiver drydown mixed with little bit of rosemary to make it more interesting. It was pleasant and charming from start to finish but had the weakest projection and longevity of everything I tried, requiring that I bury my face in my arm within an hour of applying if I wanted to know what was going on. Pity.\n\n[**L'Homme Lacoste**](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Lacoste-Fragrances/L-Homme-Lacoste-46027.html) comes crashing out of the bottle with sweet orange, mandarin orange, and sour rhubarb. Hooo-weee! That gradually transforms into a heart that is strongly dominated by a fresh-grated astringent & spicy ginger scent with a few sweet hints of vanilla and almond. It eventually settles down to a woody base. The neat thing is that the tartness from the rhubarb never entirely fades away (though the rhubarby-ness does disappear after a while) and the edge from the ginger lasts well into the drydown as well. Fairly well constructed but you better like ginger if you're going to wear it.\n\n[**L'Homme Ideal Cologne**](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Guerlain/L-Homme-Ideal-Cologne-30620.html) is a light and sweet cologne flanker to Guerlain's original L'Homme Ideal EdT. The opening is a mixture of juicy orange, fresh zesty bergamot (not the usual bitter, spicy sort), sweet-ish pink-ish grapefruit, and a hint of pink pepper with its spicy-rosy scent. After that I sort of spaced out for a while (and I didn't apply it thick enough) so I sort of missed out on the almond / neroli heart, but I remember it being a little sweet and creamy. When I remembered to check again it had a gentle \"grassy vetiver and fresh laundry\" drydown going on from the neroli and musk. I need to try this one again and lay it on a little heavier in one spot instead of spreading it too thin down the entire length of my arm.",

The scent is fabulous and natural, so it has that going for it. What impressed me most was how fast it whipped up into a perfect looking luxurious lather.\n\nIt's light, unlike pretty much every artisan soap I've been using lately, but it's got a volume and sheen to it that I found very enjoyable to use.\n\nThe slickness and protection are solid. It falls a little bit when it comes to residual slickness, but I had no problems going over the same are more than once. It just wasn't as residually slick as other soaps. It doesn't help that I'm coming off using Excelsior yesterday, which is my favorite and slickest base.\n\n**Rex**\n\nI like this razor but maybe not enough to purchase. Three setting felt a little Blade but not super efficient. Maybe 4 will be my jam.\n\nWill see tomorrow.\n\n**Tip knot**\n\nIt's breaking in very nicely and has a very nice face feel.",

Yes, Excelsior takes a little while to get dialed in but once there it is fantastic. Post-shave is okay but the deltus AS makes up for it.\n\nThe picture is an old one but I used the 6S today and it's just as good as I remember it. Different to the Karve in some aspects but still great. I should have switched to the R6 plate to give it a try - need to remember that for next time. I think I'll be holding on these two great razors and switch between them. I'm still crazy about this Nacet!\n\nHave a great Sat all!",

It's one of my wife's favorites and is a scent memory for her that she links to our trip to Hawaii last October, where I used this for 8 straight days. Before a late afternoon shower/shave, I used a few sprays of Tommy Bahama *Set Sail St. Bart's* prior to doing some yard work in the high heat of the day. I know some folks consider SSSB to be a cheapie version of *Virgin Island Water*, but I just don't see it. That's not to say I don't like it, but they just don't have a similar vibe to me. *Virgin Island Water* is drinking a $16 coconut rum drink at the hotel bar at the Four Seasons. *Set Sail St. Bart's* is drinking a house margarita at the local dive bar right on the water. Lime, salt, sea notes. That's all I get from it. Still, I picked it up at $19 for 100ml, so it's fun to spray it freely throughout the summer months. Happy Saturday shaves, all!",

Fewer varieties of citrus and floral notes. Incense and patchouli for a base instead of all that other hibber jibber from the original. Will I like it better too? I sure didn't think it was anything special when I tried it a few months ago but the EdT surprised me yesterday so maybe I'll get lucky today too.\n\nDunshire was lovely again (as usual). I feel like Dunshire, Stirling Blu, and Mountain Man shave soaps all share a similar fruity-citrus-aquatic essence (though the aftershaves and EdTs are distinctly different). If I had to pick my favorite of the three shave soaps I'd have a really tough time. Much like Piacenza last week, all three of them earn a SpongeScore of 7/10 and my review of their performance would be identical, so you can [read that here](https://old.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/cc83fl/friday_sotd_thread_jul_12_2019/etldbuw/) if you want very slightly more detail.",

Lux Admiral\n\nToday was the second wearing of Admiral. I really like the fragrance, but I think it's one of the more genre-defying colognes that I've smelled. The lemongrass and verbana notes give it a barbershop quality. There are aquatic notes as well. There are charcoal smoke and tonka notes that should classify this fragrance as oriental. It opens as a pretty dirty fragrance, but it dries down to a very clean/fresh scent. I think that Admiral will be really popular, but I anticipate a lot of confusion as people post very different initial impressions.",

I've had this blade forever it must have come in a sample pack, but i never see it mentioned so I never bothered with it...Til today. Turns out, Spank likes the 7am Hi Platinum PLUS. The PLUS is on tryablade, but not this one. Are they the same blade in a different package? Not a clue. What I do know is, this one wasn't bad at all. Am I going to rush out and buy 100 off one shave? Of course not, but assuming tomorrow goes well I would grab a bunch if I ever saw them on sale, and at some point i'll plick up the PLUS off tryablade.\n\nSummer Storm is definitely my fav petrichor type scent, but I haven't used it in a bit (thanks Lather Games, then new-stuff-buildup). Nice to get back to it today. Chiseled Face soap and splash never disappoints.",

Good news is I have a beard so there wasn't too much area to cover. Also I did not bleed, at all, none. Bad news, much irritation on the aftershave but the good news, again, is that declaration makes a fantastic after shave that negated all pain and have me feeling great.\n\nThe shave itself, while at first I felt like a virgin trying to insert his..... different analogy maybe, like a young samurai first time he picks up that Katana, very wobbly and not much confidence. But by the end, I was starting to get the hang of it. It was probably one of my closest shaves I've had and also one where I felt like I got away with a lot. Which is hard to believe when wielding a long piece of sharp metal.\n\nWill I be apart of the generation that saves the straight razor??? I doubt it but I think it's fun to do every once in awhile and a skill I would like to get better at going forward.",

Just awesome.\n\nHappy Sunday all!",

This brush has been a year in the making, though I've had the Boba Fett mini for about 35 years. Huge thanks to u/phteven_j for doing such an incredible job not only setting my childhood toy in a phandle, but also for doing such an incredible job color matching the cup to Boba's colors. Also, I'm really impressed with the B8 badger hair. The tips are incredibly soft, but the knot still has a fair amount of backbone. I think this is going to be a very popular batch.\n\nAnyway, great shave with Shore. And Shore pairs very well with Delor de Treget. My noggin is now BBS.\n\nI finished of with a bit of Gloria. I don't know that I'm really getting any blueberry scent. I'm mostly getting light floral and honeyed vanilla. It's definitely a sweet and flowery scent and I can see folks making the Hawnsimal Farm argument that all fragrances are unixex, but some are more unisex than others. Gloria may be slightly less unisex than some of u/hawns other frags. Still, it's a nice stink. :)",

Keep in mind, I've never used a shavette or the Razorine before so I was slightly nervous. I used it as such for the first two passes and it took me effing FOREVER because I don't have the muscle memory to look in the mirror and adjust my angle appropriately. I will say, once I got the angle, it was very comfortable and I think with practice I could get the hang of it. I switched and used it as a safety razor for the final pass and that helped me get the spots I missed.\n\n​\n\nMy other takeaway is that I still don't love aluminum razors BUT I think I liked it when using it as a shavette because it helped me ensure I didn't come in with a heavy hand. No cuts or weepers. I consider that a win.",

After the shave was over, I wanted to do it again.\n\nI used to think I needed aggressive razors to get a good shave, but now I've found mild razors with sharp blades are my favourite shaves. It might not be BBS every time, but as long as it's efficient without tearing up my skin, it's good enough for me.\n\n4 years into this hobby and I'm still learning new things and enjoying the experience. I can't believe I used to buy into that \"more blades = better shave\" nonsense! I'm grateful for the Reddit community teaching me so much over the last few years. :)\n\nHappy Sunday!",

It was overcast the whole time, and the water was a bit cold, but totally enjoyable. I brought my bodyboard but it wasn't worth paddling out for the tiny waves, so I body surfed instead. I caught plenty of waves and thoroughly enjoyed myself. Hell yeah!!!\n\nFor the extra growth from a skipped day, I brought in the B3 to handle brush duties. It looks like there's a small patch of hairs right in the middle that are finer than the rest. I've never noticed this before, and wondering if more of the brush will develop this. It has definitely softened up with use, so not sure what the future holds...it'll be a surprise =P\n\nDFS on a beautiful day! I'll take it!\n\nHappy shaving all!",

This is maybe my 3rd or 4th time using this set and I still haven't gotten used to the softness of the soap. As a result, I tend to overload it. Better to overload than underload though. I think I'll try to scoop and slather the soap on next time like I do with CB's luxury cream base. Have a great day, folks!",

Loaded the brush like it was a race to the bottom (following advice from u/spazztik88) and it worked like a charm. Now I just need to remember to do that every time and I'll be good to go.\n\nI got a little more feedback from the splash today, but it's all good. I needed a good wake up this morning and I normally don't do 3-pass shaves two days in a row (my skin doesn't like that).\n\nNow I am just sipping my coffee and enjoying some peace and quiet until the kids wake up.\n\nHappy Monday!",

Also trying Irish Fern out for the first time.\n\n#### ❧ Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Gillette - Sheraton 1938 ::: Gillette - Nacet ‹164 uses›)*\n\nGood shave, though some focused attention had to be made to get my neck's trouble spots.\n\nNo tugging or irritation.\n\n#### ❧ Soap Notes\n*^(Wickham 1912 - Irish Fern)*\n\nThem: \"a classic Fougere, Irish Fern evokes images of rich greens, aromatic, herbal freshness, drops of falling water in deep woods and wind blowing over fields\"\n\nScent: I get the aromatic greens, herbs, and woods... but not really any water or wind.\n\nScent Strength: 6/10, very present during shaving, though it did build during the shave. Maybe even a bit too much... will have to use again to see.\n\nLather: slick and enjoyable. This is a little goes a long way soap!\n\n* 30 sec load in tub\n* lightly-wet, big, soft badger brush\n* 3.5 tsp water\n* = 5 passes of lather.\n\n\nBowl - I used the XL version of this bowl:\nhttps://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3392930\n\n#### ❧ Brush Notes\n*^(Stirling - Finest in CravingShaving Blue Slate 26mm‹10 uses›)*\n\nGlad to have this knot back in action. Had to re-glue it. Not too easy to splay, but didn't push me around too much. Wonderful soft tips.\n\n----\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Cut flush to where I just see the tips (above average for me)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm) *and also in the sub's sidebar.*\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

Great base, easy shave just so so scent. I find these clean barbershop smells fairly meh. I want to like them I really do but they always seem to be missing something.\n\nMy OC plate hasn't been getting much love recently so I decided to break it out for the week to give it a good rub around. I really like it, but I'm being a little bit more hesitant than I am with my SB. Hopefully that will change as I get more used to it.\n\nWeek off work this week so I'll be spending today putting garage shelves up. Thrilling! At least the day started off right with the shave.",

I had a sample early on and was just ok with it. Then, several months ago, my wife and I won a contest from one of those reviewers on IG who gave us (me) a shitton of samples (and two full bottles) from CL. I had an opportunity to revisit YRP and started to like it more. My daughter fell into complete love with it and it's become her thing that I just borrow sometimes. She also likes to \"shave\" with me some Saturdays and I surprised her with a set of YRP of her own instead of just the frag. She really enjoys the marshmallow-y goodness on her face. Her words, not mine. All in all, my face feels pretty damn great and I've really enjoyed the shave.",

It's heavy on the smoke and light on the rum to my nose (I think the two blend pretty well), aaand that's about all I could smell during the shave. I don't have the best luck with N.O. Sigh.\n\nInvictus is said to have hefty citrus, bay, and aquatic notes over a somewhat standard ambergris, oakmoss & patchouli base. Reviews of the stuff are mostly guys going \"why is this so poorly rated? it smells good - I don't understand the hate!\" I'm gonna be stuck in a car for most of the morning with my coworkers so I won't bother to put this stuff on until lunch time today for their sake; it is rumored to have, ahem, rather heavy projection. I'll post my thoughts on it later along with my thoughts on the Epsilon Blue.",

I started with the Switch yesterday because I knew my first use of a shavette style razor would take some time. And it did. But onto the Lupo today.\n\nI've never used a Wolfman and almost certainly never will so I'm starting with a clean slate instead of comparing the Lupo to its forefather. Just as I stated with the Switch yesterday, the aluminum makes this a very light razor if you are used to stainless steel and brass. So I made a conscious effort to make sure that I didn't add try to make up for its lack of heft unnecessary pressure.\n\nAnytime I try a new razor I always use a blade that I know is usually smooth out of the package. So I threw in a Wizamet Iridium Super and started. My first pass was crazy good. I saw others say they got a BBS with two passes and I think it's entirely possible. There's some blade feel but it's not excessive. Yet it was still as efficient as my Karve (if not slightly more so) and much more so than either RR Game Changer plate.\n\nI'll likely sell the Switch and lose some money. It's worth it for the experience. But I don't see a reason why I would part with the Lupo. $30 is just too damn good of a deal.\n\nLast thing: I love Tallow + Steel soaps but not the aftershave. It left a sticky mess on my face. I'll stick to hoarding their soaps only.\n\nHappy Monday, Peeps.\n\nEdit: autocorrect got me",

I've been chasing a closer shave on my chin as well as less irritation on my neck and was wondering if the taller cap of the adjustables as well as my tendency to use them more aggressively was factoring in. So - figured the tech was a good way to test that.\n\nSo far so good. Got a GREAT shave other than missing a few hairs under my nose (which is odd cause the tech is way more maneuverable under there). Was able to get much closer on my chin and have a lot less irritation on my neck. All in all definitely a step in the right direction. I'll probably go back and test the slim on a lower setting too to see how that does.\n\nOnly issue was how thin the tech handle is. Caused me some issues with my hands that I hope I can just work around. Otherwise I'll just get a fat handle tech and try it out.",

Then sometime a couple weeks ago I happened onto a rack of stainless steel mixing bowls at Wegman's, with the smallest one being $0.99. Perfect! The one I got even has a copper exterior so it's kind of decorative too! So I've been experimenting with that as a shave bowl and figuring out how to lather up the soaps I have. I definitely get a better lather when I do it right than I did with lathering from the tub, but it's been a bit of a pain figuring out the right soap/water mix to get that good lather. It's getting there though.\n\nAs for the East Egg soap, it's very much the quality you would expect from B&M as far as shave performance, so there's not much need to be said there. The scent, to me, is good but nothing great in that it didn't really give me that wow factor. It's a bit of leather and rich wood, very much in keeping with the opulence theme of the East Egg, it just doesn't smack me in the face and give me that great feeling. I love B&M's Seville in Reserve, Hallows, and Diamond scents, and East Egg is good just not in the same category for me.\n\nI've recently been tossing around the idea of doing a video review series on as many different soaps as I can get my hands on, just ordering a ton of samples and going through them and giving my reviews as I do. Not a new concept by any means, but could be a fun way to get more involved with the hobby as a whole. We'll see though.",

      "body": "Monday 7/15 SOTD\n\n· **Brush**: Declaration Jefferson B1 27mm\n\n· **Lather**: Wholly Kaw Fern Concerto w menthol, DM tallow base\n\n· **Razor**: ATT aluminum Calypso SE razor\n\n· **Blade**: Feather ProGuard AC (7)\n\n· **Post**: B&M Terror Deltus splash\n\n· **Frag**: B&M Fougere Aromatique EDT\n\n**Product Notes:**\n\n**Lather**: Mild to moderate menthol load turns out to work nicely, The slight cooling / numbing effect elevates the FAYS score for WK DM tallow from 90 in base configuration to 95 with the menthol. while the complex, sophisticated scent design of the fougere scent here also shines though. More heavily mentholated special editions tend to mess up the underlying scent, but WK hits a nice balance here.\n\n**Post:** I used Terror splash yesterday with Terror soap, and it was... a lot to handle! Using the splash on its own today is still intense. The splash feels a lot like windburn bordering on frostbite when first applied, as if one had been standing outside in 50 mph winds on a subzero day for a half hour. The numbing effect is pretty impressive, and is very perceptible even after using a mentholated soap.\n\nA lot of menthol post shaves experience \"fratricide\" in use, the phenomenon from nuclear war planning where a second missile fired at the same spot does not work properly due to the ongoing effects of the first missile's detonation. That is to say most menthol splashes and balms applied after a cold soap produce little to no added chill in my experience. Well, Terror don't play that way! I definitely felt the added splash effect both yesterday (after Terror soap) and today, with the WK lightly mentholated soap.\n\nThe Terror effect lasts for 2-3 hours, and it feels like one has cold spots radiating outwards from inside one's face. Even in 87 degree weather, you can still feel the cold deep down, even as you're sweating. Every different movement of the face - smile, frown, whatever - makes the cold surge a bit.\n\nEven hours after the 2-3 hrs of primary effect, some spots on my face still felt cold.\n\nScent of the splash is a bit less perceptible than in the Terror soap, so the main appeal here is the physical effect. As B&M says, be sure to have your face wet when you apply the splash so that you get maximal effect.\n\nAssuming you want that effect - Terror splash is a lot more intense than Krampert's Frostbite, and that splash was already a once in a while deal for me. Terror feels like it's rewriting my DNA, and the intensity is both thrilling and a bit off-putting. This splash, far more that Arctique, warrants the cautionary verbiage!\n\nCertainly on a hot day, the long-lasting cold twinges are welcome. but I think the soap might overall be more of a keeper for me, as the experience is both intense and short-lived. I'll try Terror soap by itself tomorrow and see how that works in terms of duration.\n\nStill, this is an amazing design, and I am thrilled to have the option available to play with. The scent (of the soap at least) is far more complex and interesting that Arctique, and the branding as always with B&M is impeccably well executed and attractive.\n\n**Razor / Blade:** Switched the AC blade over to a lighter aluminium ATT razor yesterday to avoid any risk of stains or rust in the steel Colonial head. The ATT shaves smoothly and efficiently, and is quicker to achieve BBS due to the light weight and maneuverability of the Calypso.\n\n**Frag:** Not sure how FA works as a summer scent - I think I like it! The lime, spices, and hay keep things lively enough so that the oakmoss, patchouli, and mushroom notes do not overwhelm the composition. Nicely balanced and a very pleasant complexity!",

I got back from a trip to Jackson Hole, Wyoming over the weekend so I had to go for the scents of the wild West.\n\nRoam is a fantastic scent that seems to smell different every time I use it. Sometimes I get a lot of sweetness, almost like a maple syrup type of smell. Today, it was earthy. The Thyme stood out to me today.\n\nThe BAM base is great. Great lather, great performance. I've liked using the Gillette 7 o'clock, but it isn't earth-shattering. It doesn't beat out Silver Blues or Polsivers for me.",

While TryThatSoap has it at a 3.51 for me, it didn't smell like that kinda scent you know? Wondering if it'll grow on me. WK performance as always is Top notch. but I overpowered the scent of the soap with my choice of a/s. Might have to go for a more neutral a/s while I figure out how much I like this scent.",

Glad I decided to commit to the full tub rather than a sample. The scent is just incredible! Great soap to use before moving in to a new apartment on a hot day. I'm ready to use a more aggressive razor at this point, and lo and behold, the Rockwell 6S that Ruds loaned me arrives at my door as I'm moving furniture upstairs! Can't wait to try it out in a few days. Thanks Ruds! Loving my wetshaving journey so far!",

Bell Ringer is a great soap with a nice smoothie like citrus, the heavy mango it interesting and not a scent I find often. The base is excellent too, that lather comes together so easily and is increasingly slick and protective.\n\nColbeck is also great, I wasn't sure what to expect but it's a slight citrus and bitter scent that I really like. My 3 year old on the other hand told me \"It smelly yucky, what have you been doing to smell so yucky?\".\n\nThe OC plate continues to impress, although the shave isn't as close as my other plate. Probably because the OC is an A plate and the SB a B plate. It is increasingly easy to shave with though and leaves me no irritation",

Turns out that this razor completely exceeds my expectations.\n\nI used the same blade as yesterday to try to make sure I had as much continuity as possible. There's not much more to say that I didn't yesterday. The lack of weight still feels very odd in my hand. But the razor just glides through each pass. It especially shines on the first pass with the grain, leaving me with a decent shave before going back across the grain.\n\nRegarding my soap for the day, I have been on the hunt for a good sweet coconut soap for a while and I just can't find the right fit. The description of Crystal Lake lead me to believe that this was going to be the one that finally checked the right boxes, giving me just the right amount of coconut and vanilla. I haven't been able to find it until I noticed that Italian barber had it on their site, so I threw in a tub when I bought the Lupo and the Switch.\n\nVerdict: it's just a bit blah. The scent is ok. But on the other hand at least it gave me a very slick shave and only slightly lacked in cushion. At least I smell good. Montrose Beach is an awesome summer scent and Island Man compliments it well.\n\nEdit: autocorrect",

Instead of using the full amount of either, I first used about half the normal amount of Electric Sheep aftershave. I waited until it dried then followed it up with about half a dollop of Roam aftershave. Once again, Roam killed Electric Sheep, so I just slapped the EdT on and called it a day. I still enjoy the scent of Roam, just wish I could find something else other than A City On Fire that mixes well with Electric Sheep. Oh well. The hunt shall continue Thursday I suppose.",

The B8 comes in at 26mm, while the B7 is 28mm. It might be the loft, but the B8 feels bigger. They are both equally as dense. Where I really start to see the difference is the backbone, and face feel. The B7 definitely has more backbone, and feels more fine, like B5, it's not gelly, but still soft. The B8 is soft, and has a bit of gel, but not to the extent that B6 does. I think if I had to choose one, right now, it would be the B8.\n\nHave a nice Tuesday!",

When I saw a box from Summer Break, I was pretty sure it had Cannonball in it, as that was at the very top of my wish list. What I didn't expect was a personalized soap and handwritten note. So naturally I had to use it right away. The scent is lovely, with the wood and pepper adding a nice level of depth and complexity to the sweet peach. It's fantastic. I'll give a more extended thank you on the Christmas mail call thread, but thank you rocket455, you're awesome!",

Also Loved and hated! Also sporty and fresh! Also citrus and bay leaf (and also maybe some more alleged bubblegum)! While some companies don't seem to know what a flanker should be (\"let's just capitalize on the brand name recognition of our old fragrance to sell this unrelated fragrance, guys\"), this one is *clearly* just a variation on the original. Lots of people describe it as \"tropical Invictus with amber instead of woods.\" Fair enough. Guess I'll see how it goes as the day wears on. I quite enjoyed the original Invictus yesterday but I think I prefer Azzaro Chrome.\n\nI'm in a hotel room this morning and knew I'd be in a rush to get out the door, so I didn't feel like hauling along a proper shave kit with all the bells and whistles because prep and cleanup take too long for me... I am the pokey little puppy incarnate. After making the move to traditional wetshaving I realized that most of my prior discomfort with shaving was due to poor technique and poor lubrication, not just to the equipment I was using. With that learning experience under my belt, I've been finding I'm able to wring much better performance out of my old gear than I ever thought possible. Was it as smooth and comfortable as a good soap lather and my Fatip? No. Did I come away post-shave without significant irritation and a BBS shave? Yes. It just wasn't as fun or luxurious as a proper wet-shave.\n\nI need to give this shave gel another chance with my Fatip so I can give it a SpongeScore. Tentatively I'm projecting it'll fall somewhere between 4-6... Likely a little on the lower side of that range.",

Was a joy to shave with, for sure. And trying a new soap to me, Velvet Ditch.\n\nGreat pairing, IMO, with the Whiskey Woods AS, too!\n\n#### ❧ Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Gillette - Aristocrat 1934 ::: Gillette - Nacet ‹165 uses›)*\n\nVery good shave. A little tugging on the first pass, but really very comfortable. good, close result, too! This guy handled the aging Nacet very well.\n\nNo irritation at all, even with no burn with the alcohol-based AS.\n\n#### ❧ Soap Notes\n*^(Bufflehead - Velvet Ditch)*\n\nThem: \"Southern inspired Chypre\" with notes of Magnolia, Pecan, Lemon, and Patchouli\n\nScent: The magnolia is very forward, but the other elements are there enough to even it out and keep it from being a feminine floral, IMO. The pecan, lemon, and patchouli were difficult to detect, and I probably couldn't have if I wasn't looking for them.\n\nScent Strength: 6-7/10, nicely present during shaving.\n\nLather: Lather was lighter and more airy than I like it. But adding more water was just going to make it worse. This one just mixed up drier than others from Bufflehead, and high-structure enough so that I need to remember to let it be that and not to keep adding water.\n\nMaybe try loading with a drier brush than usual, maybe keep some of the airy-ness out that way??\n\n* 30 sec load with lightly-wet dense badger brush\n* 3.5 tsp water added to make the lather\n* = 5 passes of lather.\n\n\nBowl - I used the XL version of this bowl:\nhttps://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3392930\n\n#### ❧ Brush Notes\n*^(Stirling - Finest in CravingShaving Blue Slate 26mm‹11 uses›)*\n\nEnjoyed this brush a bit more today, since it opened up just a little more. Going to keep it and i fully expect it to relax just a little more before settling down. I think it's going to be a wonderful addition to my brush lineup.\n\n----\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Just a little tugging\n*Neck*: Just a little tugging\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Cut flush to where I just see the tips (above average for me)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm) *and also in the sub's sidebar.*\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

For me, this is the one that started it all. It was the first full set I bought when I got into wetshaving. It's also the first fragrance I ever purchased. I love how bitter, sour and tart the fragrance starts and then how it ends with a touch of sweetness. Excellent, gentlemanly, long lasting citrus. Great shave all around.",

Thrilling, reasonably long, but not really a lifestyle choice that will transform your life into something new and strange. The feeling as Terror soap goes on is unique, like being stabbed with icicles in the face, but in a pleasant way, (well, kind of...) and then, unlike more typical menthol soaps, Terror remains chilling with each application of lather and so throughout the whole shave.\n\nPerformance is at least a 95 FAYS score, performing beyond the normal Excelsior level of 90. FAYS could even theoretically be higher - a 97 or even a perfect 100 - as I feel I could have my cheeks surgically removed after use and would not notice.\n\nSo on the one hand, that is a pretty comfy face, but on the other hand the chilling down / numbing effect may not be pleasant to all, and elevating the FAYS due to a (very legitimate) design \"trick\" may not be the best policy. So I will stick with 95. Your face - whatever of it you can still feel - will definitely not be sore at the end of this shave.\n\n**Post:** Nice moisturizing effect, quickly absorbed. Of the usual menthol based cooling, there is none perceptible. Fratricide at work, a 250 lb conventional bomb being dropped into the fireball (iceball?) of a 1 Megaton detonation...\n\n**Frag:** Mint, coriander, and woods. Sweet and woodsy, with the mint giving a touch of sprightliness. A better summer scent than I would have guessed, and I love the domed bottle. I'm digging stuff out of the back of the scent closet this month, and this is the best rediscovery so far.",

More intense than Proraso green for sure. I am glad I have the sample but not interested in a full size tub of the soap. I wish B&M would release some unscented products but they have opted to not do this and it ends there for me. All in all, the shave was fine.

As you may have seen in my intro post yesterday. I'm fairly new to wetshaving, and of course that means I'm breaking a bunch of newbie rules and changing multiple things up at once.\n\nThis is my first time using a Declaration Grooming soap, and also my first time using a Voskhod blade. The shave went very well! I love the DG soap. It lathered quite well, and my skin feels great. I've had two really good shaves in a row, and I think I'm learning to control the blade angle, and correct quickly if I make a mistake.\nAfter every shave, I ask my 3 yr old daughter whether she likes how Daddy smells, and today she said yes.",

Yesterday was rather uninspiring, but a lot of that has to do with the scent I think. Straight citrus just doesn't do it for me. Today I used a synthetic brush and it yielded a much better lather. It's on the lighter side of whipped cream consistency but still very slick and provided a good shave. I just prefer a thicker, denser lather.\n\nAnd speaking of straight citrus, the perfect pairing was obviously either Fresca Intensa or 88 Chestnut Street. I opted for the APR since I just acquired a sample and haven't used it before. The two are very similar, but FI is more intense (duh) but not as sharp as 88. It has some sweeter notes and a slightly darker base to it I suspect due to the addition of patchouli, sandalwood, lavender, ambergris, and musk among a whole slew of other things. Quite enjoyable, but a little fleeting as citrus frags tend to be.",

It seems like a new and improved B7, although B7 really didn't need that much improving. Softness that I get from B7, but a touch more backbone like B6.\n\nAs some on IRC know, I was hemming and hawing for a couple weeks about buying the S1 after using the Maggard slant. Just one shave, but so glad I did. I think the blade rigidity folks may be on to something...The slant gives me the rigidity that I do like from AC & GEM blades, but without the need to actually use those blades which are pretty regularly tuggy for me.\n\nSW Sandalwood/DG Original could be a desert island combo for me....Santal Auster and I have a love/hate relationship. Sometimes I love it, sometimes I feel like I smell like bourbon. Today i'm getting a bourbon vibe :(",

This is maybe my 3rd or 4th shave with the Wolfie and I'm continuously impressed with how efficient it is. I've got a fuckton of meetings today and about 5 docs that need to be written by end of day Thursday. Wish me luck!",

Perhaps I'll stick with it all week. Only change up was finally finishing out my two bars of /u/stirlingsoap's *Eucalyptus Mint* bath soap. Now I've moved on to two bars of *Satsuma* which should last through the rest of the summer. Might have to pick up a bar or two of *Red Delicious* for the autumn as that scent is going away. And perhaps some of this new mosquito repellent, while I'm at it.\n\nAnyway, shave was wonderful, as always. Happy Tuesday shaves, all!",

It is easy to get an amazing lather and the soap provides an excellent cushion and is perfectly slick. The face feel afterwards is probably the best out of the soaps that I currently own. I just love how it feels after the shave. There is no need for an aftershave. That said, that accompanying aftershave is one of my favorites. It does a great job and my face was nice and refreshed the rest of the day.\n\nScent: This has become my favorite scent. The smell of coal, and what I am assuming is coal tar really work in this soap. I don't find it \"dirty\" due to the bergamot and clove that really began to shine through during the lather / after the shave. It honestly smells warm, masculine, and fantastic to both me and my wife. It is truly a pleasure to shave with and has convinced me that I need to try out more SW soaps.\n\nWhile the soap was simply amazing, I probably should have grabbed a new blade. The derby premium was a bit dull and my shave was slightly less than perfect. I have only myself to blame for this one.\n\nIt was an important day for me so I grabbed one of my \"special\" soaps. I am glad I did. Overall an A-class shaving experiences.",

I was skeptical that it would perform much better than several budget options I had used and was happy with. In fact, the first few times I used it, I scooped it since I wasn't sure I would keep it. But after trying it a few times I am sold. I lathered directly on the puck today (I'm committed!). The performance is definitely a cut above my other soaps, and the scent is long-lasting and very pleasant. I even got an unsolicited compliment from the wife. She said it made her feel \"relaxed\" (she's 6.5 months pregnant, so that's a nice ancillary benefit). At first I assumed she was responding to the WCS splash that I paired with it, but after giving her both to sniff she said \"no, it's the soap...that's the one I'm smelling.\" And I think she's right, actually. It's a few hrs later and I still smell the soap on me, whereas the splash faded quickly. Now I guess I have to spring for the matching splash....you know, to keep the wife happy. Not cuz I'm addicted to this stuff.",

It's such a great shaver, so don't know why I don't use it more often. *shrug\n\nIt's amazing how a different handle changes so much about the feel of a razor. Not just how it feels in hand, but the actual shave itself. The balance changes, so the tactile feel does too. This Jurgen Hemple handle is a perfect match for this head. It's heavier than the one that comes in it, but what I like more is the feel. I just don't like smooth handles. This rectified that with the added bonus of looking sick and bonus weight. I'll take it!\n\nDFS with some Bufflehead and a single edge shave. BOH!!!!!\n\nHappy shaving everyone!",

Damn was that an enjoyable shave.\n\nI normally don't wear a fragrance to work, but the pt load is light tonight so I decided to test out EdT. I took u/hawns ' advice and just sprayed a bit on my neck downward before I put my scrubs on. I find myself getting random whiffs of the scent and it's fantastic! This might become a regular thing.

Maybe take a few undocumented shaves, who knows, but today is a nice milestone so how can I not post it? Had a nice shave even with two days growth, the lather a bit on the thin side. I have so many samples I want to kill but maybe I'll save those for September. I just have too much. Far too much, and I want to see some quick progress, hence today's choice. A sample taking up the space of a small tub, now residing in my lather bowl, where I won't scrape it back up to use again.\n\nLife is short, shave with good gear.",

Got a little better on some of the angles on my chin. Also experimented a bit with 2x WTG passes on some areas and happy with the way it's going. Did some blade buffing on my chin and that might also be the way to go. Neck is still *very* happy with the tech so for that alone I think I'm honing in on a less aggressive razor being my bag.\n\nAlso in only mildly related news I switched over to a new hair clay today. I've basically just used the Aveda stuff for years and wasn't ever really looking to switch until I caught all the chemicals, etc. in there. THEEEEN I found out that some soap makers make clays and so off I went on finding something. Settled on Firsthand Supply Co's clay and so far *very* happy with the results.\n\nHope the first half of y'alls week was fantastic but nothing compared to the half ahead.",

I wanted to be able to pass this up and go on about my life. That's fucked now! I really fuckin enjoyed it. Ugh. I messed up and read the scent notes a while back and was pretty unsure how I'd feel about the frankincense and peppermint combo but they work very well together. The synthetic menthol is a perfect addition. The only problem with that stuff was the sprayer bottle. I didn't think about it y'all, but don't spray several sprays at one time aimed at your hand while standing in a small bathroom. Don't do it. I breathed in a good bit of that stuff and it wasn't fun. I must've aerosolized it when I sprayed it so much so fast and I gassed myself like a dummy. It never burned my eyes, so that's still a cool thing. I blindly reached in my drawer and grabbed the Grey Vetiver today and I forgot how much I really like it!",

It was the summer of my college internship and every morning I would stop in at Caribou Coffee for a cup to take to work as I was crashing at a friend's parents for the job and I didn't have a way of making my own. For some reason this particular morning, I opted to order the recommended food pairing because I was hungrier than normal and it sounded good. So I ordered a cup of the breakfast blend and a lemon poppyseed muffin. I will never forget how those two played together. You take a bite of the muffin and get this savory sweet lemon bread cake taste, take a hit of the coffee and the lemon notes are accentuated, the bitterness of the coffee subdued; go back to the muffin and the lemony coffee notes and overall flavor just add so much to round out the sweet bready taste - this glorious cycle continues until they're gone. Well as I sit at my desk drinking my coffee and smelling the remnants of Sweet Lemon on my face, I'm reminded very vividly of this memory. I might have to do this more often....but without the Feather blade - no weepers or nicks because I'm an expert, but my goodness is it a scrapy bastard.",

The soap lathers similarly to DG's bison base - it's a *little* softer and tends to get stringy when loading. The lather is excellent - closer to elmers glue and doesn't have a lot of volume/airiness. The lather is very slick and performed very well with the 6S. The scent while lathering wasn't as strong.\n\nAlthough just a first shave, I thought the residual slickness was slightly lacking and the post-shave feel, while not dry, wasn't as moisturizing as others. I think I need a few more shaves before judging.\n\nR6 plate is working out excellent. It's very smooth while providing lots of blade exposure for some great efficiency.\n\nI'm pretty happy that I'm continuing to see an improvement in shaves.\n\nOh and Terror AS - well that an interesting experience. I'll save that for another SOTD.\n\nHappy hump day.",

Lux Gloria\n\nI'm really impressed with the last couple of releases from Chatillon Lux. Admiral and Gloria are both really interesting and wearable fragrances. As advertised, Gloria is quite sweet. However, it does definitely lean a bit masculine.\n\nOne problem that I've had with some of the Chatillon Lux fragrances is that they don't seem to last for very long on my skin. Gloria is not that way at all. This stuff is atomic. 2 sprays is going to be all that you'll need and it will last all day. I'd say the performance is quite comparable to Tobacco Vanille. Much like Jordan Binnington, this needs to become a permanent addition to the C. Lux starting lineup:)",

In the meantime, I filed a search request with the USPS and of course they replied after a week saying they absolutely could not find the package. That was about ten days before it appeared. Maybe this is some secret extra-dimensional experiment program like in \"Stranger Things\"?\n\nIn any case, wherever my East Egg was, it was quite warm. Looks like the soap was baked in the sun for... quite some time, as it is now dark brown in shade versus the off white that a non-sun dried version of the soap should look like.\n\nThe soap performed well, appearing to have lost none of its Excelsiorence despite it's extended sunbathing. The scent was perhaps a tad less prominent than in the other tub I own, but that could just have been due to just starting the tub. The scent usually develops a bit more after first use in my experience.\n\n**Razor / Blade:** Still a good shave, but the ProGuard is now delivering a somewhat less close shave than it did when new. The Schick Proline and regular Feather Pro seem to give a few more good shaves per blade, but the PG will still hit ten uses pretty easily, which, for me, exceeds most DE blades in lifespan.\n\n**Frag:** Believe the hype - one of the most unique scents of 2019, a smoky scent that succeeds in finely balancing the smoke note with other parts of the composition, and an aquatic that my aquatic-hating self finds charming and complex. I think this is going to be a hit for CL.",

I thought it smelled pleasant but not being into frags I didn't know at the time that it was a dupe of Viktor & Rolf's Spicebomb. Now I wish I would have jumped on either of Noble Otter's or Stirling's Kaboom's. I'm definitely going to check out the frag to see how close this resembles it.\n\nOleo's canard base performs great and leaves my skin feeling nourished. I like the incremental upgrade in the aftershave which now contains some skin food and feels much better than the previous alcohol and fragrance only formula.\n\nI'm still breaking in this knot but the tips already feel very soft and it has great backbone. I was initially thinking of going with a 26mm but chose to go with a 24mm due to the glue bump warning. The density is great and it feels much larger than a 24mm. I'm really happy with the knot so far.",

I just have so many great soaps to choose from, and I love using my brushes, so this brushless product just didn't have much appeal. But I finally decided to bite the bullet and get it done.\n\nIt was a good shave, but the post experience... say, 15 mins after... was lacking.\n\nI also wanted to see how this OC razor handled my old Nacet... and it did fine.\n\n#### ❧ Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Timeless - Stainless Steel .68 - Open Comb ::: Gillette - Nacet ‹166 uses›)*\n\nI was surprised at how nice the shave was. And the blade worked well in this razor. I'll try the same setup tomorrow, but with a normal soap.\n\nIt did take longer to rinse the razor, since the product was a bit oil/gel-like.\n\n#### ❧ Soap Notes\n*^(Trader Joe's Cream Shave - Honey Mango)*\n\nScent: I got a cocoa butter and mango vibe from it, though I can see the honey in there. Not bad.\n\nScent Strength: 6/10, present during shaving.\n\nLather: you don't make one with this stuff. Just a thin layer is all that is needed, apparently.\n\nFace feel was pretty good during the shave. I guess it protected me pretty well. Razor drug just a little compared to a conventional shaving soap, but it wasn't a big deal.\n\nDefinitely more rinsing involved in using this product over a conventional soap -- a lot more -- but it still saved time in the end, since I didn't need to make a lather.\n\n* About two almond's worth for the first pass.\n* Same for second.\n\n10 mins after the shave, I'm feeling a little dryness and itchiness. It looks like the penalty for not rinsing it all off is an itchy face. I whipped out some balm and put some more of that on to help with the feeling.\n\n----\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Just a little tugging\n*Neck*: Just a little tugging\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Very Close Shave\n*Neck*: Few hairs are showing some tip length (with most being cut flush)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm) *and also in the sub's sidebar.*\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

Posting SOTD very late for me.\n\nMountain Man. Citrus berry iced tea to my nose, basically.\n\nPart of working through all these perfume samples to find out which ones I like is to also compare them to things I already own and find out if the samples are good enough to spend money on when I might already have something similar. Invictus and Invictus Legend were both all right this week but my impression of them is that I prefer Nautica Voyage and Azzaro Chrome, so that's what I'll be wearing today and tomorrow to make sure I'm right.\n\nVoyage is sort of green-aquatic with a strong Apple Jolly Rancher vibe to my nose. It's a bit weak if you spread it out so I like to put about 2-3 sprays in one spot, which substantially improves the projection and longevity.",

Wow was it impressive! I have to say I wasn't expecting it to be this good. Thick, sliiiick, dense, creamy, protective are words that come to mind. It really checks all the boxes I'm looking to be checked. I don't evaluate post shave during the summer months because my face always feels pretty nice this time of year no matter what products I use. I will have to revisit during the winter when my skin is super dry to give an accurate assessment. The scent is great, really similar to BaM Tuesday. This will be my replacement for it when mine is gone (if that ever happens). If you like violet, than obviously you'll like this. If you don't, well I don't know what to tell you. Your nose is broken. For today's smellz I went with Taum Sauk that I just got in. First time using it and I'm really liking this so far. It's a really pleasant combo of evergreen scents with a vanillic dry down. This will be great any time of the year. Another winner from Chatillon Lux for the collection.",

The wide head is going to take some getting used to but I love how nimble and minimal it is. This is for sure the best razor ever if you just wanted to shave under your nose. Definitely need a few more uses and see how different blades feel but so far not as rough as I thought, we'll see if it can dethrone my beloved WR2...\n\nShout out to Ruds for letting me borrow this razor and shout out to Will for being the nicest and most generous guy ever and hooking me up with this soap!

I can see how others like it but this one just isn't for me sadly. B&M continues to have an elite base and as per norm, as I had a great shave from it. Also, I think I found out I like synthetic brushes more than badger. I went back to using my Simpson brush just for this shave and found it more difficult to get a good lather. I am sure I could get the same output from it (by taking my time) as with a synthetic, but I might keep my Simpson for \"special\" occasions and not my daily brush. Hope everyone has a great day!",

After lathering yesterday and letting the soap sit in a closed container, off the puck the scent is a spicy, musky woody smell with some cucumber/vegetal notes - it's a pretty deep and classy smell. On lathering, it brightens up a bit with fruitier/citrus notes, but only a little bit. I cannot figure out what these notes exactly are.\n\n\nCheers!",

I was able to get an irritation free shave, but only did two passes. My skin can be fairly sensitive and I wanted to avoid any issues this go around. Overall an okay shave.",

My beard doesn't grow that fast, and I find having the extra time to heal and grow results in a better shave with less irritation. This time, I shaved after about 36 hours.\n\nThis is my second shave with the DG Mayflower, using up the rest of the sample I had. It's an excellent soap. Still being new, I think I have not yet perfected my lathering technique, because my first pass felt a bit dry, despite making several water additions to the brush during face lathering and the lather having a nice sheen to it. Despite that, I had a pretty good shave. There were a couple of spots where I felt a little bit of tugging, and the slightest bit of razor burn. I think it's most likely attributable to beginner technique. But no weepers!",

It does so very well! I only feel a marginal step back from when I add a balm. I have decided I don't like the Treet blades, they aren't sharp enough for me. Too much painful tugging. The Merkur 33C is a mild razor, I might try out the Treet blades in a more aggressive one at some point. Probably not though.",

First off, a beautiful sandstone ebonite Washington B3 that I purchased. Some Washingtons have a shorter loft, which I didn't like, but this one splays wonderfully. Pictures don't do the handle justice. The scrubbier B3 knot felt good on three days of growth, still dense and soft but with plenty of backbone. I'm glad to add some variety to the softer Declaration knots that I usually use.\n\nThis was also my first ever shave with an injector SE razor. Many thanks to u/iamsms for this generous PIF! The G8 is mild, and it was very forgiving as I kept going back over trouble spots. Maybe not the best razor for more than 2 days growth, but I ended up with a close smooth shave and no irritation. The light weight feels odd to me, but I'm sure it'll feel more natural after some practice.\n\n[Here are some more pics.](http://imgur.com/a/IXNxvQ6)",

Used it first in my Rockwell 6C on Tuesday, then in my Karve OC yesterday and today in my Gillette Slim. It's legit the first time a blade hits a solid 10/10 on comfort/smoothness for me and still very efficient. Really impressed with these blades!",

I'm so excited to have this back and he did an amazing job repairing the brush.\n\n[Close up](https://i.imgur.com/RKk4ImS.jpg)\n\n[Wider shot](https://i.imgur.com/iFYbx2r.jpg)\n\nI think it looks awesome. He used some of the glitter that was used in the resin and combined it with the glue in the crack. He also coated the inside of the brush cup with glue before setting the knot back in the handle. There shouldn't be any issues with the brush going forward.\n\nAnyway, hope everyone has a wonderful day!",

Oh and speaking of ES, I've officially got a hole the size of a quarter in the middle of the puck! I'm pretty excited about that!

Fruity and juicy and fresh! Perfect for fruity aquatic perfume pairings.\n\nSkin Bracer. I'll admit it: I originally bought it for the lulz because I thought the scent was hilarious. Massive minty powder stank. I've been using it a lot lately though... Portioned out properly (2 pumps from the spray bottle I decanted it into), this has become perhaps my favorite splash for pairing with perfumes because the scent fades so quickly, unlike the rest of my collection. Skin Bracer is 90% gone in 30 minutes or less. Aqua Velva, Epsilon Blue, Clubman, and Gillette Cool Wave all stick around so long on my skin that I can still smell hints of them at bedtime some days, and they're so strong at the start that they desensitize my nose to certain notes and change my perception of my perfume. As far as functional ingredients go there's nothing but water, alcohol, and menthol in this one, so it leaves my skin feeling light and fresh for summer heat. Not much fun to put on after a bad shave though.\n\nChrome. The first time I tried the stuff I made the mistake of wearing something else on my other wrist at the same time. Pretty soon I couldn't tell which one was which, but I did know that one of them was projecting a beautiful haze of fragrance around me. Turned out to be Chrome. Some people describe it as smelling metallic and I don't get the connection at all. To me it's just a mix of sweet summer notes that don't smell like Any Real Thing when they're in perfect balance, but as the day wears on and the balance comes and goes I get brief glimpses of the constituent components - sometimes it's floral, sometimes citrusy, sometimes aquatic, sometimes clean laundry, sometimes a fresh summer breeze... At a quick sniff it reminds me of a lot of other fresh aquatics on the market, but upon prolonged wearing most of them feel very monotone to me. This one always seems like it has a little more character and subtle complexity than the rest. (Maybe there's a reason it has been on the market for nearly a quarter century now.)",

Also debated on doing **nothing** but samples until AA starts (Heeeeeeyyy - is Sample September a thing that should be?) and then just decided I was too tired to think so used same gear as yesterday.\n\nTech is doing really great on the underside of my chin still but I'm doing something with funny with the angles on the front part of my chin, below the corners of my mouth but close to the jaw line. Getting this two vertical lines left that nearly look intentional. I think I figured it out today though so am going to change up my angles tomorrow and see how it goes.\n\nNot worried about same soap/brush/razor all month - but not sure if I'm in the Nightmare teir or not yet. I have a few of the blades that others have driven for a month (or more) but just not sure yet. Leaning towards all in though ;)\n\nHappy Friday Eve y'all.",

I got the light mint and also a bit of coffee but not much else. It's a surprisingly light scent. It won't jolt you awake, instead I'd say this is a calming scent. Performance was top notch as always.\n\nI don't remember who gave me the heads up but thanks for the pro-tip about making sure I had water on my face when I used T+S splashes. It resulted in no sticky residue which was much appreciated.\n\nThese Merkur Super Platinum blades are really firm. I've had two smooth shaves in a row. I don't think there is a scenario in which it shows a worth of the .$60/blade price tag but thus far it's resulted in a few very good shaves.\n\nAnyone else suffering through 100+ degree heat topped with full body sweat inducing humidity? I hate this time of year.",

This might be my top razor, I'm absolutely in love with it. As a daily shaver it has the perfect level of smoothness while being very efficient. Eg, the efficiency of Karve D with the face feel of C. The efficiency of Rockwell on 6 while feeling like 4-5. The balance with this handle is also great for me.\n\nThis B8 is breaking in nicely, very soft on the face now, with great backbone (I don't tend to have a preference on backbone).\n\nWhat can I say, Excelsior is my top base. BaM 42 almost feels like it has a bit of Seville in it, great pairing. Waiting for Deltus Seville Splash...",

Previously, shavers would recommend soaps such as Espresso from the now defunct Reef Point, that are very nice but don't really smell like coffee. Coffee Spoons is a coffee-forward scent with a touch of tobacco imo.\n\n**RIMC** is an awesome fragrance with a not-so-awesome name. I wear it with Coffee Spoons because RIMC's drydown has a similar coffee and clean tobacco scent. The splash is much more apricot and jasmine forward. I wish B&M would put out more dedicated fragrances like this.",

The handle is wonderfully balanced, the knot very efficient, and the deckled (uneven length) composition of the fiber strands adds visual interest.\n\n**Lather**: One of our current greatest bases, in a unique and interesting scent that probably deserves a re-release.\n\n**Razor / Blade**: Somewhere between a DFS and BBS today, a sign that the ProGuard needs to be dismissed. The razor remains a pleasure to use; the ATT aluminum razors are really poster boys for the thrills of a light razor. Nimble, speedy, non-fatiguing.\n\n**Frag**: The only aquatic I ever liked before CL Admiral, Aqua (or \"Aqva\" if you will) is a dark, sinister kind of aquatic, much sharper than Admiral in its tops and mids, and a kind of mix of winter and summer scent elements. Like an underwater shipwreck site in the ocean, or the Bermuda Triangle in a bottle. Hits all the aquatic notes, but has a moodiness and complexity that those frags are normally missing.",

This shave was to test and see how the old Nacet would work with my OC Timeless .68, and it did great!\n\nAlso trying a new scent, Matterhorn. Loved it too.\n\n#### ❧ Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Timeless - Stainless Steel .68 - Open Comb ::: Gillette - Nacet ‹167 uses›)*\n\nBest shave with this blade in a week or two! Excellent combo. Normally, this baseplate is too aggressive for me, but with this smoothed blade, it shone!\n\nNo tugging or irritation.\n\n#### ❧ Soap Notes\n*^(WSP Formula T - Matterhorn)*\n\nThem: \"This fragrance was designed to take you to the Swiss Alps and the sparkling streams of water of the spring snow melt. Crisp and fresh, this is a fantastic fragrance. Inspired by Creed Silver Mountain Water.\"\n\nScent: I'm a big fan of SMW, so I loved this scent.\n\nScent Strength: 5/10, nicely present during shaving.\n\nLather: This Formula T base is really knocking on the door of the top-tier with its creaminess, slickness, and elasticity. Rinses were luxurious, and the lather was beautiful. Razor had plenty of glide and the shave was very close. I like the Rustic base okay, but this one is much better, IMO.\n\n+ 30 second load with lightly-wet badger brush\n+ 3 tsp water\n+ = 5 passes of lather.\n\nThis formulation was very creamy and luxurious. I wouldn't go thicker. So between 3-4 tsp water is the zone for me on this one.\n\nWith 2 extra passes, I might load for a bit less time next chance I get.\n\nBowl - I used the XL version of this bowl:\nhttps://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3392930\n\n#### ❧ Brush Notes\n*^(Stirling - Finest in CravingShaving Blue Slate 26mm‹12 uses›)*\n\nAs usual, tips are super soft, but backbone is medium to slightly higher. Does splay, but just a little.\n\n----\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Cut flush to where I just see the tips (above average for me)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm) *and also in the sub's sidebar.*\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

Well, the soap drawer is getting more cluttered so I've resolved to try and kill a couple tubs. This one is getting close, so I will work it into heavier rotation.

It's like a mud mask--my skin feels super soft afterwards.",

Getting better results each time. Still loving the post shave feeling of SBS lather. First time using an AS. I picked some up for cheap on the bazaar and enjoy the scent. My PIF win comes in tomorrow. My SS will arrive next week along with the Fresca Intensa soap. Looking forward to trying everything out.",

My prep wasn't great, but not the worst its ever been, but the shave was terrible. There was lots of tugging and a fair bit of irritation post shave. I'll give them another chance with better prep, but otherwise they might be destined for my wifes razor.\n\nFirst time using the Lavender Sublime sample in a while and it a great soap. Lavender and Lime are two of my favourite scents, so putting them together is perfect. They compliment each other very well, and it varies as to which one I smell more prominently. This is definitely a sample I'll be picking up a full tub of if I ever get the chance (although I haven't seen it for sale for a while).",

In other words I needed to Keep 'er Movin. If you haven't ever seen the Manitowoc Minute please check out the link up topside. I'm not from there but I worked for 7 years up in Wisconsin and so this is always a good way for me to get a dose of that good sense of humor up there.\n\nI went with two full passes and a clean-up on the chin, and limited my lathering to the areas on pass 2 that actually need it. Also hit some different angles on the front of my chin and got that little spot I've been chasing in pass 2 versus the cleanup. ALSO got my bottom of the chin trouble spot in the clean-up by trying a little j-hooking. Feeling like I'm getting it down though still feel like I'm going to screw it up and give myself a hearty slice. I think the techs mildness is helping me out there for sure.\n\nWent with TEXAUS beause it's Friday and I wanted a treat. I really really love this scent - for those that also like it do you have anything that comes close? To me APR Torchwood has some of the same woodsy notes but is missing on the citrusy side of things. In order for me to avoid becoming someone who either stockpiles this or forever chases tubs I'm starting early on finding what my \"next best thing\" is going to be when this one is gone.\n\nHappy day y'all.",

The hype train has been strong with this one. /u/MadDingersYo sent me a sample and with tomorrow being the 50th anniversary of the first moon landing, it's finally time to try it out for a couple days. I'm going to hold off on posting my thoughts on it until I've used it a few times because I want to be fair and not just post a knee-jerk reaction. That said, Skin Bracer seemed like a natural pairing for it today with its minty, powdery, chilly menthol freshness.\n\nToday's perfume turns a corner. The previous six aquatics were sort of fruity-floral concoctions built around aquatic cores. The next five mostly strike me more as fresh fougères with aquatic aspects; i.e., if you pulled the aquatic notes out and looked at what was left over, you would say \"that's probably a modern summer fougère.\"\n\nYSL's L'Homme Cologne Bleue is one of those \"this wasn't necessary\" flankers that seem to have been released purely to fill a hole in the designer's product line, the sort that elicits reviews like \"capably executived with no creativity.\" Citrus, lavender, geranium, patchouli, woods, and a few spices? Sounds like a modern oakmoss-free aromatic fougère to me, aside from its \"cold marine\" opening. As usual I'll post my impressions as the day goes on.\n\nAlso: fuck this blade, man. Three shaves, three days of nicks and weepers and mediocre face-feel. Sure, they were all BBS and efficient as fuck too, but it was no fun to shave with. Into the bin it goes.",

I really watched my prep and technique to make sure I wasn't causing the issue. It sucks because I love the scent. I'm thinking it might be the lime because I had a similar reaction to Stirling's Coconut Lime AS. You win some and you lose some I guess.\n\nHope everyone had a less burny start to their Friday.\n\nHappy Friday!",

I used the Glissant version this morning and had a fantastic shave. I really need to pick up the matching splash and EdT. I have the splash in the Reserve formula but only use it with the matching soap. I'll pick one up once it switches over to the Deltus formula.\n\nIn other news, I received my package from my secret santa yesterday and boy did they deliver. I received a Noble Otter NeV set and it smells as great as I remember. I'll post it over on the thread.\n\nWe're getting some really hot temps in the Midwest this weekend. To all in the area, please remember to keep cool, hydrated and check in on elderly loved ones.\n\nHappy Friday to all!",

After watching a recommended video on how to lather a brush, I attempted to follow the guys instructions and load my brush for 45-60 seconds. I ended up with a thick paste on the brush, and when I applied it to my face it was like spreading toothpaste out, or even thicker. Definitely not as intended. I added a lot of water, and sort of made it work, but it kept clogging up the razor so I had to do frequent rinses. That said, this was a very good shave. Only one time did I feel I had a bad blade angle and a little razor burn. I did get two small weepers on my upper lip from attempting to go ATG, but otherwise this was a great shave.\n\nToday's shave consisted of three passes, WTG, XTG, and then ATG. I even did ATG on the sensitive part of my neck and it so far seems to have gone well. We'll see if I still feel (or look) that way in the morning.\n\nI love the smell of Ghost Town Barber. It was the first \"real\" soap I ever got, gifted from a friend.",

Whipped Civet out of my bin of toTry soaps and I really enjoyed the musky scent.\n\nAnd the Tuscany balm actually worked with the musk after the shave. I've always thought of Tuscany as a wild cherry type of scent, but I guess that's just what the bergamot, violet, and spices add up to... at least to me.\n\n#### ❧ Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Timeless - Stainless Steel .68 - Open Comb ::: Gillette - Nacet ‹168 uses›)*\n\nGood shave. Chugging along. Love this Timeless with this old blade, especially.\n\n#### ❧ Soap Notes\n*^(Chiseled Face - Civet)*\n\nA Zoologist scent/collaboration.\n\nThem: \"opens with a spicy floral accord, threaded through with dark coffee tones. Slowly it prowls forward, unraveling base notes of leather, moss and vanilla that combines with distinctive civet musk to create a bewildering, sophisticated scent\"\n\nTop Notes: Bergamot, Black Pepper, Lemon, Orange, Spices, Tarragon\nHeart Notes: Carnation, Frangipani, Heliotrope, Hyacinth, Linden-blossom, Tuberose, Ylang\nBase Notes: Balsams, Civet, Coffee, Incense, Labdanum, Musks, Oakmoss, Resins, Russian Leather, Vanilla, Vetiver, Woods\n\nScent: It was light, so I didn't get much of this whole list of notes. Obviously got the musk, and maybe the Russian Leather.\n\nI'm glad this one was a bit lower in strength, so the punch of the musk could be appreciated instead of setting me on edge.\n\nScent Strength: 3-4/10, lightly present during shaving.\n\nLather: this lather was about as good as I could get it by the 3rd pass. Still had a little creaminess, but was serviceable. This lather is not going to get really creamy, so I need to run this one dryer than usual.\n\nWhat this maker lacks in performance, it gains in scent manliness and character.\n\n* 50 second load with lightly-wet dense badger brush\n* 3 tsp water to build the lather\n* = 6 passes of lather.\n\n\nNice, slick feel during rinses.\n\nBowl - I used the XL version of this 3D-printable bowl:\nhttps://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3392930\n\n#### ❧ Brush Notes\n*^(Stirling - Finest in CravingShaving Blue Slate 26mm‹13 uses›)*\n\nI'm liking this knot. Not as much as some, but they are more expensive. Will definitely continue to recommend it.\n\n----\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Few hairs are showing some tip length (with most being cut flush)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm) *and also in the sub's sidebar.*\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

It left me a little dry but that's not a big deal to me. It's a decent soap but I don't find it particularly exciting.\n\n\nI took my son out dirt bike riding with an old friend yesterday.

It was one of those shaved that you know you can push to BBS. I went 5 passes with no irritation. Really great shit.\n\nEDIT: Added frag.",

I thought the Platinum was as efficient as the GSB but smoother, and the CG L2 seems to be to be a pretty moderate razor, despite the reputation it has in some circles for aggression. The Torpedo handle is the finest 4 inch handle I've used, and looks amazing.\n\n**Lather / Post**: One of the best of the Reserve scents, Cool is moderate power in scent intensity and a great warm weather scent. If only all Reserve splashes had menthol in them!\n\n**Frag:** Sadly discontinued, the very high quality ingredients in this \"shopping mall brand\" fragrance were a best kept secret in perfuming for many years. A great realistic (and apparently authentic) sandalwood note that is spicy and crisp, the EDC's only real flaw is its short duration, about four hours or so. If this ever comes back, and if they maintain the same ingredient quality (two very big \"ifs\") this is worth a purchase.",

Imagine my shock when I realized it was Rockwell on the #6!! and not #5 as I initially thought it was :( am i getting so old that even #6 is no longer aggressive for me??? :o the wolfman standard gap felt just right and it's only been 2 days since I last shaved. Clearly I have to go looking for more aggressive wolfman. Or use the Timeless Bronze if I don't want to break my bank account.\n\nI'm an old, old man :(",

Shoutout to /u/jeffm54321 for hooking me up!\n\nThat lather was fantastic--dense, creamy, and super protective. The scent is really interesting. I like it, but I was expecting it to be more woodsy. It's almost kind of vegetal. I get a lot of grass, some florals, and eucalyptus. The notes have Pine, Cedar, and Birch, but they very much make up the background. It certainly smells good, though. I've never been to Alaska so I can't confirm the accuracy of the scent, but I could see Alaska smelling like this.\n\nSuper smooth shave today. Got about as close to BBS as I get!",

I haven't posted a photo or done a SOTD post since I wrapped up with the games. I finished up some commissioned work for an upcomming release, but after 30 days of pedal to the metal non stop content, I needed a breather. Thankfully, I'm getting back to the point where I feel like I have some equilibrium and I can get caught up on some outstanding responsibility.\n\n​\n\nOne of the best things that came from the games though, was really narrowing down my likes and dislikes. I got some perspective on the soaps that I really liked and others, that honestly I wasn't reaching for. With that, I sold a bunch of soap sets and in turn bought a few that I wish I had. I'm also clearing out my razors to only a few that I really love. During the games, I borrowed a Game Changer and fell in love with it. The .84 on the barbers pole is a really fantastic value.\n\n​\n\nFollowing the games I was also given the opportunity by a friend to check out some additional Declaration Grooming Batches. He loaned me a B2, B4 and a B5 and in exchange I shipped him my B1 and B8. I've been using the B2 almost exclusively this past week and I have been really impressed with the mix of softness, gel and overall performance.\n\n​\n\nSo what can I say about today's shave? I've used this exact setup for the past week and been 100% happy with the performance, scent and total experience. Its been nice to have something that's a mindless go to. The Stirling Set is somewhat of an unobtainum as it was a single run for South Florida Wet Shavers and is not in production. Its based on the Tom Ford Grey Vetiver fragrance. Its a citrus forward scent with an underline of Vetiver that has probably become my signature scent over the last six months, followed closely by Guerlain Vetiver. Its good and with its rarity, I'll probably check out Fine \"Fresh Vetiver\" in the future so I have something similar I can use.\n\n​\n\nI'm going to be doing a photo set of R4L along with the Dorian Brush in the next day or two. I want to capture the responder theme and the blue and red stripes of the brush are going to be great. After that I'll probably be moving along to some Fresca Intensa for the height of summer.\n\n​\n\nY'all have a good day.\n\n​\n\n\\-Robot",

I'm open to suggestions if anyone has some, and if anything, I'd like to pick a CL frag over one of my B&M ones (42, FG, East Egg) or APR (where my only summer scent is Passione) which I wholly don't think will work.",

The slant and Barrbarr set were both new to me, as they were part of my gift for my secret Santa. Speaking of, my secret Santa gift was incredible. Ill post in the thread soon.\n\nBarrbarr smells great. To me it doesnt really smell like a traditional barbershop, but that wasn't the intention. It smells like lemon cookies/gingerbread in a soap. So so good. The vanilla in Eros actually pairs with this scent really nicely.\n\nThe slant was surprisingly incredibly smooth. This is a great value. I could hardly feel the blade and it was very very efficient. A pleasant surprise and a great value at like $12.\n\nHappy weekend everyone!",

Today's Space-Race centric shave features: a rocket-inspired razor made in the same quarter as Kennedy's famous kick-off speech for the Apollo program; a Russian blade bearing the name of their second manned spaceflight program (between Vostok and Soyuz); a soap inspired by the vacuum of space; an aftershave that was popular during the space race and coincidentally goes well with the soap; and whatever perfume was next in line... ah, Eternity! Well, that's a somewhat cosmic name, at least.\n\nSo anyway Orbit! Shaved with it yesterday, used it again today. Still having trouble getting a consistently adequate level of slickness out of the Noble Otter base... I think it works out for me about 20% of the time. The scent is pleasant but mild for my taste - I can hardly smell it during the shave. I can't really pick out any individual notes in the mix. It just smells pleasantly chilly to my nose. Speaking of chilly, I shave with cold water, so mentholated soaps (whether natural or synthetic) tend to feel pretty cold. The first pass with this stuff left my face feeling pretty cool, and the second left it Cold, but not to the point that it was painful. If I were to rate the coldness of my four chilly soap bases on a scale of 1-10 it would go like this:\n\n- 2/10: Proraso White\n\n- 2.5/10: Stirling Chill / Arctic / Tundra / Eskimo / Whatever\n\n- 3/10: Orbit\n\n- 10/10: Stirling Glacial\n\nI should probably try out some Proraso Green too and see where it fits in that spectrum but I'm not a huge fan of the scent.\n\nAs I mentioned yesterday, my Aquatic perfumes have moved away from strictly fruity-floral-aquatic fragrances into fresh-fougère-with-aquatic-undertones fragrances. Today is a second wearing of Eternity. The first time yielded a fantastic barbershoppy citrus & lavender opening and a ho-hum floral-aquatic heart, but then shenanigans went down and I missed the drydown. I'm giving it another shot today because I went in totally blind last time without having a clue what it smelled like (and quickly realized it should have been grouped with my aquatic and fresh fougère tests instead). I feel like I won't be buying a bottle of this stuff because the bottle is pretty ugly, but it would be nice to find something else that exhibits such a fantastic citrus-lavender opening with a better heart and drydown to take its place.",

We went to the zoo this morning, but I decided to shave now rather than wait til after the kiddos go to bed. After my last SOTD shave disaster, I tried purposely to use much less soap. Today's shave was a lot better. I still don't think I have the soap-water ratio down yet, but I have been getting fairly consistently good shaves for the past week or two. Feel like I've turned the corner.\n\nThe 4th shave on this Voskhod blade will be it's last. I don't know how you guys do more than 10, let alone pushing 100.",

It's one of those sets that came in at a time when I had a TON of new stuff I wanted to try, so didn't get used nearly as much as deserved. It's a great soap with a nice straight up lavender scent. Clean smelling and perfect for the summer heat! Boom!!!\n\nI think I'm going to venture into the Comic-Con madness downtown. It gets CRAZY! Tons of people in cosplay etc. it's lots of fun even if I don't have a pass. Downside is parking SUUUUUCCCKKKKKKKKKKKSSSS. Small price to pay =)\n\n\nHappy shaving everyone!",

That was better but not much, the last few will have to find a home in my wives razor.\n\nOverall the rest of the shave was pretty good, the soap lathers well and smells great and the splash performs great as always. I have one more shave left in the soap so we'll see how it performs with a more comfortable blade.",

I had to go all out with the only (true) full set I have with me. This was the scent that defined my deployment, as I used it for almost 3 months in total. Though I grew tired of it at one point, it came back around after a short break (thank you Lather Games). It's definitely a spring scent for me, but can really shine in the summer as well. Can't wait to get back stateside, because I've got a BUNCH of soaps that I can't wait to try/review.",

My original assessment of 'treat it almost like an unscented soap' holds true as I couldn't smell it at all once I put the toner on. The frag today is inspired by a /u/watershitdown post from almost a year ago. I picked up a sample of this yesterday. It's much brighter than 4&P/88 Chestnut, but they work well together. It's like straight lemon rind out the gate, but develops into a smoker smell soon after. This is an excellent frag.",

Guys, I was so impressed by this Level 2 Sabre. And this soap. and I love this brush. Was a banger of a shave for everyone.\n\n#### ❧ Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Blackland - Sabre Level 2 ::: GEM - PTFE SE ‹2 uses›)*\n\nWhat this razor does is maintain a high degree of efficiency while also being stealthy and comfortable. So smooth. My shave quality was excellent, and this may be the smoothest, most comfortable shave I've ever gotten for this level of efficiency.\n\nI actually had to be cautious, I learned after the fact, because the smoothness can inspire a casual hand with the razor. But this can bite you in certain areas because of the high-efficiency. You don't have to be hyper-vigilant, but just a normal amount of care, and in my case not forgetting to stay within certain bounds on my neck, will deliver a great shave.\n\n#### ❧ Soap Notes\n*^(WSP Formula T - Sandalwood)*\n\nSandalwood is my favorite of the simple genres of scents.\n\nScent: A straight, though understated, Sandalwood, with maybe some normal wood in there too. But nothing else to mess up the scent. I sure liked it.\n\nScent Strength: 3-4/10, lightly present during shaving.\n\nLather: This Formula T base is really knocking on the door of the top-tier with its creaminess, slickness, and elasticity. Rinses were luxurious, and the lather was beautiful. Razor had plenty of glide and the shave was very close. I like the Rustic base okay, but this one is much better, IMO.\n\n+ 30 second load with lightly-wet badger brush\n+ 4 tsp water\n+ = 6 passes of lather.\n\n\nThis formulation was very creamy and luxurious. I wouldn't go thicker. So between 3-4 tsp water is the zone for me on this one.\n\nWith 2 extra passes, I might load for a bit less time next chance I get.\n\nBowl - I used the XL version of this bowl:\nhttps://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3392930\n\n#### ❧ Brush Notes\n*^(Maggard Razors - SHD 26 mm - Super High Density‹4 uses›)*\n\nVery nice. I do like this one better than the Stirling, because of a little less backbone. Both are dense and have great soft tips.\n\n----\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Smooth\n*Neck*: Smooth\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Cut flush to where I just see the tips (above average for me)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm) *and also in the sub's sidebar.*\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

I've smelled it on blotters several times but today will be my first time actually wearing it. My big question is whether my nose will get past the massive dose of calone and dihydromyrcenol to smell all the other ingrediments or if those two will just overwhelm everything else.\n\nMitchell's Wool Fat seems to be a hit or miss soap. Some people can't get good results from it no matter how hard they try. Others, myself included, get good results almost without trying. I like it a lot, though I haven't given it a SpongeScore yet and it probably won't be super high. Mild citrus-floral fragrance including hints of violet, lavender, lily of the valley, and citrus peel zest. There's probably more in there but those are the main ones that my nose and ingredient-reading-eyes can detect. I wouldn't say that it's a Strong scent but unlike many mild soaps it Doesn't fade away when you start lathering up and shaving, so you get to enjoy the fragrance the whole way through the shave. I appreciate that.\n\nSomething I do not appreciate are Voskhod blades. I have tried them in every razor I have owned and the result is always a close but uncomfortable shave. The only way I can describe them is \"rough.\" I'm not a fan.",

Woke up a bit later than usual and just lounged in the bed with the wife until our daughter jumped in the bed with us. Snuggled with that little turd for a bit then off to the shower I went. Today is just one of those GOOD days for no real reason, ya know? Just feels good to be around everybody. And I know this feeling will soon fade because we've gotta go shopping for school supplies later on. That's where the lavender cake into play. I needed a calm and soothing scent to help my imminent irritation and nothing beats lavender for me. I love the reserve base of soap and splash both. My skin feels fucking amazing after my shave and I finished it off with the dank lavender of FitD. Ahhh. So damn good.",

Let's start with how much I love the scent. Shaving with the soap is being in a cloud of dark fruit that is slightly resinous. The aftershave brings in more of a dank tobacco that dries down softer and sweeter than the initial hit.\n\nThe soap performance is as good as everyone says. It took me a little longer to get the lather the way I wanted it, but was rewarded with a texture of slightly denser beaten egg whites. Great shave, despite my technique. Still learning how to shave XTG with my face. Problem areas are trying to keep the right angle around the rounding of the chin. It was my first time with a Feather blade. I liked the added aggressiveness to my relatively mild razor. The Astras that I have been using seem to be a little inconsistent from blade to blade in terms of number and quality of shave.\n\nAll in all, a great shaving experience.",

Short version: u/sgrdddy I tried your trick of using aggressive base plates with old blades, I tend to agree with your findings, further testing needed. u/soullesssingularity I had 3 dreams over the weekend. First dream I shaved my face with a vegetable peeler, but left my neckbeard intact. Shaving went much better than expected. I'll try to write up my other dreams later, one involved knee surgery and the other involved Christmas ham!\n\nLife is short, shave with good gear.",

Up first on the right is Cannonball. It's got a shiny lather and smells like a relaxing day at the pool. Now on the left. Orbit goes on and puts up a great show with a dense, slick lather of its own. Both are starting to provide some real coolness by the end of the first round. It's a real back and forth with each soap showing an equal amount of time on the skin. By the third round, the coolness is in full affect with neither side backing down. It's a tight match and both corners are showing slickness, coolness, and great protection. Now for the rinse and dry down.\n\nThe judge is paying close attention to the post shave coolness. Both sides are feeling cool and hydrated. There's no dryness anywhere. The judge is shaking his head. There's no discernible difference. Orbit is trying to strut its amazing fragrance around while Cannonball points out its top tier post shave smoothness. That's it, we have a decision, the judge is calling it. It's a draw! Wow! What a shocker! And what a performance from two amazing competitors.\n\nStay tuned for another showdown coming soon!",

We had a lot going on and it's the start of a busy season for us so I better get used to it. Tried to channel some of yesterday's speed in the shave today and definitely captured some of it. Not all, but enough to make a difference. Big thing was I spent a lot less time dinking around with those tough bits on my chin but still got it nice and close.\n\nReally love this brush and am thinking of using it for Austere August. Need to land on a blade as well. The Gillette green is doing good work - might get it to go the whole month depending on how this one does over the next week or so.\n\nHappy Monday y'all.",

First impression of the Fanchurian is very good. Soft and good backbone, I'd say not quite at dense as SHD, but the tips are a more natural white instead of slightly yellow. Easy and comfortably to splay, certainly no regret in trying this knot out.",

The directions said to add a drop or two and I'll admit that I went a bit overboard. I may have added about 5 but it's ok. Still didn't freeze my face off like adding a dollop of Cryogen to every shave has. It's nice though and I'll definitely try to keep a bottle of this in my den for when the Cryogen runs out. I also think the lower level of menthol will be great for winter shaves when I wouldn't want a completely frozen face but desire a slight tingle instead. Today's blind grab was a tiny sample vial of Taum Sauk EdT I got from a CL order a while back. It's nice and fresh and not overbearing like some of the other scents I have. Definitely a great summer scent!",

Definitely looking forward to getting back to a top tier soap tomorrow; these last four days (Noble Otter, MWF) have not been kind to my face.\n\nFollowed it up with some AV Green because I know from prior experience that its scent is nicely complimentary to both MWF and today's perfume. I've been avoiding the Aqua Velvas so far in these perfume appraisals because they can color my perception of the perfume so strongly, but I feel confident that this is a safe pairing today.\n\nL'Aventure Knight (a GIT inspired fragrance) isn't strictly *aquatic* by most definitions, but it has many of the hallmark attributes of an aquatic: bergamot and tea in its top notes, hefty violet leaf in its heart, and ambergris in its base. It also has a bit of secret dihydromyrcenol, which is the aromachemical that got cranked up to 11 (or more accurately about 22%) in Cool Water, giving that one its unique aquatic character... Thus it suffers from the \"GIT smells like Cool Water\" curse and I had to compare them back to back. There are definitely some similarities in the heart but I wouldn't say they're any more similar than Nautica is to Chrome is to Invictus. I'll get into a little more detail Tuesday when I post my aquatic recap.",

      "body": "Monday 7/22 SOTD\n\n· **Brush**: Stirling 24mm fan\n\n· **Lather**: Noble Otter Orbit\n\n· **Razor**: RazoRock Lupo\n\n· **Blade**: Gillette Platinum (4)\n\n· **Post**: Cremo Cooling balm\n\n· **Frag**: Dior Eau Sauvage EDT\n\n**Product Notes**\n\n**Razor / Blade:** RazoRock was the only company I found with Orbit in stock. So as I was ordering, I thought to meself : \"Self, why not chuck one of those tacky Lupos in the order? The shipping will be the same either way\". (This is the horrible twisted logic found in this wet shaving hobby...)\n\nI had every reason to expect the \"Lupo Uomo\" to be awful. Besides the dicey ethics of cloning another company's product, my personal experience with RR DE's was not inspiring. From the Baby Smooth to the Gamechanger 0.68, to the Mamba (0.53), the RRs had proven to be overly inefficient shavers. Well made, but just not enough firepower to give me a consistent two pass BBS. And the gimmicky low gap / high exposure Baby Smooth had irritated me on more than a few shaves.\n\nWell, the Lupo surpassed all expectations, and actually makes me more inclined to try an actual Wolfman one day. The blade gap here has been estimated as being 0.61mm (the RR site and customer service do not deign to provide this information for their aluminum models - why?) and the head is purported to be copied from the WR1 head, albeit with covered blade tabs.\n\nThis is my second shave on the Lupo, and both have been excellent, matching my standards of the ATT R1 and CG L2 for efficiency and with a milder blade feel. Angle is reasonably broad and intuitive, and the blade is pinned down nicely, offering an ATG cutting action that is both mild and rapidly effective. If this razor costs $100, I would call it a bargain, and $30 is even more impressive.\n\nI got the razor in a deliberately nasty gold anodized finish, and the finish is well-executed and even across all parts of the razor. Fit of the components is superb, more or less an expected RR feature.\n\nIs all perfect? Well, the lather gutters in the bottom of the base plate are on the small side (possibly also true for the WM \"inspiration\") and so the razor needs a bit more rinsing between passes to clean all the lather out.\n\nBiggest deficiency is the awful handle, light enough to feel like plastic, and mostly smooth with a few circular ridges along its length. Feels worse than either the Baby Smooth or the Standard, and the ATT Calypso comes from a different planet.\n\nThe simu-plastic handle is really the one area where the price point shows through. Nonetheless, the handle is functional thanks to the ridging, and I have certainly seen worse handles on costlier razors. (Though none that are both poor and also quite so lightweight.)\n\nSo I am impressed. This is a great cheap shaver. Indeed, I'd even call it a great shaver, price factored out. Is it great because it's a good copy of a great original? Or is it great due to its own merits? Not owning a WM, I have no idea, but perhaps one day I could comment if Buddha, Ganesh, or Apollo (the shaving gods) accommodate me...\n\nThe Gillette Platinum also is on fire this series, and impresses me as a useful compromise between the harsh but efficient GSB and the superb but overpriced Polsilver.\n\n**Soap:** More good news --- the addition of a synthetic cooling agent elevates the NO base for me, and shoots it up from a middling 85 FAYS score to an impressive 92. (It would really be a 95, but I deduct a few points for the \"trick\" of using a cooling agent as an anesthetic.) NO should put this stuff in all its soaps, as my usual complaint with the brand is that the scents are great but the protection and post shave are a bit deficient. The chilly cooling agent here fixes both issues.\n\nThe scent is also lovely - a mix of rose and darker citrus with some wood notes. Not quite the usual NO complexity, but definitely unusual, appealing, and perceptible throughout the shave.\n\nCompared to Terror? Terror is colder, and the less complex scent there is stronger. Terror is the Cyclone, Orbit a log flume with more artistic decorations along the course. Both are great summer soaps, but I would call Terror the more revolutionary base design, as it proves that menthol can be outdone by synthetic equivalents. To be fair, Orbit was not aiming to push the cooling technology envelope, and is a wonderful balanced design that incorporates great cooling with fine scent design.\n\n**Frag:** Maybe the best summer scent from a big perfume maker. A complex and realistic citrus forward design with excellent longevity and projection, and one that has survived numerous reformulations in highly usable form.",

I wanted to compare WSP Tallow lathers with Stirling, and take another hit off my new Maseto Silvertip.\n\n#### ❧ Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Timeless - Stainless Steel .68 - Open Comb ::: Gillette - Nacet ‹169 uses›)*\n\nGreat close shave today, like it was just 70 uses old! :-) Didn't even have to do a touch-up. Seriously folks, when is this thing going to die?\n\n#### ❧ Soap Notes\n*^(Stirling - Mountain Man)*\n\nScent: One of my favorites! Like Silver Mountain Water cologne, from Creed.\n\nScent Strength: 4-5/10, lightly present during shaving.\n\nWSP Matterhorn is based on the same scent, but the Stirling is a stronger smell, so it's a clear winner for me for this scent, due to the lower cost.\n\nLather: Very good creamy, slick lather today. Just the viscosity I like. Excellent performance.\n\nI love how this lather gets so elastic when hydrated the way I like it. Takes a lot of water, but still gives creamy feel to face. Excellent protection and glide.\n\nWas comparing today's lather with the superb ones from WSP Formula T that I've gotten lately. Was just as good for a lot less money per oz. Stirling is awesome!\n\n* 25 second load with a lightly-wet, 3-band badger brush\n* 5 tsp water to build the lather\n* = 5 passes of lather\n\nBowl - I used the XL version of this bowl:\nhttps://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3392930\n\n#### ❧ Brush Notes\n*^(Maseto - Memphis Silvertip 24mm‹2 uses›)*\n\nThe first use of this brush wasn't awesome, but just okay. Well that worked some of the storage chemicals or whatever out, because today was excellent. Not floppy, IMO, and not too stiff. I really enjoyed it. Luxurious.\n\n----\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Cut flush to where I just see the tips (above average for me)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm) *and also in the sub's sidebar.*\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

As the weather has been fairly hot, I thought now would be a good time to give it a try. Overall, not too shabby. I was able to shave off 3 days of growth with 1 less pass than I typically do. Typically I'll do 3 passes on my face, and 4 passes on my neck to get those hard to shave areas. Today, I got good results with 2 passes on the face, and 3 on the neck. Not sure if it is a result of the cold water, or just better technique. I am impressed with how quickly any irritation calms down with the cold water shave though. W/in 30 minutes post shave, my face felt good as new. I will keep up with the cold shaves for at least this week and see how well it goes.",

It won't get up to 70F. Yay!\n\nSince it is overcast and raining vetiver jumped up on my radar. I like this soap base a lot as I always get an excellent and easily ccomplished close shave with it. Plus the strength of the scent seems about right to me, particularly since I am getting another shot of vetiver with my post shave splash and this bottle of *Stirling Vetiver* is proving to be a favorite.\n\nThe Simpson Berkeley is just an excellent badger brush. It is a wee fellow at 20/46mm but it is a very enjoyable and competent Best Badger. Nowhere as wee as the diminutive *Wee Scot* but smaller than average. In the \"olden days\" this would have been a typical size for a badger but no more.",

I've been wetshaving for probably close to a month now, and for the first time in a few weeks I went back to my Merkur Open Comb razor. I also tried a new blade, a Rapira Swedish Supersteel from a sampler pack. When I first tried shaving with this, I cut the crap out of my face. Weepers everywhere. It wasn't pretty. After a few weeks of practice, tonight I was able to get a pretty good shave, with no razor burn or weepers. I wouldn't call it BBS yet, but I was extra cautious with the Merkur since my previous experience with it was painful. I still don't think I have my lather dialed in, but it did the job. I think the Clubman aftershave compliments the Texaus smell.",

Ruds gave it a glowing review, and I was excited to try it out. The scent is a lightly spiced sandalwood, which isn't usually my favorite thing, but it's well done. It has a cologne vibe to it that makes it seem more modern.\n\nThe soap loaded very easily, and the lather was dense and very fatty. Very glossy when hydrated correctly. The slickness great. It was so fatty feeling in fact that it was hard to wash off, which I really like in a soap. Really excellent job with this new base!",

It's primarily melon and orange with some hints of cucumber and green herbs. The base notes won't shine through during the shave and the scent doesn't stick around post-aftershave with this one, so if you want to continue enjoying the scent you're best off spraying some of the real stuff. Still, it's one of the three Stirling fruity-aquatic soaps that I enjoy (the others being Dunshire and Mountain Man). I'm not sure which one I like best, but I sort of lean towards this one.\n\nMy stepfather introduced me to Polo Blue as one of his favored office scents and I thought why the hell not? I picked up a bottle on sale and I quite enjoy it. Brief fruity opening, reasonably long-lived herbal / floral heart, classic leathery-fougère base. It's the least aquatic of my aquatics, which makes it a bit of a transitional step to the next fragrance family in my list: fresh-smelling aromatic fougères, which is actually what this technically is. Still, its opening is noticeably aquatic without being obnoxiously synthetic. An aquatic for folks who don't like aquatics, perhaps? Seems to be a lot of talk about fragrances like that around here lately....",

I still love the base and the aftershave is nice too but holy shit at the smell. This is most definitely another spring and summer scent that I'll do my best to keep around. I'm not normally a fresh and fruity kinda guy, but this and Cannonball both just really scratch an itch I didn't know I had! I had to finish it off with LGC because it's the fruitiest fragrance I've got and I think it works. The peach(?) really bounces off the mango in the aftershave and then they spiral off together in the distance. Great stuff and I'm still super thankful that my Santa hooked me up with the set!",

The fragrance seems familiar and is a clean smell that reminds me of some barbershop fragrances. The soap performs very well. The lather was shiny and slick, and worked up quite easily. Post shave feels good but is hard to judge because I'm sweaty from my shower. I sat with it for a bit and it leaves the skin feeling nourished. Zingari's Troubadour Balm smells very nice and feels good on the skin. My cheeks feel a little tacky so I'll try it on wet skin next time. Overall I'd say this base is very good and I'd like to see some other fragrances with this formulation.",

A bit of a milestone today with the blade. And tried a new scent, Jurate, which I love!\n\n#### ❧ Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Timeless - Stainless Steel .68 - Open Comb ::: Gillette - Nacet ‹170 uses›)*\n\nGreat solid shave, with a close cut. Chugging along.\n\n#### ❧ Soap Notes\n*^(Mickey Lee Soapworks - Juraté)*\n\nThem: \"wrap the warm, rich scent of amber in a blend of woody cedar, hay, sandalwood, with touches of vanilla, rum and cinnamon\"\n\nScent: I'm no fan of amber, but I loved this scent. All the other elements come in and transform the amber into something sophisticated and interesting. Almost a sense of oud here. I liked it more and more during the shave.\n\nCade Balm was a great match for this, and is lasting quite a while, probably amplified by the soap.\n\nScent Strength: 5-6/10, nicely present during shaving.\n\nLather: Nice lather, slick and a little creamy. But not all that much secondary slickness, so make sure you relather as necessary.\n\n* 30 second load with big lightly-wet small boar brush\n* 3 tsp water\n* = 4-5 passes of lather.\n\nBowl - I used the XL version of this bowl:\nhttps://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3392930\n\n#### ❧ Brush Notes\n*^(Semogue - 1250 Boar‹16 uses›)*\n\nNice little brush where tips aren't splitting much yet, but is still comfy due to lower backbone.\n\n----\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Few hairs are showing some tip length (with most being cut flush)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm) *and also in the sub's sidebar.*\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

Handle remains merely adequate, but the shave is excellent. The Platinum still seems to have life left at 5 shaves, so will keep it in service for a bit longer.\n\n**Brush:** Lovely red / purple patterned handle and a high loft easily splayed synth. One of two excellent Yaqis I own, this one being taller and with a slimmer handle.\n\n**Lather**: Very much not a summer scent, FG remains an immensely potent and dark scent, one of the few soaps I use that has a lingering odor for a while after the shave. (The other notable example being Lavanille; see a pattern here?) I have never smelled much of the complexity in FG, getting a vegetative smoky scent with sharp citrus top notes and a muted floral middle. It smells immensely unique, but is not for all.\n\n**Frag**: RG is my wife's least favorite scent - a very powdery anise forward fougere with a woody patchouli base. The geranium and lavender (part of the fougere structure in FG) connects this and the soap - along with the fact that neither is an ideal summer scent!

I found it to be not as smooth as the 0.95, but I'm blaming that on the soap. Not the soap itself because this was my first use of it and I think I didn't add enough water on the first pass. The residual slickness was lacking so I added more water for the second pass and it was much smoother. Tomorrow I'm going to use a soap that I'm very familiar with to give a more fair assessment. I finished off the shave with Admiral AS and EdT. This scent is amazeballs. Don't think you won't like it if you don't like aquatics. Chatillon Lux would never regurgitate some typical department store aquatic scent. Shawn doesn't roll like that. This juice is unique and awesome. I think I might have to grab the soap too.",

For me it reminded me of a more holiday-ish scent with notes of cinnamon and spice. The A&E may be my new favorite base. I thought I had picked up my Parker open comb razor but realized shortly after starting my shave that I was using the Maggard slant. I had not adjusted my technique and did not get punished for it because of the protection from the soap. Great base and some great scents!\n\nAfter doing a lot of reading on r/Wetshaving and seeing all the amazing brush handles, I am starting to want one of the really cool handles. I love my Maggard brush but I saw a brush from Langley City Shave that I am madly in love with. I don't know how eveyone keeps from spending their entire pay check with so much fantastic shaving products out there. One day I WILL have that brush! Hope everyone has a great rest of the week!",

I personally didn't exactly enjoy the scent it and it wasn't very slick and lots of tugging. I am going to assume that I didn't have enough water in the lather and maybe I need a fresh blade. The scent wasn't for me but I don't really know which scents I like yet so I'm sure others will enjoy it. Not ready to give up on it and will try again later this week. No disrespect to the artisan I have heard lots of great things about them and I'm sure it was all user error.",

When I first smelled it, it was alright but not anything outstanding. Now after a few more uses, I find myself craving it. The only other scent that I can remember being drawn too like this is Leviathan (which now I'll probably have to use tomorrow).\n\nI always get a really good shave with the SR. Super close and little irritation. I have to really take my time as I have a few swirls in my neck hair and going in a single direction feels like shaving with a cheese grater. Success today and going back to the Karve and Navet tomorrow.\n\nHappy Tuesday!",

Almost crippled myself yesterday peddling a 4 person bike with 2 people. Seemed like a good idea as the roadways are flat here and scenic on the bay side of the island. Unfortunately the peddles were a little too low for my son to effectively use so it was the wife and I powering this monstrosity of a vehicle. Ended up turning the bike in with 10 minutes left on our rental time but we were both done. At least it was a good workout.\n\nRazor is my first safety and seems to work fine but I have my eye on a few upgrades when the time comes. Looking for something a bit heavier and a 2 or 3 pc as opposed to my current tto setup. Also want to check out a few samples of different blades as I feel my current set up is a bit too mild.\n\n\nSoap wise Arkadia has become my favorite scent of the 3 I have. All 3 Stirling offerings lather and apply well but the scent from Arkadia stands out. Kinda strange liking a warm scent in a warm enviroment but its what Im digging. Next order Ill have to try the Arkadia edt or balm.... Scent wise Ventana is a Sauvage clone but for less than a quarter of the price it works for me even with the scent being not 100% spot on.",

Also wanted to revisit this splash which I remembered giving me a mild reaction last time--today was a lot better. The distressing news w/ this shave was that my Chubby Scrubby no longer seems quite as Chubby....I've had it about a year now and it's my favorite brush, but I've noticed it dropping a stray hair here and there when it never used to before. Over the weekend I cleaned it, and this was the first shave since then....I must have dropped at least 10 hairs this morning. Very troubling. I'll be sad if this one continues to shed. I've tried to be very gentle with it but perhaps I've unconsciously wrung it out too hard from time to time?",

Barrister and Mann Seville in the new Excelsior base. I have always thought the regular glissant Seville soap was the finest soap on the planet. The scent is perfect, I love the glissant base. Everything about it is wonderful. But I used it all and have not had any for a few months. I also have the reserve base of this soap and love it, but not like I love the glissant base. I had previously used Excelsior with the Vespers release and I like it, but it takes some getting used to. You could lather up glissant with no effort and without any thought at all. I use the reserve soaps a ton so they are pretty easy for me to lather too. This one took some time and work. It needs so much water! But I got a really nice lather and it is nice to have Seville back in my repertoire (you gotta save that Seville Reserve for special occasions since it was a limited release, right?). So thanks, secret santa. I love Seville.",

I was very happy with this light tropical scent, which I wanted specifically to please the better half, who doesn't appreciate the dark musky Ouds as much as I do. My first foray into the A&E line was a major success. I particularly love the aftershave, which gave me a pleasant burn and a perfectly toned and smooth face.\n\nI had never used a slant bar before today, and I have to say I'm impressed. No irritation, very mild (this coming from a guy who usually sits at about a 5 on my adjustable) and I got a BBS in 2 passes on my first use of a new razor which is definitely not a given. All in all I'd say everything worked out well!",

What's not to like? I'd consider getting the matching aftershave if I didn't have too much shit already.\n\nDFS and it's HOT today!!!\n\nHappy shaving!",

Because of this I seem to have turned into a someone from the US South, I've started keeping Ice Tea in the fridge and breaking out my seersucker shirt. Any other keeping cool tips from those used to the heat would be much appreciated! The insulation in my house seems to be really really good, which means that once its hot inside it takes forever to cool down, because of that it was about 26 degrees inside when I woke up.\n\nThankfully the Terror samples arrived today so I got to give that a try and so far I'm impressed. It was a long lasting cooling effect that wasn't too much. I paired it with the Cryogen splash and the different was massive, whilst Terror is fairly menthol like and a long sustained burst Cryogen is like one big slap in the face that seems to fade fairly quickly. Compared to the Orbit sample I tried recently it seems to be slightly colder but with less of a scent. Either of them would work right now, but Terror is the sample I have left.\n\nThis may have to be my shave for the rest of the week with Cryogen swapped out for Taum Sauk / Colbeck depending on how I feel. Terror is certainly going to get used as soon as I can.",

This is one of my favorite scents of all time. It reminds me of when I was a little kid and how my grandfather used to smell when he came home from his garage after a day of fixing cars and drinking coffee. It's always a good shave and makes me smile.\n\nHope you all have a good hump day.\n\nHappy Wednesday!",

      "body": "**2019-07-24 SOTD: Magical Perfumery Tour - ~~Fragrant~~ Fougère Fun 1/8**\n\n**Razor:** Fatip Piccolo SE (Gentile)\n\n**Blade:** Lord Platinum (shave #3)\n\n**Brush:** Yaqi 24mm Moka Express Synthetic\n\n**Lather:** Stirling Blu\n\n**Post:** Nivea balm\n\n**Fragrance:** [Legend by Montblanc](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Montblanc/Legend-11784.html)\n\n**Thoughts:**\n\nNot entirely happy with this razor & blade combo. Doesn't feel sharp enough. I remember liking this blade better in my Tech when I was just shaving every second day.\n\nToday I make the jump from aquatics and aquatic-tinged fougères to flat-out fougères, complete with lavender and coumarin and oakmoss oh my. Most of my favorite perfumes are fougères (especially barbershoppy ones) and I've got a few that I need to compare, so I'm going to finish my July with a few relative newcomers and a few old favorites.\n\nLegend is uplifting and sweet with a variety of fresh and dried fruity notes, smooth lavender, subtle floral notes, and a quiet base of coumarin, tonka, oakmoss, and sandalwood. Excellent blending of natural and synthetic notes in this one, as far as I'm concerned! I love the way it smells. It's very happy stuff. I just wish it was stronger and lasted longer... it's unacceptably weak. Reasonably priced if you buy a tester bottle online, at least.\n\n*****\n\n***Aquatic Onslaught Overview: The Wettening***\n\nMany modern aquatic fragrances get hate online for being \"generic.\" I get it. After wearing 11 aquatics in a row, many of them do honestly have a lot in common... but does that make them inherently bad? Nah, it just means they aren't very unique, but so what? Perfume companies sell products that people want to wear, and most of these fragrances are certainly worth wearing (for the right occasion).\n\nNow, understand: \"aquatic\" doesn't necessarily mean \"smells like the ocean and all its contents\" in the world of perfume (though I sort of wish I could find a perfume that does!) Rather, aquatic notes are usually things that we *associate with* water, like melons, fresh rain, a dewey morning meadow, tea, seaweed, etc. Mostly it means Calone (aka watermelon ketone; sea-breeze, slightly floral, ozonic, melony) and dihydromyrcenol (lavender, lemon, lime, sweet, sometimes woody or metallic) because those are the two big notes that perfume companies have taught us to associate with the word Aquatic. They get used in a lot of modern household cleaners and air fresheners too (especially laundry products), so to a lot of youngsters they'll just smell like fresh laundry or shower gel. Don't expect any of these to smell anything like the beach. And remember! All our noses are different. This is just what **I'm** getting out of these perfumes. They might smell different to you.\n\nInstead of listing the fragrances in the order that I wore them, I'm going to list them in order from AHOY THERE MATEY to ARE YOU SURE THIS IS AN AQUATIC.\n\n[Invictus](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Paco-Rabanne/Invictus-18471.html) is basically what I wish Acqua di Gio would be: it has a nice, fresh, sweet, juicy grapefruit-orange opening with a fun sweet jasmine-aquatic heart that seems to last forever. The aquatic sensation in this one is very smooth and fresh like a happy shower gel. Some would describe it as sporty; I would describe it as joyous and playful. I can't comment on the base notes because I enjoyed the heart so much that I re-applied mid day and never experienced the drydown on its own. It has a poor rating on Fragrantica because a lot of people are tired of stock aquatics and vote \"hate,\" but as far as stock aquatics go this one is really well done. Based entirely on the shape of the bottle, I would associate this perfume with young jocks wearing letter-jackets. Don't let people see it if you want them to think you have any class.\n\n[Invictus Legend](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Paco-Rabanne/Invictus-Legend-54323.html) has a similar citrus opening and a similar aquatic-floral heart, but there's an added tropical fruit in there that I can't quite put my finger on. The heart doesn't last as long as the original and it quickly shifts gears into an amber-dominated base with hints of woods. It's subtle and classy and good if you enjoy amber (which I do). If you want a mostly-aquatic fragrance, get the original. If you just want an aquatic opening with a long amber drydown, go with this one.\n\n[Cool Water](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Davidoff/Cool-Water-507.html) is probably the earliest successful mainstream aquatic, though if you pull the massive doses of dihydromyrcenol and Calone out of the formula the result looks more like a classic aromatic fougère. To *my* nose, those two notes dominate the experience of wearing this perfume. It starts out with an intense zippy aquatic vibe with some lemony, green facets; gradually shifts gears to a smoother and sweeter aquatic heart; and eventually transforms into a pleasant amber / not-stinky-tobacco / sandalwood base. It isn't as lighthearted and fresh and fun as the Invictus style of aquatic - it's a deeper, darker, more complex fragrance. The notes are well blended and not much stands out as being distinct to my nose... in the end, Cool Water just smells like Cool Water to me.\n\n[Nautica Voyage](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Nautica/Nautica-Voyage-913.html) is back in the \"fresh smooth aquatic\" camp with Invictus. It's firmly focused around apple, as far as my nose is concerned. It gradually shifts from a picture perfect \"Green Apple Jolly Rancher\" fragrance to a more abstract sweet aquatic / floral-musk / apple-blossom haze as the day goes on, but it keeps a cheerfully childish apple aura from start to finish. Super cheap and easy to find, this is a killer deal.\n\n[Acqua di Gio](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Giorgio-Armani/Acqua-di-Gio-410.html) has an indistinct citrus/peach opening, an indistinct sweet-aquatic-jasmine-floral heart, and a literally unmemorable drydown: by the time I sat down to record my thoughts at the end of the day I could not remember anything about it. That's not a great sign. I feel like this fragrance suffers from being half-way between two extremes: an exacting representation of its constituent notes and a totally abstracted accord that creates something otherworldly. You can pick out the main notes but they aren't very clear or distinct, yet they're still sitting there in a sort of hazy way. I prefer Stirling's Dunshire interpretation of this fragrance, which is much more focused and vibrant with less fuzz around the edges.\n\n[Eternity](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Calvin-Klein/Eternity-For-Men-258.html) was one of the early \"fresh fougères\" that helped crush the powerhouse perfume era of the '80s. It's very Barbershop up front with intense citrus and lavender. If I could have an aftershave that smelled like the opening of Eternity and nothing else, even just for five minutes, I'd shell out real dollars right now. Anyway, after a few minutes it shifts gears and transforms into a smooth, Calone-heavy, herbal-floral heart with a scent that gradually gets more and more tiresome through the day. I don't feel like the opening and heart of this fragrance belong together - they're too disjointed. I enjoy the way it starts but the fun doesn't last with this one (for me). Also the bottle is butt-ugly.\n\n[Chrome](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Azzaro/Chrome-788.html) is really hard for me to pin down and it marks a turning point where the fragrances in my list stop being overtly aquatic. It's at that \"totally abstract accord\" end of the spectrum and its massive list of ingredients is held together in a tenuous balance. When it's not tipping toward one of its components, the scent is unique, fresh, and otherworldly to my nose - it has no analog in nature. When it tips off balance it gives me varying hints of citrus, sweet fruit, white florals, smooth fresh aquatics, fresh laundry, walking through a fine sprinkler mist on a hot summer day, etc. It's quite linear aside from the brief moments where your nose picks up some of the individual notes and goes \"hey I know that smell!\" I like it. Good for hot weather.\n\n[Polo Blue](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Ralph-Lauren/Polo-Blue-1198.html) is basically an aquatic-tinted aromatic fougère, complete with \"velvety moss\" and secret fern-centric aromachemicals and everything. It opens with tangerine, cantaloupe, and cucumber; grows lightly herbal and smoothly floral with *hints of melony Calone* in its basil / sage / geranium heart; and has a warm, classy suede / musk / amber drydown that somehow makes me think of freshly laundered suede, if one could do such a thing. It's one of my favorite summer office scents - present but mild, fresh yet classy. It'll never leap out of your cubicle and shout \"hey this guy stinks like cologne!\" or \"who wants to go clubbing?\" to your coworkers. Its only weakness is literally that it's a bit weak compared to some of the louder aquatics in this list.\n\n(Continued below.)",

Gael Laoch May have been just the slightest bit cooler but it's essentially equal. Neither soap caused a tear inducing response but were both plenty cool enough to provide excellent summertime relief.\n\nGael Laoch's fragrance, which is a Creed Viking dupe, is the clear victor over Mile High Menthol's heavy medication aroma of menthol, eucalyptus, and camphor. Catie's Bubbles is the clear victor in the functionality category.\n\nWhile Murphy and McNeil's Base is nothing to turn your nose up to, Catie's Bubbles easily whipped up into an amazing slick lather that just made for a better, closer shave. Catie's Bubbles was also better in the post shave where Murphy and McNeil was more drying for me.\n\nWhile both soaps are very good, the judge has given this round to Mile High Menthol!\n\n(Disclaimer: I bought all this stuff myself and used zero science in my evaluation)",

The scent was gender neutral, very black tea forward, and overall pretty good. Even though I really want to like the scent (because it is nice), I just can't because I get a kind of grandma vibe off it. So scent wise its personally not for me.\n\nFor performance, I loved it. Very easy to lather and to work with. Gave good protection and slickness.\n\nI purchased a NO sample because I wanted to test if I do react to lanolin or not. By the time I got to my third pass, I started getting a burning sensation again. I finished the pass and rinced thoroughly and after about 5 minutes there was no more burning sensation (good post shave feel though). So I think Lanolin soaps are out for me, which is a bummer.",

I wish I could put in more time with the razors but Auster August is coming so I don't have much time. Might use the 102 tonight.",

The 24mm Tuxedo has become the \"Basic Bastard\" of wet shaving for a reason - drama free loading, efficient and pleasant lather application, and a quick cleanup, along with excellent long term durability. The Toyota Camry of shaving brush knots, which is not at all a bad thing.\n\n**Razor / Blade:** Still liking this combo - an unexpected delight. A razor I expected to be a middling knockoff that turns out to be a great shaver, and a blade I have barely used that turns out to have more legs than I would have suspected.\n\n**Lather:** Very clever scent work here simulating aquatic notes with floral ones. This was a limited edition for Pasteur's, though the core design is being re-used in the pending Talbot fly fishing themed scent, Chickamauga Creek or something like that...\n\n**Frag:** Often called the poor man's Aventus due to the top pineapple notes, LPH is not really about pineapple or at least not intentionally so - the florals in the middle take over quickly, and then the base of patchouli and civet lasts foreverish thereafter. LPH has aged better than many 80s powerhouse masculines, partially because Aventus has become so popular, but mainly because the sweet notes balance and lighten the composition.\n\nWorth a try for all, especially at its low price and mass market availability. Bear in mind though that applying more than two squirts of this is treated as use of a WMD by the UN, with serious potential sanctions.",

It lived up to its reputation as a less aggressive blade while still removing hair with relative ease and gave a close, irritation free shave, helped along tremendously by the slickness and protection of Noble Otter's soap base. I live in an area with quite hard water and it was a top performer for me in those conditions, but recently I've been experimenting with distilled water shaves and oh boy does this soap perform better than ever. I think I'll be investing in some powdered citric acid soon so I can simply soften the water from the tap, but a gallon of distilled water seems like it'll last a couple weeks anyway. All my soaps are performing leaps and bounds better than before and I couldn't be happier. Who knew 99 cents of distilled water was all that was standing between me and a consistently decent lather lol.",

Yesterday, i studied the B&B straight razor guide. I then shaved with a soap i knew how to properly lather since TTS 2.0 is my first DG Soap. This shave was AMAZING. No, i didn't get a BBS and it was only a two-pass with the grain but man, it was great. For me, the feeling was akin to using a DE razor after years of cartridge razors. It was phenomenal.\n\nTo top it off i used Admiral and i cannot get enough of it. So much so i instantly went and bought the soap. If you haven't gotten it, do yourself a favor and do it.

It lasted for about an hour, I'm curious as to how much longer *Terror* lasts with my skin.

      "body": "Best shave of my life by far\n\nPrep: Hot shower and Nivea face scrub\n\nRazor: Rockwell 6s on plate 3, about 10 minutes after it came in the mail\n\nBlade: Astra SP\n\nBrush: Stirling badger 26mm fan\n\nSoap: Stirling Glacial, Eskimo Tuxedo\n\nPost shave: first time trying alum, will use it from now on\n\nAS: Stirling Glastonbury\n\n\nWOW this razor is a step up from my 34c. It's much more efficient, yet much less blade feel and irritation. It seems to be more aggressive but with better geometry and less blade exposure. I still irritated myself in a couple spots because I was accidentally using pressure despite the heavier handle. After correcting this things were great.\n\nAfter 3 passes and some buffing, I'm as close to BBS as I've ever been. Can still feel some chatter when rubbing my hands against the grain, but otherwise damn it's smooth.\n\nI felt the alum a little, but then there was basically no burn with the AS. I've previously had issues with the alcohol messing with my skin but not this time\n\nNext shave I'll try the B plate, as I feel I need more efficiency on my first pass. I'll start with R4, and then flip to R2 for passes 2 and 3",

I interview with them today and we will see how things go but I hold all the cards this time.\n\nWhen I left, it was due to pay and I was very open and transparent with my boss that money was the sole reason I was leaving.

They *have* to know that because it was the whole reason that I left in the first place.\n\nI am going to be so goddamn disappointed in them if they try to make me some lowball offer. There's no way they could be that stupid. I have to believe.\n\nWish me luck, brothers. I will update in the morning.",

Like someone else recently commented (u/nameisjoey maybe?), the shave itself always feels a bit awkward but I end up with great results. I'm not sure if that's due to the Vector's slim head design or the extra width of the AC. I'd be interested to try an ATT SE1 sometime. I noticed ATT now has a stainless Calypso handle, which looks awesome.\n\nAs far as AC blades, Schick Proline outperformed Kai for me, hands down. Today I used a Feather ProGuard for the first time. I'll have to give it some time and compare to the Proline, but it was nice.",

I could have gone Cryogen / Cryogen but I doubt I could have managed that comfortably. As it was Terror / Cryogen is a great combo for a bit long Menthol from the Terror and a big up front menthol hit from the Cryogen.\n\nUnfortunately the Terror sample is almost done, it does seem to use more soap per shave than other samples I've had. Not sure if this is me wanting more menthol so over loading or just a property of the soap.",

What a great shave today! At first when I smelled the soap, I got no smoky note at all, but the smoke emerged when lathered. I get mostly citrus and some green notes. But, the star of the show is the splash. The smoke note is less prominent to me, and the citrusy and green notes shine. It's really beautiful. Amazing job by /u/Hawns.",

There are so many shades of grey in it with all its slightly different florals that the overall impression just became broadly \"floral soap\" with no distinct focus to its broad chord of notes. I'm giving it another try today and tomorrow to see if I can pick some more detail out of it and perceive it as more than just soapy. Shaving performance is nice though.\n\nFor fragrance today I'm taking a slight detour out of fougère territory because I remembered that I have a flanker sample from yesterday's scent and I've never tried it! A glance at the notes list makes me go \"[aww yiss, motha fuckin](http://www.harkavagrant.com/index.php?id=125) cardamom and lavender.\" Hopefully it smells as intoxicating as yesterday's fragrance but offers better performance... FOUR SPRAYS gave me about an hour of projection yesterday and then it was just a faint skin scent for the rest of the day. Weak sauce.",

During the Lather Games, I \"shaved\" once with a leftover sample of APR I'd gotten in a trade forever ago. Come to find out, I'd way overwatered the damn soap because it probably wasn't enough to shave with but I tried it anyway. It was pretty good, but nothing to write home about. Well, today's different. Holy fucknuts that was a wonderful shave and my face feels wonderful right now. I took my time adding water and my patience was rewarded with thick, voluminous piles of lather that resembled a mixture of cool whip and marshmallow fluff. Torchwood seemed a leather-forward woody scent and I didn't have anything near that in my den, so I pulled out good 'ol Roam. I just made sure I didn't overdo it and could still catch some hints of the soap through it. I finished it off with Rhino, because leather. That one scent note is really starting to rank higher and higher in my books these days. I never woulda thunk it, but here I am. My mind is made up. I miss definitely gonna fork over the cash and get a set of APR now. Overall, I'm most definitely impressed with today's shave.",

Yesterday was a whirlwind and I'm absolutely exhausted but the weekend is within smelling distance so I'm holding on for that. I'm going to work on polishing off the last of this tub just to make some space in my drawer (I can't rightly call it a \"den\". It's a big drawer with lots of shelves but it's still, at the end of the day, a drawer). Really like this stuff still and I'm sure I'll come back to it but with limited space I just can't afford to have a full tub with a Ring O' Soap left in it.\n\nWorked on more j-hooking on the chin today and I think I'm getting it down. It still scares the daylights out of me if I'm not being SUPER careful but I dig the results so am going to keep at it.\n\nAugust is on my mind and not sure if I'm going to go Nightmare or Ultra-Nightmare...\n\nOh well.

It has a sharpness to it, typical of colognes, but just enough going on to tamp it down. The splash is stronger than the soap but I found them to be identical. The splash scent really sticks to the skin. It's string enough that I didn't want to add a frag today for fear of conflicting scents.\n\nThis was my first use of a high mountain white silvertip. It was incredibly dense and thankfully it didn't gobble up all my lather as I find is often a problem with HD brushes. Like applying lather with a cloud, it has zero scritch which usually is welcome for me.",

Been using it since I got it in the mail Friday. Wolfman clone, but with a few tweaks, right? It's easily my lightest razor. It has a lot of blade feel and it's plenty efficient, but it's not scary. It being so light helps me to keep the pressure at nil. I can buff with no issues. I guess for some people the lack of weight can be an issue. I actually quite like it.

I've seen a few people ask how these compare so I threw Terror on the left cheek and Orbit on the right.\n\nBoth of these bases are fantastic and comparing just that is a challenge. In the end it comes down to shaveability. The Noble Otter Base works better for me. I find that the shave is more comfortable and I can really get into the nooks and crannies with confidence. I also like the post shave of Noble Otter much more. My skin is smooth to the touch with very little dryness.\n\nFor the fragrance category, the simple notes of Terror actually work very well once lathered up. The Orbit fragrance however, is better to me so this category also goes to Noble Otter.\n\nFinally we get to coolness. Orbit is cool but Terror is downright cold. The coolness of Terror is noticeably stronger and lasts much longer. I was still feeling the effects 15 to 20 minutes after the shave.\n\nAnd now to the ever so sexy judge. If it were just any old soap with a ton of cooling to it, Orbit would be the victor. **BUT**, this is Menthol Madness and Terror is very very good in all categories. For that, this round goes to Terror.\n\n(Disclaimer: I bought Orbit myself, Terror was a free sample with my East Egg order. I used zero science in my evaluation)",

Loading the sample from a bowl is not fun but this soap seemed to load quicker. It also lathers quite easily and makes for a very well performing lather. Being a sample however, I don't think I had enough soap for a second or third pass but I went with it anyway.\n\nOverall, I was impressed by the vegan base. Left the skin feeling good and a tiny amount of stirling balm was enough to make this a great shave.\n\nI should remember not to use such dense brushes for samples again... Have a good Thursday!",

I had to bite the bullet and try AoS cream. Sam's had a good price on it.\n\nAlso, I heard from a YT viewer that Kevy Shaves mentioned me on his channel! I like his vids already, so that was special. Word got to him that I was 150+ on a blade, apparently.\n\n#### ❧ Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Timeless - Stainless Steel .68 - Open Comb ::: Gillette - Nacet ‹172 uses›)*\n\nClose comfy shave!\n\nNo tugging or irritation.\n\n#### ❧ Soap Notes\n*^(Art of Shaving Cream - Sandalwood)*\n\nScent: a good sandalwood scent with maybe some musk or powder thrown in. I really enjoy this scent.\n\nScent Strength: 5/10, nicely present during shaving.\n\nLather: definitely not deserving of the $25 price that Target and Walmart have it for, IMO. And if it wasn't for the great scent, I'd consider the $17 Sam's Club price a bit too much as well.\n\nLather was just okay, kinda like Proraso. So my advice is to save some bucks and get some $5 Proraso Red at TJMaxx/Marshall's etc.\n\n* 1/4 tsp cream\n* started with lightly-wet boar brush\n* 2.5 tsp water to build the lather\n* = 5 passes of lather.\n\nBowl - I used the XL version of this 3D-printable bowl:\nhttps://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3392930\n\n#### ❧ Brush Notes\n*^(Omega - 10098 Boar‹17 uses›)*\n\nA little bit of prickle, so still waiting on this guy to soften up.\n\n----\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Few hairs are showing some tip length (with most being cut flush)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm) *and also in the sub's sidebar.*\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

The humidity finally broke this week and my runs have been a bit more enjoyable.\n\nTrying out a few Murphy & McNeil soaps i received lately in a pass-around. Today's Ouroboros like the others I've tried is a nice scent, the soap lathers easily and provides great slickness. I don't care for the after-shaves too much. To me, the scents highlight other notes from the soaps and there is no staying power. I usually lose the scent 1-2 hours after the shave. I did purchase the Gael Loach set and looking forward to trying that out",

Southern Witchcrafts has been come my most owned and most used soaps. The smells, performance pricing and people, are all great. Necromantic is one of their soaps I slept on and shy'ed away from though, don't think i'd smelled it until recently, because rose is listed as a note, and based on the 'romance' description, I was figuring it was prominent. See, rose and I don't get along. Rose is like violet for me, if I get a sniff of it it's all I can smell and I can't stop smelling it. I gave Necromantic a wack though and I really don't get much rose. It's there if I really go searching for it but it's not prominent. I definitely get way more of the red wine/honey/ozone which combines nicely.\n\nI'm not really a huge fan of non-alcohol based splashes, so I did sneak in a little Chatillon Lux Unscented before using the Necromantic splash. Face feels good.\n\nSW trifecta good. A+++ Sellers and product, will do business with again.",

I was almost too careless with my shave. It has been said before and I'll say it again, B&M has an amazing soap base. Happy Thursday everyone!\n\nedit: grammar",

Proof that there is no such thing as spatial determinism!\n\n**Lather:** It's summer - why not use the really cold soaps repeatedly? The Exclesior base only gets better with synthetic menthol added.\n\n**Post:** In the interests of science, I addressed the question of fratricidal menthol burn when used after synthetic cooling agent. The soap felt cold --- and then the menthol splash also felt cold, a difference from using the same splash after a menthol soap. So cold plus cold, good if you want it. Of course Krampert's doesn't span the generations in terms of longevity like the Terror splash does, but it's still an excellent post shave design.\n\n**Frag:** An interesting \"aromatic chypre\" featuring clove and cinnamon notes over a leathery oakmoss incense base. The oakmoss has been trimmed a bit on this IFRA compliant reformulation, and as a result, the power and longevity have fallen a bit. Still an excellent sub $20 scent on Amazon, and a fragrance that has aged well - no longer a room clearer, but shows the complexity of the way masculines used to be designed.",

When I saw Creed Viking clone I had to get this one. It's been a while since my Creed decant ran out but it's pretty close. I actually got the mentholated version of the soap and splash. It worked out pretty well for a muggy hot day. The soap base was pretty creamy. Fun soap.",

Everything about this shave reminds me of why this hobby is so awesome. The quality, depth, and uniqueness of the scent, the perfection of the shave itself thanks to the soap and splash ingredients, and an understanding of just how superior our artisans (and the knowledge of a wiser generation of wet shavers before us) can make this shaving experience vs. the daily toil of a Gillette Mach 3 and canned foam, or the supposed \"upgrade\" of Dollar Shave Club's accouterments.\n\nThen I got thinking even further, and realized that my two most used sets this week (Seville in Reserve soap and splash + EdT, and Reserve Waves soap/splash/EdC) basically have roots in this subreddit. They're impossible without the good work of the man himself, /u/BostonPhotoTourist, of course. But we likely wouldn't have the former without the apparent persistence of /u/nameisjoey, and the latter without /u/TheManWhoDoneIt putting Gillette Wild Rain at the forefront of Will's attention. So thanks, guys. And to all the artisans and folks on this sub who make the hobby so fun. Cheers.\n\nEdit: Somehow forgot today is Admiral day, so /u/nameisjoey probably won't see this because he's bathing in a tub of Admiral toner for the next 12-16 hours.",

A few days ago, i had a horrible shave. I was trying out cold water shaving, and to my dismay, my Razorock \"What the Puck\" shave soap did not lather at all. My neck got all cut up because i was in a rush and didn't feel like breaking out a different soap. SO yesterday and today i used \"Ol' Reliable\" to get me through, and loe and behold, i am irritation free today. I really love Cella, it never fails me. The Treet blade is so nice and mild that i can repeatedly go over spots on my neck that a few days ago were bloody messes. God bless Italy and Pakistan for making Cella and Treet respectively",

Today was only my second time using the GWS blades after having a great first shave with them a couple of days ago. Although today wasn't a bad shave, I received some irritation around the chin area, which I think was due to a combination of too much razor pressure and a suboptimal lather. I am starting to see diminishing returns from my badger brush I bought when I first got into wet shaving a few months ago. I'm considering buying the WCS synthetic after reading good things about it.",

Performance of this soap base continues to be amazing. Loaded effortlessly off the puck and I had enough left over lather for a lather porn shot after 20 seconds of loading, tops.\n\nI am in love with this musky, dark scent. It's really intense and complex and I can see myself reaching for it often. Ariana & Evans aftershave continues to knock my socks off, the post shave+ skin food formula is amazing.

This time I loaded about twice as long, and added more water, until the lather looked and felt very slick. I don't know whether to attribute another disappointing shave to bad lather technique, or to the Dorco blade I tried today, but I still did not feel as lubricated as I'd like. The blade felt like it was scratching me on a few occasions. It also could have been bad razor technique, as I'm still a newbie and don't have the muscle memory yet.\n\nThe resulting shave today had a little bit of razor burn, and 2 weepers. One of the more painful shaves in recent history once the Clubman hit my face, and now about an hour later, my face still feels almost a little bit raw in a few spots. It was a close shave, approaching BBS.\n\nI'm headed to Michigan tomorrow for a bit of a vacation. I'm taking Gillette Silver Blues and Polsilver blades with me, along with the Super Speed, and my tub of Ghost Town Barber. While I'm there, I hope to visit Maggard's in person and pick up a few things.",

The scent was not what I was expecting, but it's growing on me. The fragrance off the puck is subtle, and as I've found with A&E, the real star is the aftershave. It ties in all the notes and makes everything bolder. The performance of the soap is as good as everyone says. What surprised me was how soft the aftershave makes my skin feel. While the milky white liquid is a little strange at first, there's no denying how good it is at what it does. I think the aftershaves from A&E and The Club steal the show. Even as I'm typing this, the dry down is getting better and better. Will be using the EDT as well before going out tonight.",

Such a great scent. I can see how this one is kind of an evolution of Khalifa. It's a bit on the sweet side (I think that's the apple), but it opens up nicely when lathered up. As always, I love the lasting power and skin food combination of the A&E splashes. It's been a few hours since I shaved and I'm still getting random whiffs of the scent. Have a great day, folks!",

This sample came from /u/Cadinsor. Before today I had never tried a soap from ALM. The scent is very nice. The performance is very good. Of the samples I recently received though, I like donkey milk and honey soap from Le Pere Lucien the most. That said, today's sample is no slouch.",

In the tub, Lavioletta is pretty and floral. Lathered up it transforms and becomes more spicy-floral (lavender?) with some soapy green-ness (violet?). Not my kind of scent but still gets points for smelling good (just not my kind of good). Nice and intuitive to use - just lather and add water until it's thick and shiny and boom you're good. Slick, thick, protective, moisturizing, etc. Great performance though I don't know how it'll handle winter skin - gotta reserve that judgement for another half year. For now I'll give it a tentative [SpongeScore](https://old.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/c8lhoc/wednesday_sotd_thread_jul_03_2019/esnz1hp/) of 7/10 with room to move upward if it impresses me in -40° weather.\n\nBack on track with my fougères after yesterday's ho-hum detour, today I'm wearing DGPH. The biggest features of this one, TO ME, are a big *slightly sour* citrus opening, an extended citrus-lavender-clary sage heart, aaand not much in the way of base notes. (This one usually disappears around lunch time for me and there isn't much past the heart when I wear it.) I personally prefer my citrus-lavender accords to be a little sweeter and prettier, but this one feels nice and grown up and makes for a nice contrast.",

Damn y'all. This is a smoky but forgiving scent that I think works pretty well with ES. It's sweet and smoky like the actual smell of marshmallows roasting over an open fire which really sets the scene with the citronella from ES. Pretty damn great combo here that I'm happy with. And speaking of ES, just wanted to update that the hole is growing larger by the day. If you want to kill a soap, the best thing to do is to start wet shaving your bawls. Shaving once or twice a day with the same soap really eats away at it pretty fast. I should be done before AA starts. Speaking of which, I found a bar of Stag bath soap, so I may just go full stag for a month. Still not 100% sure either way yet.",

Three shaves in, this is now a very nice, mellow and fresh smelling scent to me. This morning was a quick shave and I absolutely enjoyed it.\n\nRest of the setup is becoming very comfortable. I managed to load just the right amount of soap to get excellent lathers for all three passes and very little remaining after.\n\nTwo drops of the AS is all I needed and it went on smooth on a damp face. Skin is smooth and clean feeling without any tacky or oily feel to it. Maybe I could have used another drop :P I get whiffs of the scent every once in a while but nothing too strong. Perfect for the office.\n\nGreat way to start hot summer Friday. Have a good one folks!",

I trusted in the lather and kept watering it (love a thirsty soap) until it was juuuuuuust right. Felt great on the skin, lots of slickness that stuck around and felt like good cushion too. Did my usual two pass plus clean up with some j-hooking on the chin. It was one of the best shaves I've gotten all month and the SMELL was just amazing. I kept getting different notes through the loading, lathering and shave and really enjoyed it. My better half also commented on the scent and liked the complexity. Called me fancy which is always nice compliment J\n\nToner was fab - I heeded advice and make sure to put a small amount on a damp face. When I first started wet shaving I was just using lavender witch hazel as my post shave and this brought me back to that. I like my alcohol splashes but it's nice having a non-alcohol option. Good staying power on the scent too - I keep getting whiffs of it which is always a plus for me.\n\nI don't want to use this LE for AA so I'm going to have to get a few more shaves in before it kicks off J\n\nHappy Friday everyone.",

Apparently, I ruffled more feathers when I left than I realized. That, and I remember how unhappy I was there when I left. I'm going to call my former supervisor in just a bit and thank them for the opportunity but I must decline.\n\nBut on to happier things.\n\n/u/sgrdddy [asked](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/chkvk6/thursday_sotd_thread_jul_25_2019/euvq9pl/) about this brush yesterday and I'll answer him here.\n\nThe *only* other badger brush I've ever used is [this 24mm fan](https://www.stirlingsoap.com/collections/shave-brushes/products/finest-badger-shave-brush-24mm-fan-knot-green) from Stirling.\n\n[This WCS brush](https://www.westcoastshaving.com/collections/silvertip-badger-shaving-brushes/products/wcs-ancient-stone-collection-silvertip-shaving-brushes) is silvertip and it is softer than the Stirling brush and lathers just a bit better. I reach for it over the Stirling brush now.\n\nAnd that is my big fancy analysis. My experience with badgers is pretty limited but I'd like to try some others someday. Maybe even the mythical B batches.\n\nFougere Trois today. Can't say I'm in love with this scent but the performance is great. I think I'm gonna try to move it and my tub of APR Winterfall.\n\nHappy Friday everyone. I really appreciate the well-wishes over the course of this week. Y'all are awesome.

The recommendations focused on Maggard's SHD setups, and the Stirling Finest brushes. The Maggard handles didn't speak to me, so I went Stirling.\n\nAfter the dish soap and lathering break in, it's time to shave with it. It took a little adjustment to get used to how much water natural hair holds compared to even really nice artificial bristles, and the size was a change, but it was nice. I'm glad I dove in... thanks for the advice!\n\nThe rest of the gear is very much a known quantity for me, and gave me my usual great shave.",

Doesn't matter how it shaves, 2-3 uses, I toss it. I pretty much eliminated that lotto of a bad shave every now and then by doing that...I've been really like the S1, so I figured i'd give taking a blade a little longer a try....4 shaves, fine, hey! A longer use than i've had in a while! First cheek went OK, then when I got down near my chin it was definitely tugging a tiny bit. NOPE. Swapped the blade. Props to those who can get blades to 100, or even 5, but i'm gonna pass and stick to 2-3. I mean they are literally like 10-15 cents. I can afford 30 cents a week on blades.",

      "body": "Friday 7/26 SOTD\n\n· **Brush**: WCS 26mm Tall Boss 2 synthetic\n\n· **Lather**: Stirling Glastonbury beef tallow base\n\n· **Razor**: RazoRock Lupo\n\n· **Blade**: Gillette Platinum (8)\n\n· **Post**: B&M Terror splash\n\n· **Frag**: Dali Pour Homme EDT\n\n**Product Notes:**\n\n**Brush:** The Chevy Camaro of brushes - a lot of engine in an inexpensive relatively non-luxurious package. One of the cool things about badgers is that they retain warmth in the core of the knot for the first pass or two during the shave. The neat thing about bigger synths (26mm +) is that they do the same thing, and so simulate one of the most unique things about badger brushes. Don't know if the BOSS 2 is really all that much of an advance over other fibers, but this is a big, dense, knot with a high loft and so splays easily and has both softness and backbone. For less than $20, this is a badger killer, at least if you don't mind the sizable knot. Nice big ergonomic handle also!\n\n**Razor / Blade:** Another AC quality shave today, The two pass BBS lasts a few hours less than an AC shave does, but the ease of the shave and the fact than a BBS is so easily obtained here recommends the combo.\n\n**Lather:** I used to be a tallow type agnostic, but darned if the second example of Stirling beef tallow I tried does not perform a bit worse than the two examples of the mutton tallow I tried from that brand. (Note I have the older Glastonbury; new version of that scent uses the mutton.) The comfort and post shave is about five points higher on the FAYS scale with mutton. The Glastonbury scent is all about patchouli, maybe the best dirty hippy scent in all wet shaving.\n\n**Post:** The neutron bomb of post shaves. It makes an icy desert of your face and calls it peace. Tacitus would love it! As for me, my face is still throbbingly cold three hours after use. It makes summer go away for a little bit. Initial application feels like severe windburn, but the comfortable numbness comes along about five minutes in and lingers for hours.\n\n**Frag:** Some of the most creative reviews on Basenotes are for this controversial scent.\n\n[http://www.basenotes.net/fragrancereviews/fragrance/26121418](http://www.basenotes.net/fragrancereviews/fragrance/26121418)\n\n\"An electrical fire in a mausoleum\". \"An unbathed old woman soaked in gasoline\". The bottle is stunning, and the scent? Actually, I find it very comfortable. The Basenotes lads may not be familiar with Fougere Gothique and Night Music, but if y'all have smelled these and like 'em, Dali PH presents no real challenge.\n\nSharp citrus opening? Check. Indolic (poo-like) florals? Check. Smoky notes? Check. Lots of musk? Check. The only real addition here, outside of the unholy fusion of Night Music and FG, is a bit of synthetic castoreum for a powdery animalic note.\n\nSo to the average non-wet shaving dude, this frag smells like all the scents one might hate and fear, like a Batman movie with The Joker, The Riddler, Catwoman, and the Penguin all in it, or like those Japanese giant monster festival flicks. But to wet shavers who use a lot of B&M? More like Catwoman by herself in lingerie!",

Sometimes it be like that.\n\nFresca Intensa is a citrusy punch yo mama fragrance that is so good for a summer morning shave. Every thing is great. Storybook Soapworks Base is great and the APR post shave has left me rubbing my own face to enjoy the smoothness. I applied the EdT with a garden hose to test the claim that it will be enjoyed three cubicles over. So far I've received two compliments at the office so job done.\n\nI'd like to take a second to thank Maggards for their customer service. I had a minor shipping issue that was just normal stuff that can happen. I shot them a message and got a quick response making it right. It's good to know I can spend my kid's college funds and have the confidence the vendor is there to back their services.",

Decent shave, but I can feel it getting a touch rough on the ATG already.\n\nSpaced putting on the Olay I normally use after the aftershave dries, today is going to get uncomfortable towards the afternoon.

The scent on this soap is supposed to replicate sprint in Gates of the Artic national park. When you open the jar the first scent that hits you is the grass. At first this seems a little overwhelming but as I lathered the soap it started to smell very clean, you could pick up some aquatic and floral scents. It really just smells very clean. There was a very slight cooling sensation as well. As far as performance goes, it was great. Right up there with B&M, lots of residual slickness and cushion. The soap lathered pretty easily and needed just a little bit more water than I normally use. I did my usual 3 pass shave and its definitely BBS. The aftershave soothed my skin and the scent has some staying power. Its not strong but definitely stays for awhile. Great product overall and I am glad I have gotten a chance to add it to my collection.",

Often when I think of elite vegan bases I think of SW and I think of CB. I should remember that Wholly Kaw's vegan base is also fan-frikkin'-tastic. Hayfever season has died down sufficiently that the mentholation in Fern Concerto no longer makes my eyes water. It's not a patch on the cooling power of Terror, but it is very pleasant nonetheless and it doesn't have the feedback-damping, face-numbing effect of Terror. A most awesome shave to start the weekend.",

Enter Seville and damn does it still scratch that itch I didn't know I had. As soon as Will releases the aftershave in Deltus, I'll set my sights at killing this set next. In the meantime, today's shave was still pretty damn wonderful. I always enjoyed Glissant and today was no exception. Easily dialed in and gives me the slickness and cushion I've come to expect. I'll be picking more figs soon so it's time to get some coffee in me. Happy Saturday folks!",

It was funny that it came up because I had just ordered some more of their stuff to try. I hadn't used Durga's Companion since my Desert Island Shave during the games so I got it out today. This scent is lemongrass grapefruit and is quite strong. The soap is a vegan base and is fatty and super slick. It's a really good shave and I always enjoy it. I bought a few tubs of their other stuff to try and to share. I'll most likely end up sampling them out to folks that are interested.\n\nI had two packages that were delivered to my office go missing. One was the new Talbot set and one had a King of Oud set. They were signed for by the mail room lady and then somehow got lost. I'm pretty bummed about that. Hopefully they are sitting in the wrong place somewhere and eventually find their way home. I'm losing hope after two weeks though.",

There is some conflicting information regarding its scent on TryThatSoap - the [listed notes](https://trythatsoap.com/collection/1195/?product_type=soap) do not match [the product literature.](https://www.stirlingsoap.com/products/varen-shave-soap) Waiting for clarification on them from /u/urfrendlipiro and /u/StirlingSoap to find out which is correct. (I'm guessing it's the product literature because this does not smell like the bouquet of flowers described in the TTS entry?)\n\n**Going by first impressions,** Varen is earthy and green, mossy and woodsy. It's a bit soapy and astringent before it's lathered up (though less than Reserve Fern) and you still get hints of this in brief flashes during the shave. Mostly, though, I get a very green fern with plenty of oakmoss and hints of grassy vetiver and woody cedar. The lavender and geranium don't stand out as florals and the sage is thankfully a support note rather than in the foreground. I find it one of the ferniest ferns that ever did fern out of the 170+ products that I have tried so far this year *holy fuck what is wrong with me.* It's a perfect example of a straight-forward fougère insofar as it smells like a damp, herbaceous forest [(the idea that inspired the fern genre in the first place)](https://old.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/c6hmlo/friday_lather_games_sotd_thread_jun_28_2019/es8z5r0/) *and I bet this would smell **extra foresty** super-lathered with [Coniferous.](https://trythatsoap.com/collection/93/?product_type=soap)** Maybe I'll try that tomorrow.\n\nEvery once in a while (and rather a lot lately) I entertain the idea of tinkering around with some crude perfumery in my basement, of trying to craft my own simple fragrances to fill the few holes that I can't seem to fill with commercial products in my collection. Every time I come up with an idea for a fragrance I sit down and record my ideas in detail, then come back to them later with a fresh mind and ask myself: does this already exist? Could I just buy it and save myself the trouble? Most of the time the answer ends up being Yes and this is one of those times: Varen ended up being one of those idea killers, fitting perfectly into one of the empty slots on my olfactory shelf. Well done, Stirling!\n\n(Edit: went back and hand-lathered it again just because I enjoyed my shave so much. Updated thoughts based on further testing.)\n\n**Fragrance Thoughts:**\n\nToday's fragrance is a summer flanker to [the original ApH.](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Azzaro/Azzaro-pour-Homme-829.html) While the original is extremely aromatic and borderline overwhelming, the LE2015 flanker has a lovely opening of juicy citrus, floral lavender, and Chinese Grocery Store spices. After that it gets sort of woody / spicy / mossy / ambery and lasts for a really long time, albeit with much milder sillage and projection than the original (as is necessary in summer heat). Some time I need to do a back-to-back shootout with my five ApH variations for alls y'alls, but the reason I'm wearing it today is that the last time I wore it the orange-lavender opening made me go \"oh! this reminds me of the citrus & lavender at the start of Dolce&Gabbana, only Better,\" so logically they needed to be worn sequentially to test if my impression was correct!\n\nGranted, one has to acknowledge that *many* citrus & lavender accords are going to smell similar in some way, but that's sort of what this perfume adventure is about: when I discover that I have multiple fragrances in my collection with eerily similar aspects, I freak out because I start to worry that I'm wasting my money and buying too much of the same thing... and 7 of my 8 fougères in this leg of the journey suffer that precise problem: openings built around citrus, lavender, and aromatics/spices. (If we were talking girls, it would seem that I \"have a type.\") Different citruses? Yes. Different spices? Yes. All variations on a similar theme, and it's my task this week to sort out which of those variations make me go \"mmmmmmm\" and which ones make me go \"ewwwwww.\"\n\n(Edit: Yeah, my recollection of this perfume was only about 80% correct. I'll clear things up in my roundup post next Friday.)",

I had to try her out today. What an awesome razor. I think it even exceeds my US aristocrat as my favorite vintage.\n\nThese Square Root by Pascal knots continue to be every bit as good as the Manchurians you see for sale such as atTDR and Maggard. Not up to Elite Razor Manchurian level but this point I don't think anyone's going to match those. But at $30 per knot, the price is incredible.",

Taking a break from the Nacet, as I'll be using it for all of August. Also means I can break out a different razor.\n\nTrying out a vintage Tungsten blade that a generous viewer sent me. It performed as well as the very good blades of the modern era. Fun to try. I am especially going to watch this blade as it performs over time.\n\nAlso trying the B5 for a final time at this loft before I remove an o-ring.\n\n#### ❧ Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Wolfman - WR1 Solid Bar .54 Brushed ::: Personna - 74 - Tungsten ‹1 uses›)*\n\nA sweet smooth shave! Was also a close cut.\n\nNo tugging or irritation.\n\n#### ❧ Soap Notes\n*^(Declaration Grooming Icarus - Admiral)*\n\nThem: \"Named after and inspired by the famous riverboat that spent many years patrolling the shores of the Mississippi River and was one of the art deco icons of 20th century Saint Louis. This is a sweet breeze on a summer day patrolling the banks by Laclede's Landing. \"\n\nNotes: Lemongrass, verbena, bergamot, aquatic notes, sage, black currant bud, riverboat smoke, tonka bean, musk\n\nScent: I'll first say that I'm glad I ordered this scent just based on the notes. I really like it. But I don't get \"breeze\" from it at all. IMO, it's too warm and almost thick-spicy. The aquatic notes are also so muted (had to really reach to find them) that I wouldn't say that it was \"an aquatic for people who don't like aquatics\" because I would not consider it an aquatic in the first place.\n\nFor me, the tonka bean was the strongest, which I don't like all that much, but hawns fixed it by throwing in the musk, smoke and maybe the black currant ... which transformed the tonka into something very interesting. After the tonka-spice-smoke medley, the citrus is there, but not too distinctive. Just adding some support.... but I'm sure I would miss it if it wasn't there.\n\nI smell very little sage, which is fine with me.\n\nWhile I could wear this all year, it seems to be drawing me to the fall/winter where it would really shine.\n\nIt may not match the some of the text description/story regarding the scent, at least according to my nose, but I'm still a huge fan of this scent, and thoroughly enjoyed taking whiffs of myself both during, and for 20 mins or so after, the shave.\n\nScent Strength: 4/10, lightly present during shaving.\n\nLather: super slick, not that creamy-thick, but still a delight to use. Maybe I would not want to go any wetter than this.\n\n* 30 sec load with lightly wet badger\n* 1.5 tsp water to build lather\n* = 3 passes\n\nBowl - I used the XL version of this bowl:\nhttps://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3392930\n\n#### ❧ Brush Notes\n*^(Declaration Grooming - B5 24mm Badger Blue Handle‹7 uses›)*\n\nSame as last time, it didn't splay very much. A lovely wall of soft badger, but I'd like a bit less backbone. So I'm going to remove one of two o-rings and see what happens next time.\n\n----\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Smooth\n*Neck*: Smooth\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Cut flush to where I just see the tips (above average for me)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm) *and also in the sub's sidebar.*\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

Trying to break in my travel brush before a trip in a few weeks. Using a collapsible dog bowl for a portable lather bowl. The set up works pretty well! I think I failed to dial in the lather. I usually get really good cushion, but not enough slickness. I've been playing around with the water amount to try and get it closer to perfect. Third shave with the Feather blade had my face all sorts of irritated with small nicks. Can't blame the blade for everything. I'm sure my technique had something to do with it as well. Oh well. Until tomorrow.",

I grew out a vacation beard and was itching (literally) to shave it off when I got home yesterday. The maggard slant made incredibly fast work through the beard. It was like a hot knife through butter.\n\nI had 3 packages waiting for me when I got home from vacation. One of which contained this awesome set. Sweet lemon is an amazing scent, and Icarus is my favorite soap base. Just super easy going. I also used a dec splash for the first time ever. Man, this shit is incredible. If you've never used this splash, you should strongly considering trying it out. My face feels absolutely incredible.\n\nHappy weekend everyone!",

Most aquatic scents are artificial and headache-inducing for me, but not this one. It has beautiful warmth, a bit of sweetness, and a wisp of smoke. I imagine this will have pretty much universal appeal.\n\n\nAnother friend is looking to sell one of his favorite brushes, this Morris & Forndran 2xl. I'd heard the knot quality can vary, but he assured me this was comparable to Declaration, and offered to let me try it. Hand-tied by Lee Sabini, the density is fantastic, with beautifully soft tips and nice backbone. My first experience with M&F and it was excellent. I can see why the pre-Sears brushes like this one are so desirable. Not sure what \"Blonde Badger\" means, but I checked the M&F website and it says that kind of knot is scarce and not readily available. I might have to add this one to my badger farm, we'll see.\n\n\nMy Gillette NEW refinished by Delta Echo still looks brand new, too bad they're no longer in the business. I'm seeing good things from Sherlock, so hopefully they'll do well and we will have a reputable source for coated razors again.\n\n\nHope your shave is a good one today!",

Triumph is inspired by Invictus. I've never smelled the real thing but the soap smells quite nice and is pretty strong which I like. I somehow screwed up the Lather a little bit but it wasn't too bad. I'm just coming off of a two week Stirling binge so I should have known better. I think I tried to take it too far in the bowl. Gonna be a bunch of household chores today. Hopefully I'll get some time to play with some vintage brushes that have been waiting patiently for me. Hope you guys are having a good weekend.",

I chose this base because I had such a great shave the last time I used it. It's seriously underrated in my opinion. The lather is dense, and it's hard to wash off. That's the sign of my favorite kind of lather. So nice to get rid of the itchy stubble. My face feels amazing. Happy Sunday to everyone.",

Really enjoyed everything about it. I have been using a vintage Gillette super stainless blade and it's smooth as silk. Three head shaves and four face shaves in it and It's still as sharp and smooth as day one\n\nFirst Grooming Depot soap. I have used it twice I'm very impressed. Still need to use it more but I can see this being a top base for me. Frankinlime smells great. And it's girlfriend approved. I ordered the splash from Maol grooming and it will be here Monday.\n\nEverything about the Grizzly Bay brush makes me happy good size for lathering my face and head. It makes great lather and doesn't hog it. Good back bone and splay. Comfortable handle. Ticks all the boxes. I need more fanchurian in my life.",

I tried 2/3 Varen and 1/3 Coniferous but I think I should have gone the other way: it was mossy and earthy with just a hint of forest, where I was thinking more like a forest with a good undercurrent of earthy moss. Still fun though, and I smell super green and mossy now after following it up with some powdery green Skin Bracer.\n\nToday's fragrance is *another* summer flanker to [the original ApH](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Azzaro/Azzaro-pour-Homme-829.html), this time an attempt to re-imagine it as an aquatic... bizarre. Anyway, if you took the original ApH and somehow split its creamy-soapy-aromatic-spicy-woody fougère personality down the middle, ApH2015 would be the woody-aromatic-spicy half and L'Eau would be the soapy-creamy half.\n\nWhen you look at the notes list for L'Eau it looks like a pretty conventional \"shaving cream fougère,\" except there's no hint of powder or oakmoss anywhere in its DNA. Powder would be the opposite of their aquatic goal, so it's banished from this perfume's otherwise barbershop DNA. L'Eau is built around the traditional lavender-coumarin fern accord (albeit a quiet one) and embellished with tart, tangy citrus top notes, warm floral geranium to make the heart smooth and creamy (and allegedly calone, but it must be blended and balanced pretty well because I can't detect any standing out), and a creamy-woody base of sandalwood and musk with patchouli and vetiver in the background. If anything, it would remind me of Brut minus its powder (can you guess what I'll be wearing tomorrow?) but with an Azzaro twist: as with all ApH flankers, its opening includes a bit of the bitter / aromatic / astringent quality of the pillar fragrance, and as usual those notes are omitted from the marketed list of scent notes.",

I had like $5 credit on my acct there still and the 40 blade sampler was 5.99 so for a buck it was a no brainer. After switching from my 'bigfoot shaves' blades (which I am thinking are a rebranded Baili product as the razor was as well) I noticed that the slight tugging went away when shaving my neck. I was all ready to go for a new razor but it turned out I just needed a different blade. Still stuck on the Arkadia soap, maybe one day I'll get to try the Gatlinburg I have here lol.",

I've been wanting this set since it's release and finally got my hands on one. It's exactly what I hoped for. I've been missing that sweet cherry almond scent in my den, and couple it with leather was a fantastic idea.\n\nIn other news, this Semogue 2000 knot is breaking in beautifully. I think this was the 7th or 8th use and id say it's about 85% broken in, I can feel just a few holdout thick hairs that haven't split yet. Setting it a bit lower than how it comes out of the factory was definitely the right choice too. It splays wonderfully but doesn't dry like a wild mane like most Semogue tend to do.\n\nI didn't spray on more fenchurch, but I can still smell it from last night's shave. \"but wait Tonality, you didn't shower before shaving? Or since last night?\"\n\nNo, don't judge me, it's Sunday and I'm sitting around watching baseball and not leaving the house. So sue me.",

With Austere August coming up quickly, it's time to get in some shaves with some fun/favorite soaps and razors before I have to lock into my one setup.\n\nthis time, I'm also experimenting with the brush by taking off an o-ring to see if I like that splay. (I did)\n\n#### ❧ Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Karve - Christopher Bradley OC C Plate ::: Feather ‹36 uses›)*\n\nMoving to a more aggressive razor for the 35 use Feather. CB handled it really well, giving a smooth, comfortable shave.... that turned out to need no touch-ups and was very close cut.\n\nNo tugging or irritation.\n\n#### ❧ Soap Notes\n*^(Cella - Crema Sapone)*\n\nScent: That cherry/almond/marzipan scent that's been on Cella forever.\n\nScent Strength: was light and about 3-4/10 for strength. Lightly present during shave.\n\nLather: a little creamy , but nice and slick! Very nice.\n\nThis time, I did remember -- thanks to the notes -- that Cella likes to be a little drier than my usual high-elastic standard.\n\n* 30 sec load in the tub with a lightly-wet big dense badger\n* 2.5 tsp water added to build the lather\n* = 5 passes of lather\n\n\n\nBowl - I used the XL version of this bowl:\nhttps://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3392930\n\n#### ❧ Brush Notes\n*^(Declaration Grooming - B5 24mm Badger Blue Handle‹8 uses›)*\n\nYep. took the one o-ring off, leaving one left, and that opened up the knot's splay just enough for me to enjoy today's shave really well. It looks like this is the Goldilocks loft for this B5 knot and me.\n\n----\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Smooth\n*Neck*: Smooth\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Cut flush to where I just see the tips (above average for me)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm) *and also in the sub's sidebar.*\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

During the shave everything seemed great, hair was coming off easily. This was my first time trying plate 2 on the Rockwell and it was amazingly comfortable, felt like I almost couldn't hurt myself. Thought I was getting a damn near BBS shave, but then when I put on the alum and splash it was made abundantly clear to me that I f***** up. This happens from time to time to me, hence my post in the daily questions thread about blade angle. Still refining my technique to make things as perfect as possible",

However, during the shave, it did not shed a single hair so I was surprised. The razor + blade worked well and gave me a smooth and efficient shave. Mild post shave to wrap up the shave.\n\nWhew. What a trip. I was gone for two weeks and I had to do a BBS everyday. As expected, I did get irritation throughout those two weeks, using a VDH razor, Maggard synthetic, and Personna Lab blue blades. It still did the job and I enjoyed those travel shaves. From here, I'll be getting back on the SOTD and trying out all the gears that I have in my den. As for new gears, I have my eye on couple of the IB razors, i.e. Lupo / baby smooth / etcs. Perhaps later down the year, I'll get those.",

I got a little bit of sunburn! But after a long day, I decided I need to shower and shave. I've been working on my lather technique, and today was the best day yet. Great lather and BBS after 4 passes. WTG, ATG, XTG, XTG. I tried to do the two XTGs at a slight diagonal and it seems to have helped.\n\nEven before taking a pass, the lather burned my face a little bit. I think it is because of my sunburn, and the brush lathering in my face irritated it a bit. None the less, great shave.\n\nI don't have my post shave stuff with me so I just used lotion. Not as good as the normal routine. Further reinforces my desire to find an affordable daily driver post shave balm.",

First time trying the Polish vintage Wizamet Polsilver blades. Great blade!\n\nIt's also the first time I have killed a full tub of artisan shave soap. I had to constantly add water to the brush for it to pick up the remaining bits of soap on the sides of the jar. So I accidentally ended up building the lather in the jar as if it was a lathering bowl. Lol.",

B8 seems to have A good amount of backbone, but the hair is soft. Rumor has it that it takes about 10 uses to really break it in. I enjoyed it a lot already, so we'll see how it changes.\n\nParadise Frost is such a great soap. Other than TOBS grapefruit, which has a base that is basically unusable to me, this is probably the best grapefruit soap around. Wonderful for the summer, with just a touch of menthol. Fantastic soap.",

It has been too long since I have killed anything. So, I'll be working on this puck often in the coming weeks to kill it off. After I used this dried out puck over the weekend, I put some water in the mug to soften it up. This is the ONLY soap I bloom...ever. It is pretty well hydrated now and doesn't take a lot of effort to load and lather.\n\nI have been through more pucks of WMS than any other brand. But that was before I discovered shaving forums. I can't believe this was my one and only now that I have a plethora of top quality options.",

For instance, a lot of people reported smelling all sorts of gourmand notes with Grecian Horse. All I got was a very distinct cologne scent that would not go away all day long. Forbidden Fruit seems to be a nice combination of cologne and fruit. It definitely has depth but there is a very distinct sweetness in which the fruit notes are more prominent. For me that's a plus but I can see other is finding this too fruity.\n\nTwo good shaves with the Treet black. I'll consider 4 a win so I'm halfway there.",

I gotta agree, it's an excellent razor. I've been hesitant to try one, I honestly thought I was not a fan of their design, but holding one in person looks much better than I anticipated. I think if I were to get one, I would want stainless though.\n\nExtremely smooth shave today, the wonderful Storybook base and B8 brush certainly played their part.

First off the replating is GORGEOUS and I feel really lucky to have gotten this razor from Back Roads Gold. It's a matte nickel and I love it.\n\nMoved my current blade over from the ball end tech I've been using to get a clean comparison. Fatty definitely does better in my hands and the shave was just like with the regular tech as far as I can tell so super happy with it. I have a post war fatty coming tomorrow and an curious to see if I can tell a difference.\n\nI'm starting to realize that I don't have the technique down to push a blade all the way through AA on Ultra Nightmare. I will probably go for a lower difficulty- I've got a bunch of important stuff to lead at the end of the month and am going to want muh fresh blades",

Sweet, lemony, powdery rose. My nose didn't pick up almost anything else that *that's fine with me* because this is my favorite rosey soap so far. Paired up with the minty powdery Skin Bracer at the end made for an intoxicating aroma while I prepared breakfast.\n\nFollowing yesterday's Brut is Other Brut. They're made by two different companies using the same list of ingredients, but the note balance is ~~apparently quite~~ definitely different: the plastic version from the drug store is more mossy, powdery, and aromatic, while the glass version from a perfume store has a bit less Anise and a stronger and muuuch longer lasting lemon note; in fact the citrus-lavender mix in this one shares a certain resemblance to the Floïd Blue fragrance family in a refreshingly nose-clearing way.",

I ended up moving up a plate to the B SB and the blade felt much better. I'm still planning to use a fresh blade for AA but will set this one aside to use afterwards. I'm curious to see how much further it can go, especially with a slightly more aggressive set up.",

Man, I love this soap base.\n\n#### ❧ Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Gillette - Aristocrat 16 - UK ::: Gillette - Platinum ‹12 uses›)*\n\nA smooth shave, while still being efficient. I love the feel of this razor, and this blade works with it so well, for my skin at least.\n\nNo tugging or irritation.\n\n#### ❧ Soap Notes\n*^(Fine Accoutrements - Santal Absolut)*\n\nOne of my favorite scents ever. Sandalwood, but with some kind of musk or bitter wood or something. It's an awesome woodiness that just resonates with me.\n\nScent Strength: 5/10, making it nicely available and enjoyable during the shave.\n\nLather: This puck gives me such great lather very easily. Great creamy feel and super slick. Rival any top-tier soap, IMO... seriously.\n\n* Soaked the soap in some water for several minutes while I prepped my gear, then, before loading, I poured maybe a tsp of that water into lather bowl\n* 30 sec load with a soft badger\n* 3.5 tsp of water added to make the lather.\n* = 6-7 passes of lather\n\n\nBowl - I used the XL version of this bowl:\nhttps://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3392930\n\n#### ❧ Brush Notes\n*^(Golden Nib - Silvertip Premium 22mm‹27 uses›)*\n\nComparing this TGN knot to the Thater I used recently. At first, the Thater seemed softer, and I do think it probably is, but then the TGN maybe got wetter during the shave and started to feel as soft as I remember. Thater may still win by a little in the softness category, but ... it's just so small.\n\n----\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Smooth\n*Neck*: Smooth\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Many hairs show whisker tips with a little length to them\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm) *and also in the sub's sidebar.*\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

Super easy shave with great lather from Catie's Bubbles. Alllmost at the end of the tub... not sure how many shaves left, but I'm scraping soap off the sides and mashing it into the middle to avoid the ring of death... otherwise I'm finding it difficult to load the brush properly. Seems to be working as I got a good amount of soap in my badger brush today.\n\nThe sun has now come out! Have a wonderful Tuesday, everyone. :)",

I was a bit unsure from the sample on the first sniff, it was quite bitter not like anything I'd smelt before. The more I sniffed it the more I like it, the Cedrat smells great, its a scent I really like which isn't used in many soaps I've found, in fact the L'Occitane balm is the only other product I've found. I told myself I was done soap buying for a while, but I'm seriously considering picking up a tub of this.\n\nThe lather was great and overall a really good shave.\n\nDebating whether to join in Austere August, I really like variety.

B8 seems to have a break in period from what I understand. I'm excited to see how it changes in 10 or so uses. It's already pretty soft, but it's still eating lather a bit.",

This is a safer scent imo than some of the others that have come from CL lately, but that's in no way a bad thing imo. It's got this delightful smoky accord behind a fresher aquatic goodness with the faintest hint of lemony greenness (lemongrass maybe?) out in front. Should be a crowd pleaser and I definitely wanted to visit this idea before a month of the Stag. This is wonderful and I'm glad I've got the full set to play with for time to come!",

I happen to enjoy Bison base and there's certainly nothing wrong with pine, lavender, and cedar as a scent, so this was a lovely tub of soap to receive.

Scrubbed a little too hard today.\n\nAlso: today marks two straight months of shaving every single day. At this time last year I was shaving only on dates divisible by 5. Thank you, fellow shave nerds, for learnin' me up right proper for how to shave real good like. I look marginally more professional at work now and that helps me feel good.\n\nToday's frag is PRPH, a bitter, soapy, mossy aromatic fougère. Ain't no citrus or anything fun to make the opening sparkling and cheerful - just sharp rosemary, sage, and rosewood up top. They're downright harsh if you spray it too heavy and they take a long time to mellow out and settle into the barbershoppy lavender-coumarin-geranium heart, and they really don't completely vanish until you're at the base drydown with its oakmoss, musk, and amber. People keep telling me there's honey in here too but I haven't noticed it yet and trust me, I been lookin.\n\nAnyway, the overall impression is a much more mature, classy, professional-smelling mossy fougère than the Brut or APH L'Eau I wore earlier this week. Still in that sort of soapy, shaving creamy smell family, but very serious compared to the other ones.",

Plus...I really like fresh blades J\n\nMy collection is pretty small as it as, so I think I'm going to opt out this year (hey I've got a LITTLE less than a day to decide) and just take care of myself.

Instead, Id call it very interesting and I can't deny it's very well done. I think the splash would be a bit much for me but the soap is a winner.\n\nI like trying European and random aftershaves. Myrsol has a nice line. I was attracted to Metisol because it stated that it included alum so I was curious if it would be overly drying like a block would be. I actually found it to be very soothing and didn't dry me out. I only added the Proraso for a bit of extra moisture. Definitely seems to be another winner from them.",

I've used the Icarus base many times but both offerings are fantastic. This was delivered on a 95 degree day so it softened a little before I got home. Threw it in the fridge and it hardened up but it was soft when I went to use it again today so I way overloaded. Will have to come back to this again soon when it's not so soft.",

I just got the B OC plate in and I am thoroughly impressed. Its more efficient than the A but with the same blade feel. Vide Poche is a great scent. This shave made me seek out the matching splash which i landed.\n\nI used the SHD to compare to the B8, and it just reinforced how great of a value this brush is. Seriously, its impressive how good this brush is.\n\nHump daaaay",

Had to recover the lather by basically face-lathering. Trying another MLS soap from the huge box I bought a while back.\n\n#### ❧ Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Karve - Christopher Bradley OC C Plate ::: Feather ‹37 uses›)*\n\nExcellent shave. Very comfy and a great, close cut.\n\nNo tugging or irritation.\n\n#### ❧ Soap Notes\n*^(Mickey Lee Soapworks - La Belle du Sud)*\n\nThem: \"Peach, Lavender, Pistachio\"\n\nScent: Man, I loved how the peach was forefront, but wasn't a plain or typical peach, because ... probably... of the lavender. I really enjoyed the scent, because I'm a Southern boy. The Lav wasn't really easy to pull out on it's own. Seems to have gotten absorbed into the peach, but for good reason: to form an excellent and unique peach-variant that will have me coming back.\n\nPistachio? Nah, couldn't really find it this time. Maybe hunt again later.\n\nScent Strength: Tentative score: 3-4/10, lightly present during shaving.\n\nLather: Nice lather, slick and creamy.\n\nNo metrics on this one. Lather too wet due to not enough soap gathered up at first load. So Just loaded from the tub before each pass for a few seconds. With the wet lather from the bowl already there, this would cream up nicely for a good feel.\n\n\nBowl - I used the XL version of this bowl:\nhttps://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3392930\n\n#### ❧ Brush Notes\n*^(Whipped Dog - Boar 30mm‹4 uses›)*\n\nFeels good on the face. Happy with it. But in part of the shave, it wouldn't stay in splay. Well, that was because the lather was too thin. It shifted fine into splay once the lather was fixed. Knot looks so vertical and straight when so young. Can't wait for it to bloom more.\n\n----\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Cut flush to where I just see the tips (above average for me)\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm) *and also in the sub's sidebar.*\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

The soap has arrived and honestly smells like jello. This will be quite the month of shaving. The aftershave should be out for delivery today. I'll clean my brushes, Razors, and set out a fresh blade to start off Austere August on the right foot.\n\nAnyway, hope everyone has a wonderful day!",

I am so impressed with their soaps. They have a vegan base and strong straightforward fragrances. Their soaps perform really well. Jötun is a mentholated soap scented with fir, tangerine, and cedar. The lather is quite shiny and very slick. It's easy to work with and the post shave is fantastic. I got a very close, very comfortable shave. A Southern Witchcrafts Tres Matres Splash has my skin feeling amazing right now. I don't know what up with the company. They don't have much of a social media presence and some of their stuff is out of stock. I scooped out a handful of samples that will be part of some PIF's in August.\n\nOne thing I learned during the Lather Games is that doing something every day for a month really improves that thing. I set a goal to use a Shavette every day in July and I only missed one day. My technique has really improved and it's really fun now. I'll be continuing by setting some new daily goals each month. Both shaving and non shaving related. For those of you participating in Austere August, I'm looking forward to seeing how it all goes.",

Not even close to be as cold as Terror, the other mentholated soap I have, but way more refreshing. You don't start feeling the cold until you are half way through the lathering but, when it finally kicks in and mixed with the lime and minty scent, it provides an inigualable refreshing sensation.\nTo make things better, if that is even possible, Frankinlime takes you to refreshing heaven.\n\nTrying a fresh Polsilver blade with the Wolfman felt like they belong together. The shave was so smooth that it doesn't feel like I shaved the last 3 days in a row. With shaves like this one I don't mind being a daily shaver.\n\nI'm going to Las Vegas next week to celebrate my wife's birthday. I think this will be the setup I'll be using there.",

I only have the EdT sample, but I am strongly considering buying the full EdT. In fact, I almost definitely will. It's a complex affair with a beautifully blended amount of smoke, citrus, and earth notes. I got a lot of the citrus on the immediate application, and it's grown since then to smell like a riverbank in the woods. The aquatic notes do not dominate, as has been touched on by everyone who has reviewed Admiral, but that's probably pretty accurate of a river vs the ocean IMO. Plus, I hate traditional aquatics, so this is right up my alley.\n\nAdmiral might be my favorite scent since Lamplight Penance. It's definitely in my absolute top-tier of new scents this year.\n\nGreat performance across the board--I got a great shave today. I'm not sure if I'm just noticing it more or what, but with the last couple of Chatty Lux scents I've gotten in the Icarus soap base I've been smelling the base a lot more. That isn't the end of the world, but I do get a certain sweetness from the soap that I don't get from the splash and fragrance. I noticed the same thing with Taum Sauk recently (in fact, it was much more apparent in Taum Sauk, probably because of the less dominant notes than Admiral's smoke, tonka bean, etc.). I may have to revisit some of my older collaborations to see if it's been there all along or not.",

Plus, I really wanted to try the sample of Orbit I picked up at Maggard's the other day.\n\nI have had trouble lathering Noble Otter in the past, and today was not much better. This time I blame inexperience with using samples. I scooped some into a bowl and then tried to load the brush. Didn't feel like l loaded enough so added a bit more. First face lather was a bit dry, but shaved perfectly fine. Next two passes also went very good. Orbit had a very nice cooling effect which I enjoy after a day at the beach. Another near BBS shave. I think I'll have to add Orbit to the stable, assuming I can get my hands on it.",

Tradere razors have been very difficult to acquire since they've been long out of production. After having tried the v2 Safety Bar version years ago, I was on a mission to find this v1 OC. I was looking for a reasonable one for years, and pretty much gave up. Of course when I least expect it (a week after I spent a grip on another razor) someone came out of nowhere and offered one to me. Now this was a pretty penny, but a top notch, if not possibly the best specimen I could have come across. This razor is like BRAND NEW, the original owner only shaved with it a few times, and it shows, the finish is flawless! And bonus cup happiness, it also happened to have the original case, that only came with the first 100ish razors. The serial number is low, too...HELL YEAH!!!! Here it is folks, the OG machined stainless razor in all its glory, including the original [larger] handle sitting on the sideline while the v2 handle gets some game time.\n\nWhen I was presented this razor for purchase, I was at the end of a sort of razor binge...I kept finding rare and awesome razors I wanted to try, so I bought them. This meant I never really gave this one much of a test drive. I used it one time, and noticed the sides of the razor don't lend themselves well to shaping facial hair (I still have my Creeper 'stache), so I put it on the sidelines for a good 6 or so months. Well, today was the day to get back to it.\n\nThe head of this v1 is substantially larger than the v2 design. Also, the handle is larger. It's almost like it's a 125% scale version lol.\n\nThe thing I disliked about the v2 SB I used before, was it was TOO mild, like it felt like I was just wiping a razor on my face with no blade. The down side is it didn't shave too close for me, so that's when I decided to try to find a v1. the first iteration is MUCH more aggy, and has a good amount of blade feel to boot, so not for everyone. I still need to give this razor some time before I have a solid opinion, but so far I love it! I need to get the angle down, and the balance is a little strange since my other favorites are typically Ti, and more streamlined head design. All of this given, it's a great addition to my stable, and it's a fun razor to use.\n\nDFS shave today, I have to work on the angle a bit, and see how it fares with more shaves on the blade, but still totally DFS.\n\nHappy Tuesday all!!!!",
