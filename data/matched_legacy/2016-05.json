Yeah, it's Senior Week so there's functions to attend but I don't have to be anywhere until Commencement, and then nowhere else until I travel to the South Caucuses in a week. This means I can finally try some stuff I've been wanted to try without worrying about having to get clean shaven and out the door in the morning.\n\nA month or so ago I went to a slowly closing antique shop and found a Gillette NEW long comb and a Ball End Tech (A1). Been meaning to try them but haven't had time for inefficient shaves. Today I decided to go with the NEW since I've been wanting to try this razor for awhile.\n\nIt wasn't a bad shave by any means. Honestly, the hardest part was readjusting to the DE technique. I liked the feel of the NEW in my hand, and the brass looks great. It took me 4 passes instead of the normal 3 I'm used to with SEs, but that could have been the fault of my technique more than anything else. Overall a nice razor. Not going to replace my SEs but lovely all the same.\n\nSince I'm motherfucking done it was time for motherfucking Roam and a double down with the motherfucking Koyvu. The Koyvu is strong, so much more pungent than the tonic. I didn't like it the first time I used it but, hell, it feel good on the face and if you want to smell like Roam this is the way to go. Fortunately this is my fiancée's favorite scent (\"You smell like food,\" she says), so what the hell.\n\nHope all the drama passes over. My best to all of you in the best damn online community on the Internet.\n\nEDIT: Hit send by mistake before I was done.\n\n",

The knot is set deep within the handle which lends to spectacular backbone for a synthetic. Not to mention the tips are smooth as buttah. If all my other brushes burnt up in a fire I'd not shed a tear, as I'd still have my 28mm Fauxmere. It really is that good. Many thanks to /u/ghostpoisonface for selling it to me.\n\nThanks to /u/chevro1et for the lovely sample of Cologne Russe. It performed flawlessly and smelled lovely. My last shave was with Seville, and between the two I can't really smell a huge difference. I'm sure there's some differences, but to the lay nose I have I couldn't detect a big difference. No matter, they both performed so well.\n\nSummer Storm was the splash of choice tonight due to the rains we're getting here in Seoul. And welcomed rains, they are. We need rain to wash all that dadblasted yellow dust off the trees, streets and cars. Before moving to Seoul I had never lived in a place where, at times, I could not open my windows for fear of getting my residence covered in a layer of dust. The yellow dust comes every spring, yet the microdust is always present. It sucks.\n\nIn vendor news I can confirm Folsom & Co. is kaput. A real shame too, since their splashes are/were so nice. I have only two of their splashes and dearly wish I had the rest. *sigh* So many kaput shaving companies this year...\n\nEdit: Apparently the news of Folsom & Co. is old. I just found out today.

There's no ingredients on the boxes but by smell and performance they seem to be tallow. Very nice stuff. They still have a little scent but it's mostly just that musty old tallow soap smell. Can't fault the performance, only took a tiny bit too get a nice cushioned slick lather going. The Romera knot continues to impress with its perfect balance of softness and backbone. Apparently I really enjoy barber handles, who'd have thought? I had initially planned on Muir, but as I finished the shave Floid Blue was calling so I went with that. Best of luck on this first May Monday everyone. My dad's 65th birthday would have been this Thursday (Cinco de Mayo) and though he's not with us any more, we're going to take my mom out to Mexican food just like we would have if he were.

Nice! Anywho, today's shave was my first go with Meißner Tremonia \"paste\" as they refer to it. Not a soap and not a cream. I am fortunate enough to live a couple miles from [SRD](http://www.straightrazordesigns.com/index.php?main_page=index&cPath=127_29&sort=20a&filter_id=151&alpha_filter_id=0) and I can drive Don crazy by opening all the jars and taking a whiff. The performance of this paste is right up there, but I think I would put CADE Rich and Baume Be ahead of it slightly for post shave feel. You do not get ripped off on scent strength from any MT soaps or paste. Damn good shave with a bit of tugging for some reason. This was only my third use on the RPL, so not sure what's up with that. Great Monday shaves to all ladies and gents.",

      "body": "SOTD Late Sunday Night Edition\n\n*What a difference a soap can make!*\n\n**Prep:** Shower, then cold water rinse\n\n**Lather:** Maggard's Lime and Bergamot\n\n**Brush:** Maggard's 24mm synthetic\n\n**Blade:** Personna Blue (3)\n\n**Razor:** ATT - R2 (colossus)\n\n**Post:** Additional soap\n\n**Fragrance:** Kyovu Original\n\nOk, Back to a great shave. Thank GOD.\n\nFriday morning's shave (my first with the R2 head) was amazing. Saturday night's shave was equally horrible. Wife asked me \"What happened to you?\" as I had 4-5 nicks/weepers, redness all over my neck. Same setup as Friday... only difference was the soap. So... Sunday night late... I decided to try again... same setup... but different soap. Got a nice smooth, mostly comfortable shave (I reopened a cut from Saturday and my neck hadn't fully recovered) --- as good as was possible I believe.\n\nSo the soaps that worked well were: *Soap Commander Courage* and *Maggard's Lime and Bergamot*. The other was a trial of another artisan soap... and the protection/glide just wasn't there. I think from now on I'll just start with Cella being a 9 on a 10 point scale (I love Cella's lather). If another soap isn't at least an 8 with great smell or other properties... it's not making the rotation.\n\nAnyway, have a great day all...",

I was kinda disappointed at L'Occitane\ncause there was no Baux or Cade Rich :( They did have Cedre & Oranger and Eau Du Verdon on sale, so I picked them both up for ~$53 since I wanted an aquatic frag anyway to go with some soaps (I don't have an aquatic aftershave yet)\nand my girlfriend really liked the Cedre & Orange. Win, win, win! Then I go back to check W_S to see whatever the fuck happened to it. I'm glad that this was made as a backup and that we're still doing SOTD threads (I hope!).\nI love being able to just reflect on my day as well as read what you all put as well :) Hopefully things get sorted out soon. Here's to Monday, I'm expecting to finally see if I get off the waitlist for Georgetown tomorrow (I hope..) since yesterday was the last day for applicants to hold multiple acceptances.\nHope this week goes well, I guess if anything, I have meetings scheduled this week with schools that rejected me to go over my app >__>\n\nBy the way, [**is this a crack in my slim?**](http://i.imgur.com/4GNLV33.jpg?1) I just noticed the gap under my baseplate today and am pretty bummed out about it since I only had it for like 2 months. Will it have any adverse effects on the integrity of the razor in the long term?\nIf so, how should I go about fixing it? :/ I hope it isn't anything major. The thing's a beaut and I wanna enjoy it for a while.",

I love Colonia di Agrumi. It's a great scent for all seasons. Performance and post shave are both stellar. Could be a contender in my desert island shave kit. Wish I had more of the splash, but when that day eventually comes at least Floid Blue pairs perfectly. :/\n\n\nHere is that LE brush from The Big Shave West u/chevro1et, along with a pic from Mr. Clark's FB with the handles. This is the second time I've used it and half the scritch is already gone. It's not even broken in yet and it's **really** good. Soft and fluffy. Stick tap (hockey version of head nod) to Nathan Clark's customer service. I wasn't able to attend the event due to a last minute change to a previous commitment, and I was really bummed. He kindly parted with his back up brush and shipped it 2.5 seconds after we shook internet hands. He's one of the nicest dudes in wet shaving.\n\n\nEdit: Anyone know where to pick up one of those neat Altoid travel tins? I've checked Etsy and a few other spots but I haven't found any for sale.",

Temperatures are struggling to get out of the low 40's, and it feels like anything but spring--an inauspicious start to May.\n\nThis is my first day without grading or classes in awhile. Sure, I have meetings this afternoon, but since I no longer have to look good in front of a classroom for a few months, I can broaden my horizons shave-wise. I've been pretty devoted to SE and injector shaving these past few months, but I recently picked up some DE razors from an antique shop I've been wanting to try. This week finally gives me that chance.\n\nToday I went with the Ball End Tech, date code A1. Even without this shave this is one beautiful razor. It's in near flawless condition, beautifully plated, with the Gillette diamond embossed on the top cap. The razor just feels good in your hand, too, perfectly weighted. This is a quality instrument.\n\nSadly, the shave didn't really do it for me. The razor is too mild. I had a hard time getting a clean shave, and this resulted in a fair bit of irritation (something I can also blame on my rusty DE technique, sure). The aftershave burnt like nothing else, and I can still feel a little stubble here and there.\n\nDespite not being a great shave, again, I loved this razor for its look and feel. It's one I'm happy to have in my collection even if it probably won't get used a lot.\n\nEDIT: Title & listen.",

Still, good shave, smells good and this brush is softening up a bit. I think I have been under loading my lather and slightly under watering it too. Gotta watch that. I hadn't shaved with an Astra green in months, I like many others, bought 100 from Amazon because they were the best sellers, so I've got a ton lying around. Normally they pull and tug, but today for whatever reason that blade just shaved perfectly smoothly, it was unsettling how smooth it was. I will be giving the Astra Green's another evaluation, perhaps with my improved lathering and technique they are performing better?",

The RazoRock Barber Pole 24mm synthetic. This is a great brush. Not too dense but it has a lot of backbone. It's similar to the Maggard knot but softer I think. I will need to get a few more shaves under my belt with it. But initial impressions are that this is a great brush.\nStill going through my blade sampler. Onto the Rapira Swedish Super Steel. This is an amazing blade. I thought the Voskhod was good but this is definitely surpassing it. Still going to try a few more before I bulk buy them. One more shave with this blade and then onto the next. Soap performed amazingly as always. That GIT splash is the business. Great stuff and a great shave. Have a great day all!!",

The Omega has been on shower duty forever, but since I'll be getting a new synthetic soon I thought I'd use it on the face today.With the shave stick I lathered it like I hated it. Granted the super lather made it easy, but wow was it ever easy. Used the wolf about a half dozen times now and got the feel down, super smooth.\n\n\nSpeick splash finished it off. Some of the other soaps are more interesting, but I will always have some Speick on hand!",

Was a bit more flexible on the adjustment going from 4 in most spots to 3 in some areas and it worked great.\n\nStarted cycling through brushes again for a bit, and the synthetic just blows the tits off my other 2 brushes. It whips up a superior lather in a shorter amount of time. Forgot to mention yesterday, but my best badger brush was hogging all the lather to the point where I had to reload even though I knew there was more hiding in there somewhere.",

But, I enjoyed it and got a super close shave.\n\nMy wife made an appointment with the movers so I need to start thinking about what I'm going to do for a few days when we move and get set up.

I purchased my Standard Razor via the Bespoke Post Barber Box, which is a superb deal. Unfortunately, that razor had very uneven blade gap. I emailed Standard Razor and they were going to send me a replacement head (that's all I asked for). Instead, they sent me an entire razor! So I now have two Standard Razors. The problem is I think both suffer from degrees of blade gap unevenness. While shaving one side felt buttery smooth then I could feel the blade very distinctly on the other side.\n\nI got some pretty good razor burn from it. When I slapped on the Cinnawood Boroka I actually had my breath taken away it was so *suddenly* painful. Thankfully, as we all know, the burn goes away very quickly. But that one second burn was very intense, indeed.\n\nI'll shave again with my Standard Razor, but I'll reseat the blade before doing so. If it still has a smooth side and a rough side after that I'll not use it again.\n\nEdit: I heard a terrible story from a wet shaving coworker today. When his mother was just maybe 4 or 5 years old she got hold of her father's safety razor. She fiddled with the razor for some time and eventually got the blade out. She was scared dad would find out so she fumbled and fumbled with the blade to get it back into the razor. She was unsuccessful in getting the blade back in, and by that time her fingers were a bloody mess. She made her way to her father and told him what happened. I am sure you can imagine the fright of her father at seeing his baby girl's bloody, chop suey hands. He rushed her to the hospital and all was well after lots of stitches.\n\nMake absolutely sure your loaded razors aren't even within the realm of possibility of being grabbed by your little monkey(s).",

It's one of the ones that sits in my medicine cabinet, so I tend to forget it's there.\n\nInteresting note, the scent of AdP blends very nicely with the sandalwood from my bath soap.",

Even though Signature was probably my favorite of the bunch, I liked them all and couldn't decide what to shave with today. I ended up flipping the samples over and picking one at random :p\n\nFrom my understanding, both Terre Du Dragon and Fine L'Orange Noir are inspired by Terre d'Hermes. Now, they're not identical to each other, but they definitely complement each other and pair nicely. Dapper Dragon soaps perform pretty damn well and I enjoy the scents, I just wish the strength was a little stronger (or that I wasn't always congested..). Either way, this is a great scent, and I'm glad Eric is thinking of making it (and Tiamat) a permanent addition :) I still don't know whether I'll buy a full tub or not, but I want to make a decision by the time I finish the sample (I'm pretty sure I'm gonna eventually buy a tub of Signature though; that shit's the tits).\n\nI didn't get a good lather this time cause I wanted to be lazy and didn't transfer the sample into a tupperware container (my dollar store ones are occupied). Instead, I tried scooping some out and smearing it in a bowl before loading. My Asian ass kept scooping out too little and my lather ended up being thin. I'm just gonna buy another fucking pack of tupperware lol.\n\nI bought the Maggard OC head because in the future, I want to be an owner of a Wolfman and don't know which head I'd want. Having never tried an OC head, Maggards seemed to be a very affordable way to try it out. Although my lather was pretty shit today, the head was really comfortable and had good weight to it; I may like it better than the V3, but I'll have to see again tomorrow. On another note, I think I've been too spoiled by my slim; I made a very shallow cut in my finger (no blood, just the top layer of skin) cause I'm not used to dealing with 3-piece razors anymore lol. Happy hump day everyone!\n",

After our friends took us to get some frozen custard at Caliches, this is the most amazing thing I've come across since wet shaving. I highly recommend the big Hawaiian.\n\nMonday we flew in and had dinner with /u/MrTooNiceGuy. This guy is true gentlemen, he bought me dinner and brought me a tub of Cade Rich he was planning to give away. Such a genuinely kind gesture took me by surprise and left me with my foot in my mouth. It was a perfect way to start my vacation knowing that there are such wonderful people out there. He has a child due any day now but I'm hoping to meet up again before our departure. If you folks are ever in the area, look him up and buy him some tequila because his genuine company is well worth it. Thank you!\n\nIf you can't make it I'll be sure to pay forward the kindness bud, I wish you all the best on the delivery of your son.\n\nI'm now going to take a nap, my head feel like a spilt log.",

I figured I may as well, they I can use them side by side personally, and see the difference. As you might guess, the fan got the majority of the attention. As not to leave out the bulb, I used it today. Since it didn't get as much attention from the get go, it broke in slowly. I think it has finally come to a point where it is much more comfortable to use than when it was new. I still prefer the fan =P\n\nAs for the 1912 Ever-Ready, I got a closer shave this time than last use, which was my first go with it. I like it a little more than last time, but I still prefer the 1924. I'll have to get back to the 1914 ER after I am done with this blade. While I definitely like the 1914, it was the first SE I ever used, so it was a little awkward to use. I have the hang of it now, so a second visit will give me a better experience to gauge by.\n",

I loaded the brush for quite a while longer than normal, 1 minute instead of 3 seconds. I used the wet brush method this time as well. I went for more paintbrush strokes than circles. I was really meticulous with lather today after seeing some videos recently where their lathers looked like icing frankly. I ended up with a much better lather this time than recently. It was great. Lavanille smells incredible, WOW. I am buying a full tub + tonique asap.\n\nAlso, I need to get full bottles of La Quatrième Ville and Bon Vivant. CL is killing it.",

It wasn't a bloodbath like I expected but it wasn't a stellar shave either. Proper technique is so important while using a straight as I'm learning. I consistently used too much pressure with not enough skin stretching. Adjusting to the awkwardness of using my left hand was difficult as well.\n\nI went straight into the shave without ~~stopping~~ stropping. The blade was freshly honed by RocTraitor and I wanted to experience what a properly honed blade felt like. The blade felt tuggy at first and was quite uncomfortable so I just chocked it up to my inexperience. I decided to do a quick ~~stop~~ strop and it made a world of difference. So far my problem areas are my chin, which seems typical, and lower neck. I haven't given up yet. I'll only get better but I don't forsee ditching my vintage Gillettes anytime soon.",

Very close and comfortable 2-pass shave. The razor is very light in comparison to my Slim, so maintaining light pressure is not an issue. Angles in some of the jawline curves and tricky neck spots need to be improved, but that will come with familiarity. Overall, more than satisfied with the purchase\n\nThe Barrister and Mann Glissant base... hrrrmm. Need more familiarity with it as well to get it dialed in and performing up to its full potential. But the smells... Motherfucking *ROAM* on Motherfucking *ROAM*... Yippie Ki Yay motherfuckers!\n\nEnjoy your shave, and your day.",

The MM has another nice scent, which, although I think I like it the least of the three, is still quite nice. I think I like it least because it seemed even milder than the others, and they already disappeared too quickly.\n\nBrief summary: Good soaps, maybe even great soaps. Performance was great, only the post shave feel felt a little lacking. Wish the scents were stronger.\n\nFirst shave also with the ER 1924. It has the dubious distinction of being the first razor I couldn't even complete a full pass with. Yikes. After the MMOC, I thought it'd be a breeze, but I could not make it comfortable. However, it was also my first time using a non-PTFE Gem blade. I'll try it again with those blades. Fortunately, the Rockwell stepped up to the plate, smooth as ever.",

The scent reminds me of a cologne but isn't too overpowering or strong which is a good thing.\n\nHad a slight reaction to the aftershave and Chris was quick and responsive to help me narrow it down to what it could be, excellent customer service. Luckily it isn't bad enough to stop me from using it, so party on. I find I am really enjoying menthol, and will probably appreciate it more during the summer, so at some point I may have to push my limits to see how much menthol is too much for me.\n\nHave a great day and shave everyone.\n",

It is 100% plastic. Extremely light, even lighter than the Fine slant.\n\nI like light razors so it didn't bother me, but I suspect it might be an issue for others.\n\nIt's a well designed razor, a two piece, holds the blade with no play at all when loading and has a fairly unique mechanism that works well. Initially it feels cheap just because it's so light, but it's well made.\n\nThe shave was easy to the point of being too mild, ended up with a lot of touchups to do and even after that just not as close a shave as I'm accustomed to. But supposedly loosening the head a quarter turn works well to make it more aggressive, so I will give that a try next time.\n\nIs this going to be an everyday razor for me? Nope. But it's pretty incredible for the money,\n\nJōvan Musk smells like the '70s and '80s. My dad used it when I was a kid, so it's very nostalgic. Love the stuff, but it's a little like walking around with a really wide tie on or something.",

Same everything else... same brush... same razor... same blade (1 day later), same prep.\n\nToday was a 3-pass shave (WTG and combo X/ATGs). Didn't really need the 3rd pass, could have done touchups, but I wanted to do a 3rd pass for the lather testing. Again I had no problems with the lather (photos here: http://imgur.com/a/R0IO4), other than it took a bit longer to create than others. I have noticed that when I bowl lather with it the way I do... it starts out thin. It doesn't get thicker until I've added more water. It probably also takes more work than other soaps. That said... in the end it worked out well for me. Loved the cooling of the Taconic Eucalyptus/Mint... but had about double the lather I needed. Love the brush.\nHave a great day all...",

Of my 5 Dapper Dragon samples, I have to pick Signature as my favorite. I've already been partial to barbershop scents and other more citrusy scents. I haven't shaved with Seville in a while, but right now, I think that Signature edges out Seville in scent just because this shit reminds me of Ramune. [For those of you that don't know what Ramune is, it's a Japanese soda in a glass bottle that you open by depressing this glass marble with a provided plastic plunger](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSqV2DCyRnbo_9GQvbGZha57FKfWOCKfCgatNjNr1Ynk59QDct8). To me, Signature smells like the original flavor, which is lemon-lime (I think) and is what a lot of Ramune candy is flavored too. This is probably one of my top scents now, along with Cheshire, and I will have to pick up a tub of the matching scale polish in the future. Just have Tiamat and Green Dragon left to try :p\n\nPerformance-wise, I got a good slick lather and my OC was still really comfortable. I'm pretty sure I like this more than my V3 and I can't wait to pick up a V3A down the line. I need to compare the OC to my slim though. I'll be really sad if I like it more than my slim, because I would feel bad just letting a razor that costed 6 times more sit in my medicine cabinet :/ At least I know what head I'll probably get on my way future Wolfman, though I'm still probably gonna get the ATT S1 over the S2, just based on what people say about the harshness and I have kinda sensitive skin ;~;\n\nOn another note, I'm happy with the progress I'm making with the Soap/Aftershave Library as far as formatting and stuff goes. I think the search function works well and once we have a lot of entries in, the redundancy will make up for scent notes one person may miss. I still am not happy with the \"Scent Family/Category\" section cause I have no idea what options to put. I'll see how what I have put in place does for now, but I would love some of the artisans' opinions on it. It's almost the weekend! Enjoy your Thursdays :)",

The weather in the Boston area has still been chilly, as it seems spring is really taking its sweet time to really get here. So I've been trying to use soaps I will stash away during the summer. Mykvior is definitely one of those. It pairs quite nicely with Bon Vivant. I don't know if I've listed this description here, so I'll throw it in just in case: this pairing smells like a forest gnome baked me cookies, and served them with a cocktail. After the shave, one note I kept picking up from the BV reminded me of the smell you get when you flame and spritz an orange, and then rim a cocktail glass with it, which was nice.\n\n[Edit: spelling]",

I'll be taking 9 of my students with me. This is incredibly exciting in many ways, but it's also a major professional challenge.\n\nI do this every year because, long ago, I was a Peace Corps Volunteer in Armenia, and I feel this fulfills the Third Goal: to help promote a better understanding of the host country for Americans.\n\nBeing the good wet shaver that I am, I've been planning my kit for a few months now, and this is it. I didn't want to make this too hard, my needs were a simple kit that I wouldn't care if it got lost and would be quick and easy to use in less than ideal circumstances (we're staying in hostels the entire time). I also needed something aggressive since I will likely go 2-3 days without shaving.\n\nMy only hesitations with this kit were the G2 and the brush. This is my daily razor and brush, and someone at some point expertly modified it to open like an E2 without harming the razor. It would be hard to find one again if it was to get lost. But I felt I needed something quick and simple that provides me with a consistent shave. Same thing with the brush--usually when I travel I use a boar since it's not my daily brush, but, again, simplicity is key in this situation and I won't have time to soak.\n\nThe shave was overall good. The Latha was actually easier to lather with cold water than other soaps that I've used with a cold water lather. I think I may try my I2 before I leave just to confirm to myself this is the razor I want to use, but I think this is what I will be settled on.\n\nHave a great Thursday!",

After the revelation that the Astra Greens I've been trying to replace all along have been more effective than the other blades I've been trying. I decided to go back and check out my R89 again, figuring what the heck right? After applying the lessons I've learned about lather in the last few days I had what was possibly the best shave of my life.\n\nThis shave was almost entirely irritation free, except in one area I've had irritation in for the last few days, as a result I will be passing on shaving for the next day or so to really get things going properly. This was also the closest shave I've gotten yet, the R89 has shaved more closely and far more comfortably than the Merkur 39c. That Razor just isn't for me at *all*, I am probably gonna toss it up on the Bazaar and see about getting something similar to my Muhle. Also, what's worth noting is that my shave was closer today going WTG, XTG, XTG than my shaves with the Merkur going WTG, XTG and ATG.\n\nI dunno, perhaps the lather is making that big of a difference and I need to give the 39c another shot. I gotta say, I do remember having a TON of tugging with the R89 and Astra Greens, and today there was *none*. So perhaps what I thought was good lather actually was crap lather, who knows.\n\nThis hobby really is skill intensive wow. Also as another note, Vide Poche is an outstanding scent WOW! Chatillon Lux salves are far and away the single best feeling substance that has ever touched my face. Holy cow they are great, and the scent is still on me about 4 and a half hours later. Who needs EdTs? Like seriously, Chatillon Lux has an incredible product.\n\nMy only regret was that Vide Poche drowned out the Colonia Splash, I should have just used alum instead of wasting a terrific splash.\n\nAlso, can we get an unscented post shave balm from CL? I would gladly buy a ton of it.",

Long weekend is off to a good start, though. Decided not to make the trip to Canada to see mom for Mother's Day (first one since dad passed last year) & planned surprise brunch for my wife and kids. Had an amazing shave again with my new ATT Kronos. This week I've switched back and forth between the H1 and the S1 -- they both yield such a smooth result. Couldn't be any happier about this new acquisition [somehow still want a Wolfman? Anyone? Please PM me ;-) ]. Still to use my R2 plate. AdP was such a revelation -- thanks again to /u/Huckleberryking for insisting on it being amazing.\n\nHappy Friday everyone!",

I had to add some more to the bowl while lathering. The vanilla Pinaud smells great and is milder than Pinaud bay rum.",

My boss took Monday and Tuesday off, yesterday and today we will do basically nothing. And Monday we greet our director back from his trip, a colleague from Germany who will be here for 2 weeks, and a summer intern. My boss and I (think more like partners) are pretty introverted, and in no way excited to have no time in the lab alone.\n\nThis weekend I'll be going back to my parents where my sister is having a graduation party out of college. She will leave in about a week to go to Missouri for a summer job before she's off to Virginia tech for grad school. She doesn't hear this much, but knows I'm pretty damn proud of her for becoming the first member of our family to go through any post college education. Anyway, enjoy your Fridays!",

Still pretty comfortable on 7, though I did nick myself on my lip (which isn't too bad, since I'm used to using 3-5). Finally got to shave with Tiamat today and I think the scent worked well for this cooler day. I know that it was released during Spring, but I can see myself reaching for it more when it's cold.\n\nThe scent description is: \"Tiamat combines dragon's blood and amber resins with vanilla, then rounds it out with subtle florals. The resulting scent is smooth, with a bit of spiciness and a bit of sweetness.\" I'm not going to try to pick out each note, but I did pick up the sweetness initially, which I'm assuming is from the florals. This is definitely a smooth scent, but I'm not sure if I get any spiciness. When I was trying to figure out what I was smelling, all I could describe it as was \"a slightly sweet, but kinda dark, maybe earthy scent?\" It gives me a similar impression to B&M Rhapsody, but not nearly as sweet smelling; Tiamat gives me a much warmer impression than Rhapsody does. Damn, there are so many great scents and I don't know which ones I'd want full tubs of :/ Good thing it's gonna be part of the permanent line-up, so I have ample time to decide. I think at this moment, I'll probably give Tiamat a 8.5/10. I definitely like it, but need time to see if I *love* it. Solid performer and definitely worth trying out! I just have no idea what to pair it with any suggestions?\n\nIt's supposed to rain tomorrow, so I'm happy I get to end my DD sampling with Green Dragon tomorrow :) Happy Friday!",

I think I dialed in the Mß lather. Hit it with a bit more water and was well rewarded. Even the post shave felt better. I know a bunch of you on here really like the Rapira Swedish Supersteel blades - which I have not tried as of yet - but I think I may have run into its equivalent in the Perma-Sharp Super blades. These are really (for me) a nice sharp blade that is super smooth. Third use and no pulling or tugging to speak of. This is the third razor I have put the same blade into and it performed flawlessly in all of them. And finally, Floïd *Black* is a hidden gem. It is of course a different scent than its famous cousin *Blue*, but it sure as hell lasts longer than the *Blue*. Great Firday shaves to all ladies and gents.",

My mug is usually pretty worn out by the end of the week. Today was no exception. The Kraken is a great choice on a rainy morning though!\n\n\nSo I picked up the Schöne off is Amazon for like $25 (I had a gift card). I've been using it as part of my rotation for a couple weeks and it is surprisingly good once I managed to get the blade aligned correctly. Like many of my vintage OCs, there is some play in blade alignment, but nothing that thirty seconds can't fix. It is moderately aggressive, heavy and delivers an excellent shave.\n\n\nI'm not thrilled with my AS choices right now. I was planning on using some plain old Nivea, but completely forgot in the morning chaos.\n\n\nHappy Friday!",

Based off a comment the other day, I decided to go back to making sure I try all of my CL toner samples even though I know that a reaction is imminent. I only used a few dabs on either side of my face, and the reaction has seemed to subsided after an hour or so. The scent however, still remains and greatly overpowered the main aftershave for this shave, the Clubman Vanilla, so that's a win (even though I like both scents).\n\nFor those contemplating seeing Captain America: Civil War, do it. Definitely near the top of the list / if not tops for Marvel so far.\n\nHave a great day and shave everyone!",

The soap is an LE that /u/c_bubbles had made for one of the FB groups, and it's phenomenal. His luxury cream formula has everything: slickness, protection, residual slickness, post-shave feel, during-shave feel, ease of lather, the kitchen sink, you name it.\n\nThe scent is lovely as well. It somewhat reminds me of Through the Fire Fine Craft's *For Flint*, but with aquatics added to the mix. I can pick out bergamot and neroli with the acquatics on top, with muted oakmoss and patchouli in the base, but that's about it. The whole thing is a magnificent blend. The matching aftershave has just the right amount of menthol (for me) and when I first applied it, I got a hint of tobacco from it that dried down rather quickly. It reminded me of Skin Bracer a bit, except much more refined. All in all, a fantastic product.\n\nThe Astra is holding steady in my NEW. It's still nice and smooth, so it stays in for a bit longer. so far, I think I'm favoring the Lab Blue, but I want to see where this blade goes (and perhaps try a few more) before I decide. That said, I'm getting bored and I think I'll shave with something different next time. Maybe I'll break out my ER 1924 again. Or maybe the Krona. We''ll see where fancy takes me.\n\nHappy Friday, all! Have a great weekend!",

It's a super soft knot. I'm going to re-set it a bit lower as it lacked backbone (I've got two nickels in there to start). No scrub and no scritch. Just ultra soft tips, and pretty slimy too. It seemed to hold on to the lather a little but not bad, either that or I didn't load enough. I think it's really good for the $18 it costs but we'll see how a lower loft treats it.",

It didn't seem any harsher than 7, so that's good to know. I did manage to nick the same spot I nicked yesterday, though.. Maybe I'll skip the moustache area tomorrow to let it heal. Guess we'll see how my face likes 9.\n\nGreen Dragon is some good shit. I'm not gonna say what notes I could pick out since my nose isn't very smart :\\^) Anyway, Green Dragon is described as \"a complex scent that evokes the image of a forest full of growing things\" and I agree with it, though it is different from what I expected. I guess when I hear anything reminiscent of forests, I think of dark, earthy, green scents with pine and cedar. Green Dragon is a fresh take on it; it's like a breath of fresh air when you first walk into a forest after morning showers. Overall, I think I'd give it a 8.5 or a 9/10 based on scent alone.\n\nOriginally, I was going to use La Foret de Liguest (which was what I thought Green Dragon was going to smell similar to), but I thought that it would be too dark, plus I just used it yesterday. Instead, I exit the rainforest Green Dragon left me in and opted for the prairie; Catalan's Prairie is my favorite scent from CL that I've tried so far (only 3) and I'm devastated that it's discontinued :/ It's a slightly sweet, light, floral scent. The floral notes work really well together and I'm not really sure what I'm smelling (I'm guessing it's the violet), since I don't think I know what violets or freesia smells like, but this shit is good. I'm planning to buy salves of the 7 other scents I don't have and maybe the skin salves for my girlfriend.\n\n__________________________\n\nToday we're celebrating my grandma's birthday and I guess my mom and I have to be there at noon so my mom can do dinner prep (guess she's cooking this time; we're having [bánh xèo](http://www.whats4eats.com/files/appetizers-banh-xeo-flickr-24997828@N06-The-Hippie-Triathlete-4380288369-4x3.jpg)). My family's funny cause we celebrate my grandma's birthday on mother's day weekend and celebrated my grandpa's birthday on father's day weekend, since they were a poor fisherman family and birthdays weren't really a priority back then; it kinda keeps things in perspective and reminds me that despite this stress and these expectations I put on myself, my life is pretty damn good. Happy Saturday!",

I've heard he might makes a few batches this year but only time will tell that. YouTuber Robert Ortiz used this the other day and I thought maybe if Travis sees it still being loved it will incline him to get back to it.\n",

This was pretty much what my parents listened to back in the day. The only way for me to listen to music was using the CD player in our car (we did have a cranky old radio but that was used only by my grandpa). And my father wasn't around all the time so pretty much I never go to listen to any music. During the school vacation my father comes home to take me to the hotel he works at. And this album was what we listened to throughout the 3 hour car ride.\n\nLater on he started to listen to some Abba and Trini Lopez. Took me while to find the exact albums we listened then. My English was poor back then so I didn't know the names of the albums or the track lists. I just vaguely remember the album art. Our car pretty much got beat up during the 2004 tsunami so all the CD's in the cubby hole were destroyed. I managed to find the Abba album (gold) and the Lopez album (Latin album) with ease but took me a while to find the exact Nana Mouskouri album. But finally found it couple of days ago after I went through pretty much her entire discography. I've been listening to it on repeat and reliving all the memories it reminds me.\n\nEdit: grammar",

Yep. About midway through my shave this evening, I really found the correct angle and was able to maintain it fairly consistently. This *really* smoothed out almost all the harshness or aggressive blade feel. Still need some fine tuning, of course, but very encouraging progress in technique with the Hydro-Magic this evening.\n\nEnjoy your Saturday, and your shave.\n\nEDIT: I haven't paid attention to boxing for a loooong time, but is the Canelo vs Khan fight gonna be worth watching?",

I eventually did take it too far and just added more soap to the brush. I did my typical first pass and then re-lathered to touch up any spots I missed. Overall a good shave today. It was fun just playing around.\n\nAbout to head out to see Civil War, come back and make Mint Juleps and Bourbon Smashes and watch the Kentucky Derby. It's going to be a nice Saturday.",

I never tried it before since I wasn't comfortable with my technique. That said, I'm pretty sure I'm still not that comfortable LOL I nicked myself once, but it wasn't too bad. I do have to say that I don't think my skin can handle shaving on 9 for all my passes and shave daily, so I'll probably save it for multi-day growth and stick in the 5-7 range. And I think this is the last shave on this blade, too; it got a little tuggy near the end, but then again, my chin is always like that. I can't wait to find that magic blade that cuts through my chin stubble like nothing. The Semogue shed another hair; I really hope it's not defective, because it's really soft. Though, if I do scrap it, I'm probably gonna try out a 620 instead.\n\nWent with the LPV today to see whether or not my skin reacted to it because I want to order it in the luxury cream formula. Tomorrow I'm gonna shave with the LMR for the same reason, and I don't know how long it'll stay in stock :| It's such a great scent, I'll be so sad if I'm allergic to it. Anyway, Lavanille worked really well with LPV and I'm gonna need to get a full bottle when this sample is used up. I can't wait to pick up Cologne Russe and for Mr. Fine's new products as well.. I'm gonna need to pick up a ~~Clean~~ Green Vetiver sample and I'm soo jumping on a puck of the Platinum soap. I'm interested in the Sandalwood scent too, since the girlfriend likes sandalwood. I'm still not sure how I feel about it. I smelled it once in AoS and think I liked it, but I don't remember and don't really wanna walk back into an AoS store and have salespeople breathe down my neck the whole time..\n\n_______________________\n\nThe Mother's Day/Grandma's Birthday party was fun. Family parties are always so lively because of the babies of the new generation with 20+ people over lol. All of my grandma's great grandchildren are running all over the place while everyone else is watching the Warriors game and stuffing their faces. I was there since 1pm helping my mom prep all the food and was there till like 11pm. The bánh xèo was really good and I totally forgot how bomb my mom's bánh xèo is. Man, I really love Vietnamese food. Happy Mother's Day, all!",

Nothing wrong with using a stiff brush. Even Mrs._Hiker likes me to use a stiff brush now and then. When I use a brush with some backbone I like to use a hard milled soap. Tabac gets the nod often.\n\nIt has been ages since last I used this razor. Back to the bottom of the pile it goes. Agressive? Yes. Harsh? Definitely. My straights are smoother and less irritating. It's possible for me to get an irritation free shave with this razor, but I have to go very slow. I can shave faster with a straight.\n\nI got this AS at the Maggard meet last year. I didn't care for it at first, but it really grew on me. Paula said that she would be bringing more again this year. I'll definitely pick some up.\n\nYard work is on the schedule for today. I better get to it.",

I really like the Vert Noir. I'm terrible at describing scents, but its a 'green' scent unlike any I've ever smelled before. Its not floral like CB Royal Garden, nor is it like TOBS Avocado, which to me smells like fresh cut grass. Vert Noir is doing its own thing with a great 'green' scent that I can't really put words to. Get a sample from Maggard and give it a go.\n\nI'd never used Thayers Rose before. Given that it's Mothers Day and I'd already used the Vert Noir, it seemed like it was just calling to be used in today's shave. It paired very well with Vert Noir. Finished up with a splash of Fine Platinum and I'm ready to go. Take care everyone.\n\nedit: syntax",

I had planned on speaking to /u/llee89x of my Standard Razor and the blade gap problem I was having. However, after tonight's shave it may not have been the Standard after all.\n\nHalfway through Friday night's shave I had enough with the roughness of the shave and moved the GSB blade to a Maggard Razors MR18C. Even then, it still felt rough. But I finished the shave. Now, tonight--Sunday night--I picked up the MR18C again. And again, it gave a rough shave. Halfway though tonight's shave I moved the GSB to my never-fail razor: Gillette Tech. It shaved rough. That tells me the blade is bad. Tossed and replaced with a trust ol' Israeli Super+ Platinum and it felt a lot better. So, with that known, my Standard might not suffer from a blade gap problem after all. Further testing is needed.\n\nAs I lay down for bed I get to drift away with the comforting smell of Pinaud Clubman. That's a pretty darn good way to close out the weekend.",

Irritation, irritation, irritation, inefficient. I tried it a couple of times more but I doubt that I have shaved with it 2X since then and was considering selling it on Shave Bazaar. So how did it do this time? Well.....evidently I have finally learned how to shave!!:-) The razor was highly efficient and I have absolutely no issues with irritation. Near BBS or more in my usual 3 passes and a very enjoyable experience. I also wonder how much difference a really good blade on its 27th time out makes? I am going to keep on using this RRSS for awhile and see if I didn't just get lucky.\n\nI am working on the barest of a remaining monk's fringe on my tub of Seville so I am really happy that I have a recently purchased replacement tub sitting in inventory. I have become very pleased with the fragrance. An excellent pairing with L'Occitan, BTW.\n\nIf anyone is looking for a different synthetic brush experience the Muhle STF provides me backbone without spring, has good softness in the tips and makes beautiful lather. It loads easily and is a fine face lathering tool. Good exfoliation while not harsh at all.",

Quite a few little cuts/weepers. Not sure I'm a fan of these. Pretty disappointed with my Parker brush. It has shed since the start and only seems be getting worse. Been looking at Ace Shaving brushes for it's replacement. Since the Clubman is all done I get to use some other aftershaves. As Shockdoc said, Mandom smells like \"citrus, sage, gasoline, and Death Wish style vengeance\". Left me feeling like the \"man with a harmoica\". The stories this tube of Gillette cream could tell... It was one of the first creams I bought. Gettin' towards the end. Excellent performance and scent.

Not sure if a different blade will change things like it would in a DE or not. Either way, I love the Featherweight and look forward to picking up a Damaskene, a 1912, an OCMM and a Bar.\nGood day, to all of yinz!",

I have a few tubs that are very close to being empty so I'm going to try and finish them off this week. It will be a sad day when the VdA is gone. If you are a fan of amber I recommend tracking a tub down. Probably the best amber scent I have come across in a soap. I probably have three shaves left in mine if I use the CH2.",

The shave was very enjoyable though. The Amici line from Razorock smells amazing! Nice spicy grapefruit scent. The performance is spot on; don't let the price fool you- this is great soap and aftershave and it punches way above it's price point.

Henckels 401 11/16 FH\n**Post:** Thayers lavender - extra moisturizer\n\nSo I picked up this razor yesterday in an antique shop. It is incredibly minty. It may never have been used. The inner wrapper is gone but the instructions are still in the box. Absolutely no marks on the blade or scales. No evidence it was honed after leaving the factory. I thought I would try it out without stropping to see where it's at. It needs a couple of laps on the finishing stone. I still got a close shave with it, but it definitely needs a touch up to smooth it out. I may post to the mail call thread if I have time.\n\nBack to sample slaying. I'll be all week on this sample except for Cade on Thursday. One more soap sample after this one then on to the cream samples. Monday sucks.\n\n",

I've been on a Tech/39c kick lately. Forgot how nice the Super Speeds are. There are so many types of Super-Max blades. First shave with a \"Super\" Platinum; looking forward to shaves two and three.

I actually got a pretty good shave; my chin is the smoothest I've gotten it without an ATG pass. We'll see how long I can get them to last though; if they don't last long, I'll probably look elsewhere, as they are pretty expensive.. I got some irritation on my cheekbones, but I'm 95% sure it's not cause of the soap. I'm pretty sure my skin there is thinner or something and the envy white is massacring it, since the rest of my face was fine. Upon closer inspection, I noticed the hairs in my Envy White has quite a bit of variance in hair thickness - some taper all the way, while others look quite a bit thicker. Maybe that's why the backbone is crazy? *Does this brush get softer over time?* I really like my handle and don't wanna destroy the knot, especially since it's new and the only part of my face that it's bothering isn't even exposed to the razor -__-\nAnyway, LMR is good shit and I'm really considering buying it in the luxury cream. I'll try my sample of Menage a Lavande and if I like it, I'll probably add it to my order since Maggards is out of stock. If not, I'll probably throw in a 2oz tub of LPV. After this and 42, I better be done buying stuff for the rest of the month x.x\n\n____________________\n\nNot looking forward to Monday, but maybe this week will be my week. I finished my online trainings for UCSF so hopefully I can start volunteering soon. My boss is out this week and I have no idea what I'm doing right now, so hopefully we can communicate clearly via email.. Keeping documentation on a project you have no background in is pretty difficult lol. Keeping my fingers crossed for that magic phone call this week, but I need to get started on my personal statements as well, just in case. Looking forward to the weekend already. Happy Monday.",

Out of fear of losing my lather to too much moisture, I tend to err on the dry side, much like my fear of bacteria always results in dry, overcooked chicken. I use the damp brush method of face lathering, which produces a lather that looks great. But it really punches up nicely when a bit more water is added.\n\nI've been using some SE razors lately and was anxious to get back to the Wolfman, my security blanket, but the New has been neglected as well. The New is such a great razor--the rugged brass construction, the super slim head geometry, the lightweight handle. I just love this razor. But even with the fancy new paint job, it's still not quite as flashy as the mirror finish on the Wolfman. And while I don't give it the attention it deserves, if the only razor I had were a New I'd be perfectly content.",

      "body": "Soap: Chiseled Face Ghost Town Barber\n\nBrush: Semogue 620\n\nRazor: Fine slant\n\nBlade: GSB\n\nAfter: Fine Fresh Vetiver\n\nI shaved Saturday afternoon with the Fine slant for the first time. It was my first time with a slant, but the razor was intuitive enough. It felt different, like I could feel and hear every hair being cut, which gave me the impression that I was in for an amazing amount of irritation. To my surprise, there was zero irritation and a level of BBS I had never experienced before. I thought I was getting BBS shaves, but apparently I wasn't.\n\nI'm wary of internet hype, especially with wetshaving stuff, so I assumed that all the talk about the glories of the slant was just talk. In my experience, I've never had a closer shave, especially on my neck. Not only that, but I didn't feel that I had quite enough growth today, but it was just enough to go for a two pass. Once I'd gotten through both passes though I said fuck it and went for the third to see what this razor could really do. Once again, BBS with no irritation (albeit a couple of small weepers). This slant is the real deal.\n\nGhost Town Barber is a really really nice barbershop. It smells familiar with a hint of difference to make it interesting. I get a little dust and, not surprisingly from Chiseled Face, a little motor oil or something like that. This is another great soap and I'm in for a full tub in the future to be sure. I have a sample of Trade Winds as well, and I'm really looking forward to it.\n\nFine Fresh Vetiver is awesome. I never knew it, because I didn't really know what it was, but I'm a huge fan of vetiver. I realized this after smelling L'Occitane's Vetyver edt, and now I'm on the hunt for a great vetiver soap/aftershave combo. Fresh Vetiver will be purchased in the near future, but what soap? I was thinking of going for Fine's Green Vetiver soap when that comes out, but what else should I try?",

I will be on the lookout for another straight now, they are just so lovely. Small nick on my lip due to resting the blade on my lip but no cuts from too much pressure. I think I've reached the point where I'd be confident enough to use this daily for a month without irritation, just a small cut here and there lol.\n\nWe were up pretty late Saturday drinking and I was hungover beyond comprehension the following morning. Had to be up at 6 am and spent the hour long drive listening to a screaming two year old. Oh man, these are the times that make you want to never drink again lol.

Today was good, got near bbs and bbs in some areas. I did 4 passes, WTG, XTG, XTG, and ATG. Still working on technique, I am guessing this probably has something to do with blade angle or pressure, not sure, but I should eventually start getting closer shaves with less work. Lavanille smells great, last time I paired with La Quatrieme Ville and that combo was not great. Though I like both individually. Delor De Treget paired a lot better though.\n\nI really need to get my whole preferred blade thing sorted out. I am leaning toward either GSB or Astra Green's at the moment and this week I should know which I prefer. Also I need a tub of Grand Havana + splash asap, I keep opening the pomade container and smelling it haha.",

As I mentioned last time using the Jabonman, the consistency of the lather seems a lot lighter and less dense than many other soaps that I use regularly. It kinda had me second guessing myself, but I still had a great shave, and the lather was slick, protective, and stable.\n\nThis was my 5th shave with the Hydro-Magic, and it continues to impress. The efficiency of the blade really fell off at the end of the shave, but no irritation. I will definitely be loading up a fresh blade tomorrow.\n\nEnjoy your day, and your shave.",

While I really like Pannacrema I don't think I will be buying this again. At least not for quite awhile. It performs as well as anything but the scent is too light. I have enough lightly scented soaps I don't need another. And thanks a lot\n/u/hawns This frag smells really Damn good. They have a custom option available for it on their site. You can pick what concentration you'd like the fragrance at. All the way up to 50%. Costs a reasonable $360.\n\nEdit: It's gone. The little Ebano that was left didn't hold up to water and a super dense badger brush. Feels good to knock another soap off.",

Surprised at the orange citrus from the milk, good stuff and adds a bit of diversity in my aftershaves as I don't have anything full size super on the citrus side like this is. Thanks again /u/Huckleberryking.\n\nDialing back the Fatboy from 4 to 3 over my neck and mole have made all the difference in the world as there is a noticeable difference in feel as I am shaving and no irritation afterwards. Guess I'm destined to be on the more mild spectrum.\n\nHave a great day and shave everyone.",

After recently reading the troubles others have had with this brush, it must just be luck that I got such a good one.\n\nThe sample is still standing strong with numerous shaves left. After a few shaves with the new base I have it dialed in. Very slick stuff.\n\nAfter a hiatus from SR shaving, getting back into the groove is going to take a few more shaves. I got used to going fast with my safety razors and I have to force myself to slow down with a straight. Tuesday sucks just one day less than Monday.",

Good performance (lathers similarly to Tabac) and a nice scent. Definitely a little more subtle than Haslinger's take on sandalwood - overall I must say that every sandalwood scent I've tried smells a fair bit different, though Haslinger and AoS are more similar to each other than either is to Barclay Crocker's sandalwood, I think.\n\nI also touched up the Nevrdull with some water-only laps on my Takashima iromono koppa before this shave. Did x-strokes until I could feel strong suction between the blade and stone, then did maybe a dozen more. This hone has a much more pronounced transition to suction than my other jnats, and is generally very easy to do water only-laps with. The end result was not a laser-razor but it was reasonably keen and very comfortable.",

I really dislike rushing shave. Luckily, the Rocket is mild and going fast doesn't endanger my face as much.\n\nI don't have a favorite AS to pair with the Kraken. Sometimes I use Speick, sometimes Nivea. This morning it was the Damn Handsome Summer Ale. I'm not disappointed with the scent combo. My wife picked up the DH at a local apothecary shop and it has a pretty strong scent that is quite pleasant and lingers much better than many AS balms I've used.\n\nHappy Tuesday!",

I'm glad I got to sample this scent because I still have yet to found a straight up lavender scent that I like. /u/Zignibar56 said something about lavender smelling like sweaty ass to him, and I can kinda see it, but only when I lather with hot water. Oddly enough, I find Champs de Lavande a nicer scent, but it stings my face for a little (what's in these toners? Or is my technique just shit?). If I smell the EO straight up, I'm okay with it, but I don't love it. Thankfully, I fully enjoy scents that use lavender.. as long as it isn't the only scent there; I love Lavanille, Cheshire, and any barbershop scent and know that they have lavender! Oh well, I guess I should be happy to cut out a whole category and save my money, but I still wonder if there's a lavender scent for me :p Looks like I'm getting the LPV with my LMR luxury cream lol. I wanna try Florentine Fern, but I think I'll wait till next month or so to pick up a tub. Anyone wanna sell me a penny sample of it?",

The scent is great and the lather is good. It's not a top 3 but it's still a pretty good soap. I'm forcing myself to use the New rather than the Wolfman all the time. It's a great razor, though not quite as efficient as the Wolfman, and the Voskhod works pretty well in it. I don't love the L'Orange Noir as much as I did last year, but my wife is quite fond of it so I keep it in the rotation. It's a good warm weather scent. Finally, I placed a huge order yesterday--4 soaps, a splash and the 24mm Maggard synthetic. I'll let the 2 synths battle it out--the loser will be relegated to the travel kit and the Wee Scot will go on the auction block.",

I liked it so much I bought one for myself, and a 1912, and a 1924. This one felt really smooth, but I ended up with a little irritation on my neck, which may actually be remnants from yesterday's shave. It seems like I got a better shave with the 1924, closer, with zero irritation, but during the shave I could feel the blade a lot more than I can in the 1914. I'll waffle for a while before I make the final verdict.",

I mostly selected items that don't get used often. They're all great products but they've fallen by the wayside as I've been using other items I prefer more. Having said that, Drunken Goat will always be my favorite. This is one of the first artisan soaps I tried nearly two years ago. This is the one that left me wanting more and more, artisan after artisan, but I always come back. This soap is like a rite of passage for any new wetshaver.\n\nI occasionally have trouble with OC razors but the NEW paired with a fresh Voskhod was good to me. The Brut was nice as usual. Paired well enough with DG. Yeah, man. That's the stuff.",

The Micromatic belonged to my wife's great grandfather.

In the end, I decided to get one for myself and give it a measured assessment during their 30-day tryout period.\n\nSo far, so impressive. The one slightly disconcerting part is that it needs a good amount of pressure to engage the head, but once you do that you're rolling. Last night's shave was one of my best, equal to the best I've gotten from any safety razor and perhaps just a touch behind the truly effortless Feather MR3. It's a bit tricky using this head in tight corners, but a little angle change usually does the job. I was going on 2 days of growth and the OneBlade just ate right through it no problem. Left my face with virtually no irritation above baseline as well.\n\nOverall, this was a very good start. The FHS-10 blades, I've heard, are _very_ short-lived, so I'm interested to see how far one goes for me before I have to toss it. Unfortunately I don't have any GEM blades so I can't try the despined GEM for comparison. All the same, I think this is going to be a pleasant trial run.",

I've only used it once before, and that was when I bought it a couple years ago. Don't know what made me think of it; must be the cooler, drier weather we've had lately. The smell really does make me think of fall (even though there's no such thing as fall in Florida). Something about the scent makes me think of cool air, clear skies, dead leaves crunching as I walk, holding a cup of hot cider. This is one of very few soaps that actually gives me that kind of feeling- normally all I get is a scent without a vision from most soaps. This one is truly something special, and I can't believe I've only used it once. Maybe I'll keep it in rotation for now.",

Maybe I'm starting to hit my stride in wet shaving after these 2 years.\n\nThe Vetivertal just popped this morning. Excellent scent as I lathered it in the jar. The soap was slick, good cushion, and my face felt great after. Very little irritation from the blade this morning. This could be due to me switching to a more mild razor. Everything came together for an excellent shave though. I love Fine's Green Vetiver as well. It's a really smooth scent.\n\nI'm looking forward to this weekend. I'll be at the Maggard Meet-Up and I started planning my purchases last night. I think instead of getting 1 or 2 large soap pucks I'll probably grab a bunch of samples instead. Thoughts? I really want to try more artisans as well as scents.",

Brutalt Bra was a relatively unknown manufacturer compared to many of the established European soapers. I think by the time the LE was announced the stock on Bullgoose was all gone and it had glowing reviews. Then again, so do a lot of soaps these days.\n\nI probably could have started with a wetter brush than I did. It loaded up surprisingly fast...and I think I underloaded it even due to the appearance. The way it loads up in the brush reminds me of MdC a little bit (though this is certainly a softer soap than MdC). Very easy to lather. I didn't really have time to test how well it takes on water...next shave with it I'll be a little more generous.\n\nThe Norwegian Spruce scent is very well done. It's more of a \"woodsy\" scent than a \"Christmas Tree Pine\" scent to me. The post-shave is above average. My skin didn't feel overly dry after I finished shaving (before applying balm). My only irritation is in a few spots carried over from last week that haven't fully recovered. I guess 2 days was not enough.",

I keep nicking myself once a shave with feathers lol. Still don't know if I'm allergic to the CL toners since my face gets a light burning for ~3 minutes. I was wondering if the small amount of alcohol could cause it, but I don't remember the Fine Aftershaves burning me like that. With that thought in mind, I decided to try to use Platinum after the burning subsided to see if alcohol caused my reaction - Nope. Went to apply more LFdL toner to see if I would react from another dose - Nope. Now I'm confused. I'm 90% sure that the amount of good shit from the first application of the toner protected my face from the second application of the toner lol. I ended up buying salve samples of all the scents I don't have since I know that I don't react to the salves and wanted to try out all of /u/hawns's scents. For the sake of science, I chose to buy Yuzu/Rose/Patchouli in all 3 iterations to see if the high amount of lanolin in the toners is causing my reaction. Guess we'll see soon \\o/\n\nTrying to figure out whether or not I like LPV enough to buy it in the luxury cream with my LMR. I'm actually between all of the luxury cream scents except Menage a Lavande. In the D/NP thread, Catie's Bubbles is apparently going through a complete soap line revamp so maybe I should wait to buy LPV, LTV, and UJG and just pick up Florentine Fern since it's a limited time scent? I don't have any fougere soaps and this one already sounds interesting as a brighter fougere. Anyone have any recommendations? I think I'm leaning on Florentine Fern if the other 3 are going to be remade in a new base (any idea when that would happen?)..",

Stone Cottage's *Cedre Noire* is a great scent, and the cream's performance is wonderful as always. The cedar in it is definitely the strongest note, and there's a bit of musk, softened by light vanilla. I don't get much of the black pepper although the whole thing does have a bit of a dark quality. It pairs nicely with Paolo's *Bosco* scent since it's also cedar-forward. It would pair excellently with L'Occitane *Cedrat*. Gotta pick up a tube of that at some point.\n\nHappy Hump Day, all! Enjoy your shaves!",

It's a little rainy-misty in the low 50s here this morning, and it feels very springlike - Rhapsody is a great accompaniment to this weather. The scent is deeply floral - for some reason it reminds me of that incredible scene in *Moby Dick* where the narrator falls into the head cavity of a whale and just swims around in that chamber of sweet, silky sperm oil in a state of ecstasy that swallows him and cuts him off for the rest of the world for a brief moment - Rhapsody gives me that impression, if only momentarily, but swap the whale for a fresh spring flower. It's deep man.\n\nI actually think I like the splash even more than the soap too.\n\nAs for the Fine slant, I'm still liking it. It is aggressive and it is efficient without causing much irritation. I liked it with the Standard handle, maybe slightly more than with the handle the razor head came with. Then again, I'm not sure I need a shave quite this close all the time. I can do three passes with the Slim and get a great shave with zero weepers. For some reason, I'm getting a weeper or two with this Fine every time, even though I get almost no feedback from the alcohol splash. This razor will be a great addition to the den, but I don't think I'll be using it every day.",

The only other variable here is the CRSW. I did some drunk ordering a while back and ended up with the Vetyver Fresco and Bois Floraux. I've tried both one time and while they didn't really grab me, I like the VF more this second time. What I didn't like about it was the \"Fresco\" part, which reminded me too much of the too-citrusy Puro Fresco. With \"...a fresh herbal citrus top note...\" in the description you'd think I'd know better. Still, CRSW is a great soap base, so it's just a matter of finding a scent that suits you.",

So one of my younger brothers is in the Army. He is getting ready to ship out to Iraq in August so his platoon is out doing training somewhere in Tennessee. My sister-in-law gets a phone call that someone in his platoon was killed during training but they don't confirm who it was. Just that someone died and it could be your husband. They don't call her back for **THREE** fucking hours. My brother Patrick is fine and I'm not sure what happened. She didn't say anything to any of us because she didn't want us to be worrying as well. I can't imagine what was going through her head. After she told my our mother what happened my just lost it. She has been through both of my younger brothers going to Afghanistan and other places but for some reason this really affected her. Don't really understand why the Army would call family members and say someone died and it could be your loved one but we don't know yet and then not call people back for hours. Jeez the federal government is damn stupid sometimes.",

Can't say it went well, but at least in wasn't a disaster. Having difficulty getting the blade angle correct I'm assuming. There were times where I was dragging it across my face and there was literally no contact with the blade. Straight up and down is fine, but going horizontally WTG right below my jawline was tough, at times I felt I needed to use a bit of pressure just to get the blade to contact my face. End result was an acceptable shave though not particularly close or comfortable.\nAnyone have any tips for tomorrow's attempt?\n\nEdit: after a few minutes of facesturbating it actually was a fairly close shave.",

I'm not sure I could even cut myself with this razor!!! Then, I went hard at 1 spot on my chin. I felt nothing ... I mean nothing... but the blood came... and continued. The hype about the feather blades being sharp... I now believe all the hype. LOL. Fantastic shave all around, and a reminder that you always need to respect the blade.\n\nHave a great day all...",

Even my barber is impressed :-) I love the Valet for this purpose because I often let it go too long and this thing mows down lots of growth with a vengeance. When I'm actually shaving the sensation is like shaving hair with a really sharp pocket knife almost... it feels really harsh and loud. The loudness is different than just the normal audible feedback. The weird part is that when I'm done there's no irritation and I'm left with a wonderfully smooth shave. Plus there's the bonus of the thing looking all badass and whatnot with its gears and hinges! I just really like this razor. The RR soap however is pretty meh. Performance was fine but after getting into lavender soaps like CF, AOS tallow, B&M, etc the scent is severely underwhelming. Not a huge issue since it was a night shave before bed, I don't want to smell like something all night anyway.",

      "body": "[New Gear: Pils 101NE / Carnavis & Richardson Custom Titanium Handle](http://imgur.com/2bhf4ok)\n\n**Prep**: Hot shower and Myrsol Emulsion\n\n**Razor**: Pils 101NE\n\n**Blade**: Polsilver Super Iridium (1)\n\n**Brush**: Shavemac 2-Band Silvertip in Carnavis & Richardson custom titanium handle\n\n**Soap**: Tabac\n\n**Aftershave**: Speick\n\nThis is my first shave with two significant additions to my collection: a Pils 101NE stainless razor and my new Carnavis & Richardson custom titanium handle with a Shavemac 2-Band Silvertip (26x48 fan). To complement the Pils and Shavemac, I continued the German theme with Tabac and Speick.\n\nI've tried to condense my den to just my favorite razors and I've been pretty happy with the lineup I have so far (Tradere SB, Wolfman SB, LASSCo. BBS-1, Weber PH). However, I still have the itch to try new items, so I'm allowing myself one spot for new razors. Of course, if the new razor turns out to be one of my favorites will put me in a tough spot. I don't see myself selling any of razors in the current line up. I've been interested in trying out the Pils for a while, but its high price tag and limited availability has kept it out of reach. But one popped up on a BST board recently and I decided to jump on it.\n\nThe Pils is a pretty unique design since it's a 2-piece razor. The build quality is quite good with excellent finishing work on all exterior surfaces. I don't like the smooth handle--it doesn't provide a lot of grip. If I end up loving this razor, I'm going to have to find a way to get one of the Triad Pils handles like [this](http://shavenook.com/showthread.php?tid=32062&pid=597247#pid597247) or [this](http://badgerandblade.com/vb/showthread.php/486519-Pils-101-NE-Safety-Razor-with-Triad-Aristocrat-Handle?p=8138975). Luckily, the handle wasn't an issue during the shave. It doesn't inspire confidence, but it wasn't slipping out of my hand either.\n\nThe shave was quite nice! The razor is insanely smooth and comfortable--perhaps the most comfortable razor I've ever used. It was smoother and provided for a better shave than the AS-D2. The head of the Pils is a little bulky and I didn't get the closest shave in some of the trickier spots. Hopefully with a few more shaves, I'll be able to figure out the right technique. The closest competitor in my razor collection would be the Tradere SB. The Pils might be a tad more comfortable, but I think the Tradere is easier to use and provides a slightly closer shave. If I had to make a choice today, I'd pick the Tradere over the Pils.\n\nI'll save most of my comments and pictures regarding the new brush for Tinker Thursday, but I love the brush handle (thanks /u/Eighchops)! I can't stop looking at it. The Shavemac knot performed beautifully. The softest brush I've ever used. Even though I set the loft pretty low (about 47mm), it didn't really have any appreciable scrub (I was looking for a little bit of scrub). But it produced a wonderful lather and was a pleasure to use. Love, love, love this brush!",

Not normally a fan of vegan soaps, I'm *very* impressed with this one. It yielded a lather on par with B&M Glissant and Cade rich cream--fluffy and creamy like hand made whipped cream. However, as with other vegan soaps in the past, it wasn't quite as comfortable as my best tallow soaps. I'm going to keep at it though because this stuff is outstanding.\n\nThis is my first time using the MLS Bodhisattva. I was expecting a Nag Champa scent. I don't know why though, considering the scent description says nothing to indicate it would. Maybe because incense is mentioned and Nag Champa is the only \"genuine\" incense scent I'm familiar with. Regardless, that's not what this splash smells like. There is some spice, incense and floral stuff going on here though and while it wasn't exactly what I was expecting, I do really like the smell. And then after the scent swirls around your head for a bit, the menthol sashays to center stage to give you a nice buzz. A bonus I didn't realize when first purchasing the product is that 15% of the sale is donated to Buddha's Light International Association. I like making the Buddhists happy!",

I'm very happy to own a REAL standard, after having used a german clone for the longest time I can say that the Gillette is a lot smoother. Not to say that the clone wasn't a good shaver but it definitely was more aggressive.\n\nGreat BBS shave. Now to drag my corpse to class. Have a great day guys!",

I gave it a test lather/destinkifying in the afternoon, then shaved with it last night.\n\nWow. The hype is real. I didn't think a natural brush could really feel softer than the Plisson-style synthetics, but this really does. Like rubbing a fluffy bunny around on your face. No scrub, no backbone, but worked fine for face lathering especially since I use a lot of paintbrush-y strokes.\n\nThese things are normally $200 but if you dig around you can find them on British sites for half that. At around $100 it's a pretty incredible value. Super luxurious.\n\nI got 100 Rockwell blades for a cheap promotional price. Had never used them before. They have an interesting grabby feel in my Standard, not tuggy but like when you test a knife edge on your thumb and if it's really sharp it grabs right on. Nice shaves but after three it seems to be fading, so maybe not the longest lasting blades.",

I'm a big fan of Fine Platinum, and ordered this because they're both based on Aventus, and I honestly prefer the Stiriling version of the scent. It's very pineapple-forward, and just smells incredible. Shave was pretty good, but the blade is getting a bit old, so I'll be switching it out tomorrow. I normally vary my soap/splash use day to day, but I can see myself using this combo for a while!",

      "body": "A truly **grand** shave of the day today\n\nSOTD 5/12/16\n\nYesterday's shave was bad...today's was significantly better.\n\n**Prep:** Hot Shower\n\n**Brush:** Fine Accoutrement's 20mm Angel Hair Synthetic Brush\n\n**Razor:** Muhle R89\n\n**Blade:** Feather (2)\n\n**Soap:** Mickey Lee Soapworks Grand Havana\n\n**Post:** Cold Water, Extra Lather\n\n**A/S:** Mickey Lee Soapworks Grand Havana Splash\n\n**Balm:** Dapper Dragon Scale Polish unscented\n\n**Pomade:** Mickey Lee Soapworks Grand Havana Water Based Pomade\n\nSo yesterday's shave was not so fun, at first I thought it was the feather blade, but after today I know for a fact what it was. You see gentlemen, I have indeed been using the appropriate blade angles and pressure for quite some time. Yet, I have still been having somewhat unpleasant shaves, until today that is. Turns out shaving with dry lather is playing this game on the highest difficulty.\n\nI took some advice that if my lather was drying out at any point that I my lather needed water. So I spent a lot longer working on lather today than normal. I got it to the consistency that I wanted it to, thick, yogurty with no bubbles. After that though I remembered that most people mention wanting it to glisten slightly. So I just kept adding water and kept on going. Some areas on my chin looked like they might be drying out but were still slick enough to shave with.\n\nI could stand to add a wee bit more water, but overall I gotta say the improvement in my shave was seemingly life altering.\n\nAs an aside, you know how everyone has a soap they are obsessed with, a scent that they would gladly smell like forever. Grand Havana is it, literally my favorite soap ever, holy cow.\n\nIf MLS could make this in balm form, shampoo form, Eau de Parfum (pls), deodorant, body spray, air freshener. On that subject, any suggestions on Cologne pairings with this?\n\nI've tried B&M, MLS, Stirling and Chiseled Face so far and I wanna try some other artisans. I know I will be getting Fine's AOS Sandalwood clone for sure. I was thinking of trying Dapper Dragon, LASSCO, CRSW and possibly Catie's Bubbles or Sapone di Paolo.",

I've had them before and let them go, but ever since Drive I've been buying up flavors that appeal to me and have been getting wonderful shaves out of all of them. Wisdom is no different, peppermint forward, with just enough lavender in the back to soften everything up. The balm is the star of the show for me however. It has a fantastic chilling burn from both the peppermint and menthol and leaves me feeling soft and moisturized. It's light too, light enough to even wear in the summer. The brush is on loan from a friend and is shockingly good. Too expensive for me to look at seriously, but at least I get why it's worth so much. It just plain feels expensive in both fit and finish as well as in performance. Happy Friday everyone!",

Henckels 11/16 QH\n**Post:** Lucky Tiger - extra moisturizer\n**Frag:** Grey Flannel\n\nSo today marks my 100th SR shave. Originally, I had intended to use my grandfather's razors (2) for this milestone. But I decided to kept them as they are, just the way they were in 1955 on the morning he last used them. The morning he suddenly passed away. Instead, I wanted to revisit a shave I did a while back as an homage to this man who passed before I was born. Nothing fancy. Just good workable tools.\n\nI don't bloom any soap except this one. I soaked the shit out of it. I'm never going to proclaim that this is a great soap, but I got a decent enough lather from it with a big fucking brush to actually get a pretty damn nice shave. It's the kind of soap my grandfather would have used, bought one puck at a time at the corner market. I'll always keep a puck around for milestone shaves to remind me that sometimes the simple things need to be appreciated. My grandfather was a simple man. If it was good enough for him, who am I to question it.",

He sent me a box LOADED with samples of Bufflehead soaps and some real nice splashes. One of which I used for tonight's shave. His generosity is always surprising and very appreciated.\n\n/u/chevro1et, yesterday you mentioned Admiralty and Shambala go very well together. I was going to do that tonight, but due to having family over I just wasn't able to grab my bottle of Shambala. Next time! Fear not, Agua Lavanda Puig was very much up to the task of providing good smells post shave. Thank you!",

We all know that when it comes to pressure, no means no. I thought I was using no pressure, but with this razor being so light, I think I was adding some unintentionally. The shaves were still nice, but I was getting a few weepers. Today I really concentrated on my pressure and blade angle (which seems a little steeper than other razors) and I had a great shave. This razor gives me the closest shaves I've ever had - I only wish it was made of metal.",

After seeing it mentioned time and again, and despite a den bursting at the seams, I finally buckled and bought some. (What can I say? I'm weak.) The Scent is a lovely vetiver, nice and green. (It reminds me of something else I've smelled but I can't nail down what it is.) The only other MLS soap I've had was the Grand Havana release from last year~~, so this is my first \"reformulated\" version~~. I was impressed with the soap, getting a darn fine lather with it the first use.\n\nThis was also the maiden voyage for the Maggard 24mm. I've been using the Fine 20mm synthetic for close to a year now. I thought it was a bit small, thus the 24mm. Now that I've used the 24mm, I'm thinking the 22mm would have been a nice Goldilocks size because this one is a bit on the large side. The loft is pretty high too, but it covers a lot of ground and it lathers well enough. Lost a few \"hairs\", so I hope that won't be a continuing problem. Overall, I give it a thumbs up, but time well tell which synthetic gets demoted to the travel kit. Speaking of which, I bought a Simpson travel brush tube. The small size was too small for anything but my Wee Scot--which is currently for sale by the way--but the large tube is quite a monster.\n\nI've been using the New all week. While it looks great, courtesy of Delta Echo, and shaves well, to be honest I'm looking forward to getting back to the Wolfman.\n\nMy first experience with Chatillon Lux was the GLS salve. The scent is intoxicating. So when the alcohol splash became available I ordered it ASAP. Scents don't always translate well from one medium to another, and I was a bit disappointed with the aftershave version of GLS. It's not that I didn't like it, just that it wasn't quite as captivating as the salve version. Well, I think I'm over that. The aftershave has really been growing on me and I now look forward to using it. It has the same general scent as the salve, but stands well on its own.",

Packed up all the samples I'm gonna mail out today. If everything goes well, I should be good for June after I buy a couple LASSCo and MLS samples :)\n\nYesterday for some reason I thought I was a day late in getting my TB test checked and was so pissed. Luckily, I called in to see when the earliest I can get another TB test was and the woman on the phone was like \"Uh, if you come in before 5 pm, you can still get it read.\" and that's when my dumb-ass finally realized 48-72 hours after Monday was Wednesday-Thursday. Mental math was not my friend today lol. My girlfriend has been teasing me and calling me \"old\" lately because I turn 23 this Saturday (even though she's turning 23 in June) and this definitely gave her more ammo lol.\n\nAnyway, I had the privilege of watching Yo-Yo Ma perform live at Davies Symphony Hall in San Francisco with my mom last night. I used to listen to him for a bit in high school when I was really into band/orchestral/instrumental music (still enjoy it, but I only really listen to music as background nowadays). I can see why he was a child prodigy; that man is still killing it at 60 and damn, he can make a cello fuckin' sing. He even gave 3 encores and has a really funny stage personality. Happy weekend everyone (almost anyway)!",

Getting the brush took much less time than I expected so I had to wait, but the wait is over! The face feel of this brush is amazing; this is nothing like any other badger brush I've used before. The tips are incredibly soft, and the brush has a nice amount of backbone and it doesn't hog lather at all. I am totally in love with this thing. The handle is just perfect, and the pics don't do it justice. The blue silver and purple swirls throughout the handle have a gorgeous shimmer that changes in the light. The shape closely resembles a Simpson 58, which was my favorite shape until I got this one. u/g_huck does amazing work, and I highly recommend him! The SMdF provided me with a fantastic shave as usual, and I love the scent. Top tier stuff from Razorock, and I recommend it to anyone who enjoys a unique tobacco type scent.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/IcV7tZL.jpg",

Beautiful city, stunning. The image above is from our window of Envoy Hostel (stay here when you come to Tbilis, they rock!). There's a better view from the balcony but I haven't figured out how to take a good picture with the shave stuff in it yet.\n\nAll that said my shaves have sucked. I think my razor got messed up somehow. My last two shaves have felt like dragging a blade across my face. I mean, yeah, that's what I'm doing. But usually it doesn't feel so...pronounced.\n\nNow off to eat dinner and drinking Georgian wine. If you can ever find Qvevri style Georgian wine, buy it. I've had wine from France, Germany, Italy, Australia, America--Georgian Qvevri is the best by leaps and bounds.",

The Wilkinson is so cool in a steam-punk kind of way, and the roller guard can be adjusted to vary the distance from the blade edge. I find it a little harder to keep the proper angle versus an Ever Ready, but that might just be my lack of familiarity with the Wilky.\n\nPerformance was great-the only reason the shave wasn't BBS was that I missed a spot on my neck. Three passes produced a nice smooth, irritation-free result everywhere else. Hallows is fantastic, and it's funny how different people pick out different notes. My daughter gets chocolate, which I don't, but I get caraway, which I've never heard anyone else mention. The protection spell cast, I'm ready to take on the day!\n\nHappy Friday to all.",

As noted by others, the packaging/presentation is quite nice. But honestly I find the real value in this soap is in the performance, not the nugget or the porcelain.\n\nI had already tried the Ramos Gin Fizz and enjoyed the performance, though admittedly the post-shave was definitely drying. Not enough to dissuade me from picking up Goldrush under the impression that they were the same formula. Apparently, as I discovered, he's updated the formula due to feedback reflecting similar experiences and has increased the superfat content with great success. Still a very slick, creamy lather and now a stellar post-shave as well. Again, this is not just a gimmicky limited release, it's a damn good soap.\n\nI'm going to try to resist fishing out the gold nugget. We'll see how long I last.\n\nAlso of note: this is my second shave with the first Kai blade I've ever used, and I'm mad. It's a great blade. I may actually prefer it slightly over the Personna Reds, of which I just ordered 200. So I may be begrudgingly ordering some Kai blades in bulk once I do some further testing. Sigh.\n\nAlso, getting stoked for the June challenge. I was still mostly on w_e this time last year. Now I barely check it.",

I can't wait to finish all these samples before June lol. I keep a log of all the scents I've tried to try and see what scents I want full tubs of. Then I was thinking that I really can't afford to buy more than 1-2 tubs a month LOL this is gonna take a while. This blade is really comfortable for me; did some blade buffing on my chin with no irritation whatsoever, though it doesn't seem as sharp as others. I think I can afford to bump the slim up to 5 or so with this blade.\n\nThat said, it's my birthday today! Excited for sushi for dinner, not as excited for working on my personal statement. I'm pretty jealous of all of those that are going to the Maggard's meetup. So many people got into Georgetown off the waitlist today and it feels like my chances are dwindling at an exponential rate. Maybe working on my PS will help give me some closure and help me move on and hopefully the sushi will give me a food coma and help me forget my sorrows. Happy Saturday!",

Just a really nice, clean shave with zero issues, and an amazing post-shave feel. Add the Executive Man scent to it all, and it was one of the most enjoyable shaves I've had in weeks.

F. Trumper Extract of Limes Skinfood\n\n-------\n\nSo this was my first DE shave ever! My husband had let me use his soap and brush the past couple of weeks but I had still used a typical disposable razor those times. I chose to try my sample of Midnight in the Garden to see if I want to swipe a full tub before I can't anymore. It lathered up just fine and I really like the honeysuckle scent, so I think I will. I was a bit shaky, but slowly and surely I was shaving! It was awesome! Even with taking a few extra minutes I didn't get quite as close of a shave as I normally achieve but I didn't nick myself either! So I'm going to practice and hopefully in the next few I'll start getting those nice smooth legs. My husband then gave me a bit of his Limes Skinfood. He also gave my the brush I used after I was done out of his collection. He's such a sweetie. But I fear we'll have two wet shaving addicts in the house now, oh well.",

Don't think I have gotten to 7 shaves on a blade in a while (recently getting to 5 or 6 max) but no signs of slowing down.\n\nWent with the PdP balm as out of what my SO has commented on so far, it's her favorite. She is usually completely disinterested, but also likes Clubman Vanilla and strongly dislikes Lavanille.\n\nHave a great Saturday and shave everyone",

Of course /u/OnaBlueCloud being my sidekick, *really* had to twist my arm to pick up various items... LOL. BTW, really good dude.\nMy score on the Beaver Woodwright is an easy A+. This stuff lathers up by just looking at it and it provides a thick, creamy, protective lather. *Ghost Ship* is a really nice combo of sandalwood, black amber and grapefruit. I did not pick up the matching aftershave, but I did pick up the cooperative crossover pack from Dr. Jon's and Beaver Woodwright called *Bandit* (herbs, citrus, incense, patchouli, leather, and whiskey). This is my first go with BW aftershave as well. First rate quality as well with the aftershave. And yes, I am in /u/fuckchalzone's (another great dude, but I did find out that he is NOT a magician with Reddit names). [photo](http://imgur.com/qsqm6ml) but I am in disguise. I am the one with the white golf cap on talking with /u/Old_Hiker and /u/OnaBlueCloud - which keeps my \"flowing locks\" from getting in my face - LMFAO!! I have the hair of /u/dendj55 (Ruds). Anyhow, this was another artisan that I now have tried and have no issue giving my highest recommendation. Have great Sunday shaves ladies and gents.",

Shaving Soap Co. Vert Noir\n\n**Post:** Re-lather, Alum & Cold Water\n\n**Aftershave:** Mickey Lee Soapworks Reunion\n\n---\n\nAlright, so this is some of the large haul I got at the meet-up yesterday. This is a lot of firsts and I hope I can give a good first impression on these items.\n\nFirst off, the Fat Handled Tech. I was up in the air about this or a ball-end tech. What surprised me was the handle is hollow! I picked it up and it felt incredibly light. I like the fatness of the handle. Very easy to hold. I think the light handle won me over as compared to the ball-end tech.\n\nShaving with it was good. First impression is that it's a super mild razor. It did still leave a pretty smooth face. I'll use it for the rest of the week just to get some practice with it and get a better feel for it. There was no irritation which was good. I like it after 1 day. I'm thinking I'll send it off to DER to get it touched up and bring some new life to it.\n\nVert Noir looks like weed. It's green with some black spots in it. Lathering it was super easy. I should have picked up an LASSC soap before now. The performance was excellent throughout the shave and I could have done more than my usual 1 pass. The scent might not be for everyone. The dominant note is certainly green grass. That's all I got when I was first whipping it up. Throughout the shave the soap evolved. I started picking up green tea, jasmine, and frankincense. I really started enjoying it as I was shaving. Very good soap!\n\nI have heard so much about Reunion by MLS on here I decided to get the aftershave. I had never previously used an MLS aftershave. Scent was it is certainly green, just like the Vert Noir soap. I certainly get the \"murky\" tones that MLS describes but I can't really put words around it besides that. There is a mint scent that I get as well. Very good scent and I'll pick up the soap when I deplete my Kracken soap.\n\nVery good shave overall. Looking forward to trying my new stuff over the next few shaves.",

It was nice to meet his business partner too. Breakfast at Tank's is on me for both of youse.\n\nThe soap is the new release from MLS and the sample size is friggin' huge. It's definitely a green scent and it makes me feel like working in the garden. This razor is quite the surprise. I won it as a door prize which saved me from buying one. This razor shaves incredibly well. I have read /u/arbarnes comment about it often and was curious enough to want to buy one. Every now and then I come across a vintage razor that just impresses the hell out of me with its performance. The NEW, '46-'47 Aristocrat and the ER 1914 are three that gave me great shaves with the very first use. I can add the V3A to that list. It really is that good. It's one of the best values with respect to price/performance ratio. I think this is going with me on a road trip in a few weeks. Now on to yard work.",

I have too many! After having this soap sample in my cabinet for 6-8 months, I got around to using Signature today and boy was it a mistake to wait so long. Signature is wonderful, absolutely wonderful. A lovely scent to accompany superb lather. I might just have to grab a tub of this stuff.\n\nThanks to /u/chevro1et I got to try Chatillon Lux - Yuzu/Rose/Patchouli toner. Honestly, I wasn't expecting to like it at all. I have many CL toner samples and none of them have felt real good on my skin. They leave my skin feeling all prickly and needle-y. I don't know how else to describe the feeling. Well, I am very, very glad I decided to give Yuzu/Rose/Patchouli a try because it felt great. I got none of the prickly feeling as I did with all the other toners. Nice!",

I picked up a tub of *Ruby's Green* up at Maggard's. This smells like I am in the middle of a tomato batch, checking over the plants. It is accurately described as \"green\" part as opposed to the tomato itself. Really a very nice Summertime scent. For me, the new formula wasn't anything Earth-shattering. Maybe because I really thought the \"old\" versions were first rate. The \"new\" may be a little quicker to lather? Slightly creamier? Don't know. I do know that MLS is right at the top compared to *any* artisan soap. I was scrabbling to figure out what I have that is Earthy (but not dirty) and green... \"oh yeah, I picked up the new CL *Yuzu/Rose/Pachouli*\". I pick up mostly the rose in this one. Now, I don't know if I like that or not. It is a realistic rose scent. I am out of my comfort zone with \"flowery\" type scents. I will see how I like it throughout the day as well as multiple uses before I permanently decide. I will tell you that this is my first CL aftershave (have salves and toners) and it is very toning for an aftershave. I had to do a double-take to make sure I picked up the aftershave and not the toner. Another home run /u/hawns. Great Monday shaves to all ladies and gents.",

The Catie's Bubbles splash is going to be GOOD. It's the perfect amount of menthol and left my face feeling soft and supple despite not feeling heavy at all. Plus, the anise and fougère elements came out a lot more in the splash than the do in the luxury cream. Also, after taking a whiff of his Barnegat Bay scent, perhaps I don't hate all bay rums. CB is breaking down barriers for me!\n\nAlso, Henri et Victoria was a really great lather. On the brush it looked a bit airy and foamy, but once it got on my face it didn't feel that way at all. It was so slick and did an incredible job, plus the scent was very pleasant. And I sat next to Claude all day, who is a very nice and super insightful guy. (hell, everyone there was just mega-nice and very free with their advice to a guy who is just starting out. Much appreciated).\n\nFinally, I traded for a tub of The Holy Black's water-based pomade. A little less hold than I normally go for, but just enough that it's going to be useful. Despite the fact that I never knew how much a lightweight I was until hanging out with him, Mr. Carnavis, Mr. Richardson, and Mr. Bubbles, ended up talking a lot with Mr. Holy Black. Really stand up guy who is happy to own what happened in the past and is working his ass off to be better. I was very impressed and look forward to trying out the Sandalwood Smoke soap I have on the way.",

Last night CF Lime was in the lineup.\n\nMy experience with creams has been limited. TOBS was in my first mail call and I received some Cade rich cream from the wife a couple of Christmases ago, but for the most part I've been using nothing but soap since I started wet shaving. The primary detraction is the fact that good creams cost significantly more than good soaps both by volume and again when factoring the fact that you will almost certainly go through it more quickly than a hard soap. Castle Forbes is no exception. At $38, it's one of, if not *the*, the more expensive lathers I've purchased. But I'd been seeing it come up a lot on SOTDs so of course I had to try it.\n\nIt smells great, like a lime flavored popsicle or Life Saver. This should be nice during the hot months ahead. I was concerned I'd overload like I did the last time I used Cade, so I dusted off the [lather bowl](http://www.captainschoicestore.com/shop/chocolate-lather-bowl) and scooped some cream into it. I went to work with the brush, adding a bit of water here and there, and the stuff exploded pretty quickly. While pretty lathers make nice SOTD pictures, I'm more concerned with performance.\n\nI had 3 days of growth and with that much whisker to cut just about all decent lather does a good job. (For some reason I don't fully understand, just one day of growth is far more challenging in terms of comfort.) The CF Lime performed really, really well. It was *very* comfortable and provided enough cushion to allow for an ATG pass on the neck. BBS all around. But strangely, it wasn't slick. In fact, when shaving it caused my razor to stick to my face. Not stick as in sticky like a spilled margarita, but sticky like wet rubber. Very strange, as I've never experienced this before. But all's well that ends well and I'm very pleased with this cream.\n\nI've used the 24mm Maggard synthetic a few times now, so I think I can offer an opinion. It works great, but IMO the knot has too much loft and I'm not fond of the way the fibers splay out in a cone shape. It's a good brush, though I've lost around 10 \"hairs\" so far. In a direct comparison, I prefer the 20mm Fine, so perhaps I should have gone with the 22mm version. Maybe I'll pick that up in the future to find out.\n\nI used my Delta Echo New SC last week and have been experimenting with SEs lately, so it was nice to have the Wolfman back. I normally use Voskhod, but I've been digging the Kai blades, so that's what I'm using this week.\n\nFinally, I used the MLS Bodhisattva aftershave splash again. I wasn't sure what to think of it the first time as I didn't get a distinct scent, but this time around I picked up the incense immediately. I really like this scent. The face feel is fantastic, with just the right amount of menthol.\n\nSheesh, sorry about the wall of text. I didn't intend to write a novel.",

Pretty good shave; this luxury cream surprisingly can take a bunch of water! Ditched the Ladas to revisit the Astra SP. I definitely like it better, but I think I like other blades better than this. I'm going to have to add some Rapira and Polsilver blades to my next Maggard order or check out tryablade soon. Not sure if my nose is broken, but the AS seems to smell a lot more different than the soap.. Maybe I'll have to smell it again tomorrow lol.\n\nWasn't that productive today in terms of working on my application either. I think I've been giving myself until this week to cling onto hope before attacking this thing at full throttle. Had a belated birthday lunch with my dad today and went with my gf to pick up her sister from some event afterwards. I'm so glad Game of Thrones is back; shit's intense.\n\nEdit: wrong date lol",

The Gillette Thin Platinum blades work far better in an S1 than anything else I've tried them in and give excellent shaves. The Mondial was a weekend purchase at Maggard because I love the scent; the performance is extremely good, head and shoulders above many of the other soft Italian cream soaps I've tried.\n\nThe post-shave gel was purchased on a whim and proved to be far better than I was expecting; my face feels soothed and not at all greasy, with a mild, slightly spicy lavender scent left over. Going to test the rest of the scents first, but I'm heavily considering ordering a bottle of the stuff. Way better than I thought it would be.",

Hopefully James opens up the wait list so that all you can get one as I highly recommend it.\nI had to pick one of my favourite soaps to give it its inaugural shave and it was stellar as always.\nHappy shaving everyone!",

The fine superlite slant is incredibly light, it was a weird feeling, not feeling anything on my face I had to fight the urge to press down on the skin. Terrific shaver otherwise. Earned a place in my daily rotation. Baby butt smooth in three passes.\n\nNow, Gingers Garden. I didn't know that Irena made two soaps in dedication to Prince. I was expecting to get Paisley Park, but Purple Rain smells phenomenal the scent notes are described as rain, dewy raindrops, lotus petals, ozone and white florals along with a touch of musk. I got her Tallow formula, top notch performance, the splash is great and very moisturizing. The scent is by far the longest lingering scent I own.",

Lather was on point, and a known performer, so it wasn't to blame. This was shave #6 with the blade, and the previous one was binned after shave #5. Additionally, my mind was definitely not on the task at hand this morning. Meh. I'll survive.\n\nEnjoy your shave, and your day.",

      "body": "- Soap- Haslinger Honey\n- Razor- Rockwell 6S\n- Blade- Dorco Prime\n- Brush- Razorock Italian Flag handle w/ Amack knot\n- Aftershave- Dove for Men Sensitive+\n\nSo with my last purchase from Italian Barber, I snagged one of those Italian Flag handle plissoft brushes. The goddamn glue bump was halfway up the exposed loft of the knot, and pretty much made the brush useless. So, I decided it was high time to put that Amack Game Chnager knot to use. I steamed out the original knot, and expoxied the black synthetic knot into the handle, and man it turned out to be a looker. The black knot with the Italian flag colored handle is gorgeous. The knot is, in my opinion, much better than the plisson style synthetic. It has a touch more backbone, softer tips, and splays more naturally than the plisson, making it feel a bit more like natural hair. Definitely a winner. I also found a blade I like better than the GSB in these Dorco Primes. They're maybe just a touch less sharp than the GSB, but a bit smoother as well. I used to get the best shaves from GSB with the exception of my lower neck line going ATG, but with the Primes it's smooth and comfortable no matter how I shave. Considering they're also about 60% of the price of GSB's for a 100, I have a new favorite blade.\n\nhttps://m.imgur.com/gallery/hal39",

Two things on this shave: I am really liking the Gillette Tech. It is so smooth and effortless for me. It may not provide the closest shave but it just really works for me. I'll be switching blades out tomorrow to see if things stay the same. This could have been my best purchase on Saturday.\n\nSecondly, I am finally get use to the synthetic brush. It really takes such little water to get a good lather. The brush just holds on to water like it's nobody's business.\n\n\nGreat shaving today. Going to switch it up tomorrow for a mid-week break. I'll probably go with the other Dapper Dragon I picked up on Saturday.",

After months of it I just want to use some full size products for a few days. I have no idea why I added to my sample collection at the meet.\n\nThe thread about tobacco scented soaps inspired me to use this soap even though I just bought a tub of HeV Cognac & Cuban Cigars. The lanolin in Tiki provides me with a great post shave feel. Too bad it's not as widely available as it once was.\n\nI touched up this razor a while back and it's holding the edge pretty well. I'll chalk it up to beginner's luck. I picked up a NOS Henckels 401 a couple of weeks ago and touched up the factory edge on Sunday. I'll give it a go tomorrow. It's Tuesday. Off to it.",

Overall, nice shave and nice scents, only made better if I had found a larger nugget ;)",

This is the soap that people should get if they are indeed looking for a \"Cigar/Tobacco\" smelling soap. This isn't the green tobacco that a number of soaps have in them. Claude did an outstanding job putting this together. The only *slight* drawback I had with it is that is tingles on my face. It does not get any worse like \"face on fire\" or anything, so I will definitely be keeping it. I searched for a aftershave that would continue the theme and I went with *Unforgiven* (DUH!)

I had a nice post shave and the smell lingered quite well despite it's subtle scent composition. It smells, nice. It's complex. I can't describe what it is, maybe some fancy sophisticated lotion? Dunno but I like it and it pairs decently with Y/R/P. Sir /u/hawns please continue your excellent work, this one is a winner. All I'm missing now is some TSM Fougere Toner.\n\nThis brush is dope. There's a good chance you'll never see it again /u/Huckleberryking. I look forward to using it on a softer soap. I want to see it just explode in ridiculous amounts of peaky lather. The bulb does indeed make a huge difference, it's dense, it's gel, and the face feel is just pure luxury. I need one.\n\nI haven't gone this long without shaving in almost a year so it was an incredibly satisfying shave. (4 days)",

The Sherlock is a tobacco scent that smells *great*. Big fan there. But I'm afraid my brush was a bit too wet as I had the big bubbles that evolved into lather that was too fluffy and not very slick. So not the most comfortable shave. I will try again soon.\n\nI was able to buy the CL Fougere toner (I think I got the last one)--and it's probably my favorite post-shave scent--but I was not aware that an aftershave was also made. Being a rather greasy faced bastard with a history of staph, I prefer alcohol-based splashes, so when I saw this one for sale on the Bazaar I jumped on it. The scent is virtually the same as the toner (read: *excellent*) but with the burn it's even better.\n\nThe combination of the fougere scent, alcohol burn subsequent to the rough shave and post-splash buzz made for probably the best post-shave product application in my history of wet shaving. Most invigorating, I was compelled to send Shawn a gushing missive like some cloying, sycophantic toady. Needless to say, if this stuff is ever released again, I strongly urge you to pick up the version of your choice.",

Finally got the formal offer and it'll be a pay cut. That's not ideal, but should be manageable. The only hangup is that I'm still working my current full-time job. So this would be a day off, otherwise. But it is not. Oof.\n\nAnyway, The Black Rose kicks ass. I was hesitant to pick up a rose scent, but I've been enjoying a rose-scented leave in conditioner lately and thought I'd try my luck, as I've been dying to try the new black formula.\n\nLo and behold, it's basically just Myrkviðr with rose added and no beer! Crazy. Crazy good. I'm a fiend for Myrkviðr, so this didn't have been a better surprise.\n\nScent was everything I'd hoped and more. Performance was great, as expected. I suspect I'll have more to say about that after a couple more shaves, too.\n\nAlso, on another note, I figured out what to get my wife for her birthday/ graduation from her Master's program (both coming up in about a week). She's going to be so stoked. Baggu makes nice leather backpacks that I've seen her lusting over on multiple occasions, and I know she won't spring for it herself.\n\nHave a nice Tuesday, all.",

I skipped Sunday, and went back to the 1914 for Monday. I've bent the tabs slightly to hold the blade a little tighter. It worked, but I think the blade is done for after the slipping, so yet another just ok shave. My neck hairs have now seen 2 days of crumby shaves, and a missed day. This is potential for disaster. Against my better judgement, I decided to try an unfamiliar razor. /u/tiglathpilesar was so kind as to send me a Popular #47 to try out, so I decided I wanted to try it today. I didn't make the wrong decision! It was a great shave! It was milder than I am accustomed to, but that's ok. My cheeks went super smoothly, my neck too with a little persistence, even after the growth, which usually ends up in a bunch of irritation. I had to do more passes than I like to on my neck due to the mildness of the razor, but I made sure to mind my technique. Everything turned out well! Shout out to /u/tiglathpilesar for sending this over for me to try! Big up!!!",

Seriously, people, visit this country. It's insane. Soaring mountains, friendly people, Stalin's shaving kit. And the wine flows like water. And it's cheap as all getup.\n\nI could go on and on but I will tell you about my shave. It felt great. I had 4-5 days of growth because I don't have time to shave and I'm in a hostel which isn't the most wet shaving friendly environment. But I managed it today and it was glorious. The razor continues to feel a little harsh but I messed with the head a little and I'm hopeful it will no longer rip my face apart. Other than that it was a great shave, BBS in 3 passes with a cleanup pass in the chin region.\n\nOff to Yerevan tomorrow for two days before heading to the Armenian provinces. It's almost 2 AM here and my marshuka leaves at 9 so I should sleep, but my lovely Georgian friends had me up drinking wine in an old caravan stop on the Silk Road until about 1:30. Amazing. Come to Georgia!",

Blade wasn't as smooth as previous shaves but pretty sure I can get another use out of it. For whatever reason decided not to use too much balm, so didn't rally get much of the menthol, but it definitely helped paired with the splash.\n\nTonight's shave (assuming I don't get home too late) will be with Diamond as I am going to the Mets Nationals game tonight for a friend's birthday. Kind of wish we looked at who was pitching when we decided what day we wanted to go (Bart vs Gio isn't the best matchup), but really any game should be fun in this series.",

I popped a new blade in there, the Swords have worked with every razor I tried so far, and the shave felt better than yesterday. It was very comfortable. DD Signature is a barbershop scent with a twist. I get very strong melon up front with subtle hints of powders throughout. It's a very interesting scent but I like the fresh fruit scent from it. Great performance too.\n\nExcellent shave again today. Have a good Wednesday everyone!",

I like the Latha Sandalwood but it's just a little too sweet for me. Black Powder is another one of those products I used to love but don't use all that much anymore. It's strange how tastes change over time.",

It provided a mildly uncomfortable shave. Today I stuck in a Super+ Platinum and I could tell it was perfect on both sides. However, like last time, the razor itself doesn't glide across my face as it should. My assumption is it's the finish on the metal, because I never have this issue with my Techs or Super Speed.\n\nAnyway, I did just one pass of WTG with the Standard then decided to remove the blade and transfer it to the MR18C. The rest of the shave went real well. I'm really enjoying the DD Signature scent. I felt like it went well with a splash of Floid Blue, courtesy /u/chevro1et. But what do I know? I'm not a scent specialist.",

I really like lathering out of full tubs but I can't justify buying full tubs of everything that interest me, especially if there's a chance I don't like it, though I do bite the bullet with limited releases (looking at you, Roam).\n\nSwapped back to the GSBs today and got a better shave. Damn it I hate hot weather. Decided to do a cold water shave to help cool down. The menthol helped too. Okay high 80s isn't hot, especially for you that regularly experience 100s+ (which I get sometimes), but I get hot real easily.\n\nThink I finalized my school list, but might narrow it down.. Thinking of playing it even more safe than last year and apply to about 40 MD schools (about half reapplying and half new schools) and 10 DO schools. Time not actually work on my personal statement and update my activities from my last application.. 2 weeks till the application opens and I'm not going to dilly dally again. I wish I didn't have to go to work so I can work on this. And I really hope I don't get called into jury duty today.",

I'm headed back to Pittsburgh for my niece's wedding. I've got a nice dopp kit, but it just isn't the same as being at home.

I've been wanting to try this one since it's an olive oil based soap, and generally shave soaps that have olive oil don't do too well, either with the lather dissipating or not lathering up well at all. The lather was great- easily built, super slick, and lasted the entire shave. This soap has one of the creamiest lathers that I've come across, and post feel was very nice. The scent is nice and fresh, and is a good summer scent- light, citrusy and green. Overall I'm very pleased with the soap. I think we may be hitting a point that we can't dismiss soaps just because they have olive oil in the ingredients- Calani, Nanny's Silly Soap, and CRSW all have olive oil based soaps, and all are fantastic performers.",

Coming home from the game last night got stuck in a ton of traffic and the Mets just didn't have it last night.\n\nOn the upside, after 2 games of searching, finally found a new offering they had at the stadium this season in the form of Nutella stuffed rice balls (fried and covered in cinnamon, of course). They were a pain to find and in one of the \"clubs\" even though it was probably the worst club they have. Originally our tickets didn't allow us access so the woman turned us away from entering, but we decided to go around and try the other entrance. This time, my friend remembered to try using his mlb badge (he works for mlb.com) and we were in! Made sure to walk by the other woman on the way out who originally didn't let us in to indicate that she had lost the battle.\n\nShavewise, had some irritation on my neck, may have been from the previous shave, not sure. Managed t get my ear good somehow during one of my passes, and Styptic was necessary. Diamond reminds me a lot of Roam, and not remembering or looking up exactly what's in there, felt like they share enough of a scent that aftershave wise it would go well with Diamond, and to my nose it did. After 5 hours of sleep, the Roam is still going strong!\n\nHave a great day and shave everyone!\n",

It goes ATG like nothing. Thanks /u/fitzman49 for letting me borrow it. I put my stainless Triad on it because I'm not a huge fan of a lite razor. The balance was pretty good. Really easy to have just the right amount of pressure. I've only ever used the Feather Pros before and they seem to work very well for me. I have a couple different Kai blades to try but I think I will use this one for a couple more shaves.\n\n",

And damn it smells great.\n\nResult? A perfect shave, better than near BBS without a hint of irritation That isn't an error on blade usage. This was its 37th shave and it remains sharp and efficient. I have been teaming it with various razors, Pre and Post War Techs, RRSS and my NEW SC and it is excellent in all of them. In \"the good old days\" men actually used blades until they didn't cut anymore. This blade is nowhere near done. In fact it cuts as well now as it did when it started out and it is buttery smooth to boot. There are a group of members on B&B who use a blade until it drops and they have their own private cult thing going on. I'll have to pass 100 shaves to be worthy and even then, who knows?",

If you're into nerdy pursuits, and board games, check it out; it's hella fun.\n\nI absolutely adore *Réunion* and *Mean, Green, Clean Vetiver,* but as scent pairings go, I think *Le Quatrième Ville* is a better match for the soap. I may need to pick up Fine's *Green Vetiver* soap at some point, but I really don't need any more soaps right now.\n\nThe Eversharp Krona is a sleeper hit of a DE. It's really an amazeballs razor. Every shave with it so far has been ridiculously comfortable and efficient. My hand was a little shaky this morning (see the note about carousing above) and I gave myself a small nick, but user error is user error. So far, the GSB blade is treating me much better in the Krona than it did in the NEW.\n\nHappy Thursday, everyone! Enjoy your shaves!",

My WTG pattern grows in such a way that it's already a challenge with a DE but with an SR it was even harder haha. That said my XTG grows great for both so that's something. I did better with my left hand than my right hand, and I am right handed.\n\nOverall I did about 1.5 passes with the SR, my cheeks were easy enough I felt compelled to try the neck, I did okay on the neck. No cuts though that was good and some mild irritation but nothing major. I did WTG, XTG and XTG. I felt the blade from the SR really tugging at first, not sure if it was me or the lather. Razor was definitely sharp enough that I can tell ya.",

I think it was because I had a little more time this morning to slow down and enjoy the process. I was really careful with pressure and short strokes which lead to minimal irritation. The razor doesn't feel as great as at home, but an overall nice shave.\n\nYerevan is one of my favorite cities in the world. The city of teeming with restaurants and cafe--last night I drank 15 year old Ararat brandy at a jazz club until 1 AM. It's also amazingly walkable. The city center is ringed all around by a large park with fountains and cafes. The people are so friendly--and it's rather cheap. I just bought a pair of handmade leather boots for less than $100 USD.\n\nHave I convinced you to take your next vacation in the South Caucuses yet?",

It's a softer soap, similar to DD, and the scent is like an Orange Creamcicle. The scent strength is on the medium side, and smells fantastic to me. The soap loads easily, and doesn't need too much water to build up, but it can also take a fair bit of water. The soap is pretty slick, and very creamy; not the best I've used in terms of slickness, but still better than average for sure. The lather stayed put and didn't dissipate at all during the shave, and after a cold water rinse I couldn't detect any scent left over. One thing I have to knock this soap for is the post shave feel. It left my skin feeling pretty dry and tight. Probably a good thing for people with oily skin, bit since I have dry skin it's tough on me. I've read that since the samples, he has increased the amount of superfatted oils in the soap but I have to base my review of what I have in front of me. Overall it's a good soap, and looking at the price on his site of $19 for roughly 5oz it's not a bad deal. Am I going to rush to purchase a tub? Probably not. While I like the scent, there isn't anything about the performance of the soap that stands out to me. Still, it's a good soap and I would recommend it, especially if he increased the oils for the post shave feel.",

I've only used this twice now but I have yet to find the breaking point.\n\nDue to some lackluster experiences with some well regarded veggie soaps, I've considered myself to be (by default) a tallow guy. Saponificio Varesino worked OK, Cade rich cream even better, but I have never had a really \"wow\" experience with a non-tallow soap until I used this one. It's really, really good. That said, both times I've used it I've experienced a little bit of irritation. Not with the shaving, but simply be being on my face. It's minor and didn't linger after shaving off the lather, but worthy of note all the same.\n\nI hadn't used the Floid Blue in a while. Because it's the largest bottle of aftershave it goes in the back of the shelf, so I don't reach for it very often. Additionally, while the scent is pleasant, it's not especially interesting, so I hardly ever use the stuff. Applying it with an atomizer (courtesy of /u/cakeerdeath) is conducive to [Thurston Howell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gI1w3cwcUPY) impressions. :-)",

I finally got some muscle memory started and was able to go WTG across my whole face, no cuts or nicks on this pass which was great!\n\nI went for XTG and was able to do it across most of my face, until I got to the chin, I couldn't figure out how to get under my chin, I got a small nick here. Lather closed it up no problem though. I finished up with the DE and did a third pass XTG with the DE to clean up. I really needed more water in my lather today wow, I should've been more aggressive with water usage.\n\nFirst time stropping went well enough, I did nick my strop a teeny bit. Overall I'm getting a lot more comfortable with the straight and frankly getting a more comfortable shave.\n\nI learned something about blade angle though, and I think that might have been the source of my troubles with the DE. I have been using the Muhle for so long I honestly forgot what the blade on my face felt like. After using the straight I really am appreciating blade angle a lot more and I think I've had too harsh an angle on the DE. I'm now able to detect and feel for the blade on my face which is helping me adjust until I can just barely feel it on the DE.\n\nThis has been a really illuminating experience thus far. I gotta say, I may have the straight bug.\n\nAlso, my Silvertip brush holds waaay more lather than the plisson synthetic of the same size. I think I want a bigger brush, if I get this new job I will probably commission a custom brush with a really dense Silvertip knot in it.",

My lather was awesome too--I'm starting to wonder if Tbilisi (where I got **awful** shaves) just has really hard water or something which resulted in such poor shaves. Everything in Yerevan has been great.\n\nThis was my last shave for about 4 days as I'm headed off in to the Marzes--or provinces--of Armenia. Doing a lot of sightseeing while I'm there, but also getting the chance to go to a few wineries and businesses to round out the experience.\n\nCan't believe I have only 9 days left. I love visiting this region. Good thing I get to do it once a year for work!",

My first use post impressions are as follows...\n\nThe performance is excellent. Really, really excellent. The soap loaded easily (about like B&M Glissant for me) and was able to handle lots of water. The lather started a little bubbly, but quickly transitioned to thick, smooth, dense, heavy, elastic shave-ready goodness. I gradually increased the water content, worked it in, and the lather became satin smooth and shiny.\n\nI had the brush overloaded and had to discard some lather into the sink to allow myself to work in the amount of water that I wanted to. It just sat there and floated without dissipating for several minutes.\n\nThe lather provided ample cushion, great protection and slickness, with above average residual slickness. The post shave feel is velvety smooth and supple. I haven't applied anything other than Thayer's as I'm typing this, and may not use any aftershave at all. Maybe Shulton Old Spice or Floid Blue to finish up with, we'll see.\n\nThe scent is an affront on the olfactories. Strong, pungent, smokey burnt gunpowder, bourbon, leather, and supposedly some rose in there somewhere :) It smells like Guns'N'Roses-style rock'n'roll. My girlfriend hates it. My man /u/ketchuegrast smelled it, and he didn't have any desire to keep a sample for himself. Haven't heard what /u/uselessgreggy thinks of it yet. But I like it.\n\nEDIT: the scent description taken from [Ballenclaugh's website:](http://ballenclaugh-soap.myshopify.com/collections/frontpage/products/guns-n-geraniums)\n\n>The smell of fired guns covered by a bouquet of roses with an oak moss base. Now better rounded with other notes such as leather and bourbon\n\nEnjoy your Saturday, and your shave.",

Zero irritation, BBS and incredibly easy to use. Sometimes with a DE I lose the right angle and have to adjust, I don't think that can happen with the Goose. Once I send this back I will be getting one of my own. Most likely the stainless model.",

The thing literally Sings when you use it.\nAs for the soap, I've never been a fan of lavender scents but this is the first thats won me over. There's an earthiness to it that prevents the lavender from becoming too heavy and I also get a hint of spearmint which is really refreshing, which is strange considering there's no spearmint in it as far as I know but it's what I pick up. I'm definitely gonna have to pick up a full tub seeing as the hotter weather is coming, hopefully.\n\nHave a great weekend everyone.",

At its price point it represents an incredible price/performance ratio. I only have four modern razors and the Fatip is the only one I use...until now. This one is going to get used a lot. It will definitely be my travel razor. It's advertised as an aggressive razor, but I get zero harshness from it.\n\nI set this knot in an unbranded vintage handle I bought several months ago. I have about 6-8 more vintage handles needing knots. I'll likely use a variety of knots in them. This brush did a really good job on its maiden voyage. I find that RR works best for me if I load it heavier than other artisanal soaps. The brush easily made a good lather and held 4+ passes with no trouble.\n\nMy son is visiting from out of town and he's a chip off the ol' block. He likes boar brushes. I bought him a 610 at the meet last week and he already likes it after only 5 uses. We'll be hitting some antique shops today. I'd really like to find a good deal on a straight. Good times to all.",

Their scents are never exciting, but they do smell clean which is a welcome change sometimes. This stuff is everything I expected MWF to be but wasn't. Easier to lather, slicker, and better post shave. I think I need to get the rest of the line. The Honey soap is nearly as good as the Sheep's Milk soap.",

I like the scent and the lather is perfectly fine. Not as slick as some of my other soaps, but just as easy ATG on my neck with no problems. I've never used an AS lotion before, so the stickiness that is left is a little odd for me. Either way, skin feels good and smells good.\n\nAs an addendum, after some thought I'd postface my \"not as slick\" comment with I didn't soak the puck in any water and just took a brush straight to it. I haven't been using hard soaps lately, and just treated it like a cream. I had heard it is really slick lather, so this might just be user error for me.",

With a bit of research, we found a recipe that looked promising.\n\n- 91% isopropyl alcohol\n- witch hazel\n- all natural glycerin\n- Vetiver and lime essential oils\n\nI made a test batch this morning. I'm thrilled with the results. Top note of lime at application, then a lingering scent of Vetiver. I didn't know what Vetiver was before joining the wet shaving community. I'd been missing something very good.",

I quizzed the husband on which blade he had given me the week before and he said it was a Derby. I'm thinking about maybe switching blades after another shave or two. I know the razors are normally good for many shaves (don't remember exactly how many) but legs are a lot more surface area than a face.",

Glissant is about as good as it gets for me, and the scent profile is refreshing and light without being too bright pr overbearing. It's complex enough and the tea and ambergris ground it enough that it doesn't beat you over the head with floral or citrus notes, even though they're very clearly up front. I don't have a lot of lighter scents and I'm not generally into detergenty, 'fresh' scents, so this is going to get a lot of use in the coming months.\n\nAlso, my wife loves the scent and especially the packaging. She said that it's her favorite of all my soaps. Usually, when I get a new tub or handful of samples, her reaction lands somewhere on the spectrum from bemusement to thinly veiled annoyance. She was genuinely stoked on 42. And that was pretty fun for me.\n\nWhat's more, I'm a HUGE fan of the HHGTTG 'trilogy' and am really quite excited to have something like 42 in my cabinet.",

It feels mild but it had no problem mowing down the growth I had. I swapped to my Triad handle half way through and there was a noticeable improvement. The extra weight helped carry this right through on my ATG passes. To be clear I had no burning or irritation that I can feel, but my face red along my cheeks and jawline. Not sure if it's the soap or the razor but my face feels awesome so whatever. First impressions are exquisite, this is a well machined beauty.\n",

Wow, it was way more comfortable than my last shave and it was removing a lot of stubble. After the first pass, I turned it to 9 and it was way more comfortable than I thought. It was able to tackle stubborn areas very easily.\n\nGoing to use this razor for the rest of the week but I think it may overthrow the Rockwell as my favorite razor.",

My previous experiences with Jabonman were with his Brisa de Oriente soap. It burned my face, and while I initially blamed the cinnamon in that one despite no other cinnamon burning on my face, I left it at that. This soap smells great. I would compare it to Kraken. Still, not my kind of scent (like Kraken), but I can appreciate that the scent is a good fresh scent.\n\nSo I went and lathered it up with the [G_huck brush](http://imgur.com/a/bFGp6) that I got back last week, which feels amazing on my face btw, threw the lather on my face and my face melted off. I powered through it and all was well again. Then I threw on witch hazel and my face was on fire again.\n\nI finally got an opportunity to try /u/MrTooNiceGuy's AS booster (it's for splashes and so far I've been using balms lately). I followed the instructions on the back and surprisingly didn't get any burning like I expected due to the soap irritating my skin. It was really pleasant and smooth. I'd say it was almost turning my AS into a salve like something /u/hawns would supply from the CL line, but still more liquidy.\n\nNo burning, and 15 minutes later my face feels great. I guess I just can't buy Jabonman anymore. Gave the last soap I had of it to my father, and I'm glad I got this sample, since I realize now that it wasn't the cinnamon messing me up, but the soap itself.\n\nTonight's shave was made possible/sponsored in part by /u/IllegalMonk for the free samples, and /u/MrTooNiceGuy for shooting me that free sample of his booster. Looking forward to a possible future release of it! Thanks guys! Have a good (and safe) Saturday night and remember to have a DD on hand!",

Honestly you can't really go wrong with a good citrus scent. This was my first time trying Strop Shoppe, such great performance, and the scent is really pleasant to use. L'Orange Noir I'd say was a nice fit for it. I got 4711 coming in soon so we'll see how that is.\n\nI'm still not liking this Semogue. It kills my lather, but I'm not losing faith in it just yet...but I'm kind of leaning towards the synthetic knots now.\n\nHave a great Sunday everyone! Today is offially friday! Off to the flea market in a few hours to see what I find!",

Ruby's Green kicks ass too.\n\nlast night [set this sunrise knot in a vintage handle](http://imgur.com/LLCrIdi) i got from u/drivenlegend so looking forward to using that tomorrow! Love the look of the handle, was gonna get a nice badger knot, but undecided and i want to use it right away. used silicone instead of epoxy for the first time, hope it holds, if not no big deal i guess ill just set it again.",

Aside from being unsure how to load the blade (which seems to involve luck as side clamps no longer function with the new design of blades), I also had no idea of what I was doing with this thing. As a result I got half a pass of dragging and tugging, could not find the angle that would get it smooth and not tuggy/skipping over my skin. I tried to angle it more so that the top cap was almost flat against my face and then played with it from there, but still couldn't get it to shave smoothly. So I switched to the flare tip to finish things up, and respect the flare tip so much more now after how much easier it was to shave. Catie's Bubbles was very easy to create an excellent lather, ended up loading a bit too much tho.\n\nBottom line, any tips on how to shave with an SE, or the 1914 ER specifically are much appreciated.",

Now that I've had the brush for a couple weeks and the \"new brush\" excitement is subsiding, I still find this to be my favorite brush hands down. I understand why some people love these high end badger brushes even though there are amazing cheap synthetics out there. The face feel and backbone of this brush is perfect. Now I'm tempted to get a 2 band silvertip in a chubby style with a fan knot. The bulb shape of this one is nice and gives a good massage, but I can only imagine how a larger fan knot would feel.",

And I finally got a good shave with my 620! I had been having trouble getting the brush to hold enough lather for more than one pass. Yesterday, I went at loading with an extremely wet brush, and really loaded like I hated the soap. I ended up with more than enough lather for my usual 2 pass, and could probably have gone for four if I had tried. Maybe I will keep this thing after all.",

You already know how good it is. This scent is very pleasant and is a good one for summer.\n\nIt's the start of another work week and so it's time for using the straights. I found myself getting too comfortable today and I started moving too fast. I caught myself before there was any accidents. I am at the point where I am confident in my ability to use a straight effectively, but I really don't ever want to be too confident.\n\nI believe I have decided on what knots I want to get for a couple, maybe three, of my handles. I am pretty certain I'll be getting Frank's Finest. After so many comments by so many users, this seems to be a good fit for what I'm looking for. I may even get them ordered by the end of the week. Now my problem will be reorganizing my rotation. I like having the consistency of a 7 brush rotation, but with a nice badger that I found in a shop a couple of weeks ago and two synth knots that I set in vintage handles over the weekend, my OCD is kicking in. I don't know which brushes to bench for the time being. First world problem. Yuck Monday. Off to it.",

With the added knowledge, and the fact that I was sober for the shave, I attempted to improve my technique with the SE. Alas, I ended up with almost the same exact results, not being able to finish the first pass as it was skipping/tugging and left my face feeling a bit raw (the clubman confirmed that). /u/vigilantesd, I realize the pic may not be the best but [here](http://i.imgur.com/0tizLmP.jpg) is a pic of the razor.\n\nI'm sure I'm just not doing something right, and am still optimistic that I'll get it right, so will have to continue to play around with it for tonight's shave.\n\nEdit: put wrong brush, force of habit",

Kudos to Maggards for packing their samples that last me well over the claimed 5 shaves. I was slightly more productive yesterday; I wrote like 3 sentences of my personal statement, though I'll probably scrap them. I need to just dedicate time to just word vomit all over a word doc or something. At least I worked on other parts of my app. First lab meeting today at 9:30 even though I haven't even started at the lab yet lol, so I'll be finishing my safety training afterwards. I'm excited for the experience, not so much the 1.5 hour commute. Haven't woken up at 6 in a while.",

Interesting but nice pairing with Bon Vivant.\n\nNeeded a somewhat rough shave, I guess, because I'm going to Cardinals vs Cubs tonight and tomorrow night, and it's going to be rough to be a Cards fan for the next three days.

I did have a few nice shaves in spite of the limited kit.\n\nSo I come home to find my package from MLS! Mail call is always exciting. It may have led to some unusual pairings, but I couldn't help myself. The Réunion is not exactly what I expected. The scent is more earthy than the Vetiver EdT I use, but I think I like it. It takes me a few shaves sometimes to really decide, but as I'm catching small whiffs of it on my train ride this morning, I'm thinking this will be one I like. The blades were thrown in by /u/SammyLee as was a sample of MLS Ruby's Green and a military discount that I didn't ask for. MLS Rocks and I am a fan boy. All in all, a great shave to start the week!\n\nHappy Monday",

First time with arctique. I loaded too much and didn't have enough water but it was ok my eyes took care of it. Tears help make a pretty good lather. Holy cap this stuff is cold. Or hot I can't tell. I couldn't see any redness or feel any iratation or anything at all for that matter. I was laughing historically the whole time at how cold this felt. Never really had anything with a lot of menthol in it. AdP and Santa maria del fiore I think is the extent of my menthol experience. This was a fun shave. Good for a Monday. Now off to work. My hands are cold by the way. I think",

It's just so different from the dense, creamy, heavy lathers that I typically use. Proof is in the pudding, so they say, and I certainly cannot argue with the protection, slickness, and post shave feel of the Jabonman. Smells damn good too.\n\nEnjoy your shave, and your day.",

Don't worry, I get out of work at 0300 Hrs and get home at 0325 Hrs so this is normal for me to drink at this time. This is my night time. I am really hoping my Silverloaf comes in the mail today. I traded my Filarmonica Sub-Cero 14 for it. I am hoping it is as good as I hope it will be. Reef Point is fucking awesome. I honestly choose Reef Point most of the time when I want a soap over a cream. Aviator is just fantastic. It is basically like I am smelling a leather jacket with some fresh open air mixed in. My Illuminati Brush Works is still feeling scritchy after about a month of trying to break it in. I am thinking about getting a new knot in it. Enjoy your day and stay safe everyone!\n\n",

Last night I was finally able to get a decent shave with the SE for the first time. My face still felt a bit dry/raw, but not nearly as bad as the past 2 days, the blade was not skipping or tugging at all.\n\nI don't know what clicked, or why it was different. I did switch to a different blade, and reloaded it a few times to take pictures so there was also the possibility that I didn't have it in correctly. Or it could have been that some of the knowledge imparted stuck and figured out the angle.\n\nUsed pretty much same setup minus different blade and no need for the DE to finish this time around. Off to spend the day volunteering at Habitat for Humanity so needed a good shave going into this.\n\nHave a great day and shave everyone",

This shave was excellent. It's rare for me to have 2 straight bbs shaves because I often only aim for dfs. However, this shave was yet another after yesterday's\n\nThis brush is nice and scrubby without being scritchy. It really helps stand the whiskers at attention before the razor chops em down.",

My WTG passes were quick and smooth. I did have some trouble getting a solid ATG on my neck hollows but that's typical with a straight. Still DFS but I couldn't help but let the Alumigoose play clean up. I swapped back to the stock aluminum handle for this and oddly enough I'm actually enjoying it more, despite how weird the lack of weight feels. This Filarmonica is absolutely gorgeous though, I see what the hype is all about now.\n\nBalsamica is weird, I actually quite like it but my SO doesn't agree so I was told to cover it up... So time for my magic juice to save the day. Bon Vivant makes any morning a great morning.\n\nCheers!",

Performance was very good for sure, but I wasn't blown away or anything. Just mention that because some people have suggested it's the slickest soap out there, but I don't think it is. Still, it's really good. (small caveat - samples can be hard to use perfectly, but I felt like I got a good lather)\n\n\nThe scent though. Hmmm. I didn't dislike it, but I think I spent the whole shave with a weird expression. It's... odd. Nothing I can compare it with.

While I do have hard water my Hi Brush lathers like a champ. When I lather with my SOC it always seems like I have too much water in it. The first pass is usually pretty decent but for the second pass the lather breaks down. I have tried loading more soap in the past but it also seems to get to a saturation point where it does not pick up any more soap.\n\nIn the past I let the brush soak while I was showering so to combat the water issue today I only soaked the brush for a few minutes after my shower while getting ready. Once the brush was soaked I squeezed the water out to make sure I got as much water out as possible. I put an almond size amount of Speick in my bowl and started building my lather. While building I did add some water since I thought it needed it. The first pass as usual seemed like a decent amount of lather and it worked ok. It did leave my skin dry afterwards and not very slick. When I applied lather for a second pass it had thinned out and was unusable.\n\nFrustrated I put in a similar amount of cream (and the remnants from my SOC) in my bowl and used my synthetic to make a much better lather. I could tell a difference between the slickness of the lather from the SOC and the Omega. The lather from the Omega was much more slick.\n\nSo SOC owner's, what is your secret. How do you soak your brush? The entire brush? Just the tips? What am I missing?\n\nEdit: Wrong brush type.",

I think it's because it has been collecting dust for a bit. It is really a nice razor, if a bit mild for my tastes. It needs a sharp blade to perform to my liking, but I have a good amount of sharp blades at my disposal. Another no-nonsense shave with zero irritation. Busted out the Mike's soap - which really get little run here (or anywhere for that matter). It is really a top flight soap that can play with anyone. I don't know if Mike has ever changed his formula or not, but he hit it out of the park with his recipe. I picked Mike's up as my first artisan soap. Can't beat a classic. Great Tuesday shaves to all.",

Great shave 2 passes and called it good. ASCO blade is from tryablade.com and I was surprised how great it felt on my face. Lather was great could have done 3 passes with ease probably one of my better lathers I have gotten with this brush (it is almost broken in in my opinion). Finally figuring out how to get under my chin close, or shaved in general I had major angle issues down there. Great shave no irritation left my face feeling fresh and smooth. Hope everyone has a smooth day.\n\n\n",

This will probably be my last shave with this and I'll just pack up the rest of the sample and give it away later on. I enjoy LPV, but it's not like I'll be destroyed if I can't shave with it.. I'll probably try it again next week to make sure. At least the shave was good :p",

I don't know why though, because it's *so fucking good*. Scents aren't very strong, but the base is the balls. It's in my top 3 or 4 soaps. Does anyone have a list of all the Bufflehead soaps that have been produced? Calling /u/j-mt!\n\nI used some Chatillon Lux GLS, but had some creeper weepers that needed to be addressed, so I washed off my chin and applied some more. For the second time in a week, my wife made a comment about how strong my aftershave smelled. Last week it made her a bit queasy. The Chatillon Lux packs a punch, so you have to apply sparingly. Speaking of CL, is the Rose Yuzu scent more appropriate for warmer weather? Anyone?",

The scuttle is really nice, quite small so it fits under the counter nicely but big enough to get the lather going before I take it to my face.\n\nThe Sienna cream has been a real let down performance wise - in my eyes unless I use a shitload of it I get about the same lather as I did with the bad formula hard soaps. Thankfully i've got a stockpile of good formula Sienna hard pucks. This is my favourite scent of all my shaving shit.\n\nI like the DOC; I get good shaves with it. I wonder if the satin finish sticks to the skin more than the chrome version does.\n\nThe Romera brush is fantastic. A little less backbone than a TGN 2 band but the tips are just as soft. Fantastic brush.\n\nShave on folks, shave on!",

Today's did not go so well, I kept experiencing tugging and the blade getting stuck in some places, I was patient and made sure to stretch the skin etc. My lather was drying out and turning to custard very quickly with this soap. I added so much water back into the lather throughout the shave wow. I added a lot of water when conducting my initial lathering too. I wonder if my hard water and this soap did not agree or something? Who knows.\n\nI experienced the same problem with the DE as well after using the straight, though to a lesser extent as by this time I had determined to re-lather with more water (I palm lathered for this because my face was not happy). It was certainly more slick and easier to shave on, but man it just dried out instantly. I was adding a lot of water too.\n\nNot sure what happened here, I am going to experiment with this soap a little more without using my straight this time. I think when the straight is coming out I am just going to stick with B&M White Label soaps since I know what I am doing with those. I am going to continue fussing with new soaps only on my DE for now.\n",

I find it's intuitive and easy to maneuver. These blades that I got from Maggards blow hard though, tugging and scraping. Bleh I got one side finished and couldn't finish so I swapped over to the goose. This alumigoose has officially dethroned my S1 and I haven't even gone through my try a blade sampler. I'm still on my first blade and am absolutely in love.\n\nAlright now what you're actually interested in. P&B worth the price? Yes. The formula is very reminiscent of white label B&M. It's thirsty but gives a thick creamy lather with good residual slickness. Cushion was amazing with a better than usual post shave feel. The smells? The juniper and cedar are the main attraction with the tabacco and lather balancing it out. The scent itself is like being among juniper trees and getting whiffs of warm tabacco and leather with a slight smoke finish. There is Bergamot mentioned in the description but I couldn't detect any at this time. It's a woody scent done right. This to date is the best scent I've come across that reflects the outdoors in Arizona, my home. It's cozy as fuck. I couldn't decide between Bon Vivant or Gratiot League Square so I let the SO decide. I'll be sure to try the other very soon.\n\nI'd like to thank /u/drivenlegend for hooking me up with this Hydromatic, I very much appreciate it and hope to revisit it soon after I get some different blades.\n\nEdit: Magic not matic",

I said this yesterday but will say it again, everyone on here has been awesome offering up helpful advice or encouragement.\n\nIn my latest go with the Ever Ready, the handle seemed to not stay tight at all. I am not sure if it is stripped or anything, but it got to the point where the head started to wobble before I could even bring it up to my face. [Pics](https://imgur.com/a/Jyefg), hopefully that links the album. Is there any way to fix this or any better handles that I could swap in for this? I assume that any handles that could swap would probably have to be from a similar model. Oh well.\n\nHave a great day and shave everyone, my goal for today is to resist giving in to the 42 release!",

I'm thinking I may use a different razor each day of the June soap challenge. While I could be content using the same razor every morning, it sure is fun to switch it up.\n\nThe Ruby Green was a free sample from MLS. When I read the description of this scent I didn't think I would like it...would not have bought it based on the description. I was pleasantly surprised. It brought back memories of my grandpa's garden. Fresh and earthy...\n\nHappy Wednesday!",

All in all a great shave this morning. After having cycled through a number of different blades in my first several months of wet shaving I'm finding that I really like Feathers and Gillette Silver Blues.\n\nI received my tin of Ramos Gin Fizz yesterday after reading some rave reviews in this sub. It's even better than I was expecting. Lathered very easily and had tons of cushion. Perhaps it could have been a little slicker, but it still had plenty of glide. The smell is just perfect. I can see why many are describing it as creamsicle, but I would say the citrus is more complex than that and the background notes make for a very pleasant experience. Happy hump day!",

BUT...the splash came in yesterday, and ghost ship is by far my favorite seasonal. I'm so glad Kelly released it again for Friday the 13th a few weeks back. Such a terrific scent, three passes and a clean up pass, BBS face. The splash is phenomenal.\n\nIf you guys haven't tried it you really should do yourself a favor and get some, especially if you're a citrus lover.\n\nHave a great day guys!",

The Gargle Blaster in it reminds me a bit of *Dickens.* I think the tonique would pair nicely with that soap. I'll try it soon. I'll be using *42* a lot this summer. A+, /u/bostonphototourist; this shave was a lot like having my stubble smashed out by a slice of lemon wrapped round a large gold brick.\n\nSpeaking of smashing stubble, after a nice conversation that I had with /u/moogooguydan on Sunday, and another with /u/old_hiker and /u/hawns yesterday, I decided to break out my Schick I2. I was working on 3 days' growth because I wanted to wait until this morning to shave with *42,* but the I2 glided it through it effortlessly and provided a 2-pass BBS shave.\n\nEnjoy your shaves, all! I'm off to Milliways for some of That Old Janx Spirit.",

As it turns out, I can't draw for shit, so I procrastinated on it like a mofo after screwing up the first few drawings. I finally decided that I would turn an example to explain what I had in my head, because that was much easier than drawing.\n\nSmash cut to last week and he has an interpretation of what I've made out of resin, programmed up and ready to go.\n\nThen last night I get this beauty in the mail and I couldn't be more impressed.

Then /u/Old_Hiker mentioned a coworker that uses a straight on his head.\n\nWell ... just for kicks, I tried a WTG pass with the straight I used yesterday. I usually go ATG/XTG on the first pass with a safety razor. WTG never gets enough hair mowed down in the more dense areas of my head (sides and back). The straight was no different, leaving quite a bit of stubble. But I don't know if I want to try going right into a ATG pass with a straight. And I still have no idea how to get behind my ear while stretching the scalp and folding my ear down.\n\nMeh. I finished the shave with a 1914. At least there wasn't blood or irritation ... so that's a win. And any shave with Ruby's Green is a great shave. But I don't foresee another head shave attempt with a straight.",

Love the handle and the knot has been really nice.\n\nI'll post better pics of that and the Fatboy restore soon. So happy with both of them. Might actually sell my ATT heads since I just get a better (more comfortable) shave with the Fatboy.\n\nAll these products are amazing, yadda yadda. Hope everyone is having a good day.",

Will take a bit to get used to how light the razor is, but I got as smooth of a shave from it as from any of my other razors.\n\nThe Fine Santal Absolut is pretty much indistinguishable from the AoS sandalwood cream I used before. I never tried the AoS tallow version, which this is supposed to be based on. I need to use a different bowl or container for this soap, though. The one I used has about an 1/8 inch gap around the puck and the lather builds in there instead of coming off the puck.",

Fantastic face feel that is not drying at all. A \"well done\" to both artisans. Skipped yesterday's shave, so 2 days growth to go through. No issues except for one tiny weeper that was above my jawline, so must have been an imperfection on my otherwise flawless grill (*rolls eyes*). Great start to my \"Friday light\" or \"pre-Friday\".

I think it was a mistake to compare it performance wise to tabac. That created a certain expectation. My first thought is, meh. The scent is good, the performance is ok. It's not bad by any means, it's just not shockingly good. I need to give it another go, this time with a blade I use regularly and less of a preconceived notion of what it will be like.\n\nHave a great day!",

This is a pretty sweet razor - really nice crisp jimping, gorgeous spinework, nice looking scales, nice tight pinning. Measures 11/16 like nominally-5/8 new production razors from Solingen tend to. I do find the scale shape to be a little bit bulky while stropping, but nothing too awkward. The sound while stropping was pretty loud - more like an extra hollow than the full hollow that Dovo markets this razor as.\n\nThe shave proper went about how I would expect for a coticule edge - tuggy but nigh impossible to cut myself with. I had almost five days' growth going in, and the sound was really loud - somewhere between the classic butterknife-on-burnt-toast with the volume turned up and fabric tearing. I wound up doing a third cleanup pass with my Baurmann 11/16 (the first time I've done three passes in months) and ended up close to a BBS.\n\nNot sure whether I'll touch the Pearlex up with my Takashima iromono jnat on water or on with my Nakayama on tomo slurry.\n\nAside - TSS shipped the package as priority mail 2-day rather than regular first-class mail. I asked them if this was a new thing they were doing, and the reply I got was that they have always done it for larger orders. Nice to know.",

The menthol in the proraso preshave was relatively mild compared to everything else. This was my first use of Cryogen. This stuff is no joke. Almost like shaving with Vicks Vaporub. Cold to the point of making my eyes water. There were a couple times where I was literally tearing up, but didn't want to wipe my eyes for fear of getting lather in them. And then finishing off with the Stirling glaical was the icing on the frigid cake. Not a great scent (straight black licorice), but I was gifted a sample, and use it occasionally just for the cold. My face was nearly numb for about 15 minutes after this shave.",

I was fortunate to pick up a sample of their Integrity (unscented) which on it's own smells gross. Like really blah. Performance is top notch though. I love the size of sample; it's a nice little square; I just plopped it into an old LAASCo tub and it's perfect. Lasts forever too, it's had maybe 5 shaves on it and still looks like it did the day I got it. My only knock on SC is that the post shave isn't as nice as Caties or H&V, etc.\n\nSince I don't like the lack of smellz, I spritzed on a couple pumps of Guerlain Vetiver and let it stew for a couple of days; it masks the unscented scent but I don't really smell any GV. My favourite combo so far has been this soap and Burberry London. I love the scent of Burberry London and this soap soaks it up nicely. Shaving with it is great and no irritation or anything. A few pumps of BL gives me at least 3 nice smelling shaves.\n\nI'm really liking the 610; I think it's broken in now - it's makes great lather, as good as my higher end badgers.\n\nThe MR1 is my favourite economical razor; with a Personna Red it can take on the best of them.",

He seems to have a thing for the leather-chypre powerhouses of ye olde (*Aramis*, *Azuree*, *Bandit*, *Bel Ami*, *Cabochard*) and likens *Aramis* to a more masculine and unspoiled *Cabochard*.\n\nTo me, this smells old. Old isn't necessarily bad, if you spin it with words like distinguished, vintage, or classic. It's definitely a bomb of a scent though, good for entering a boardroom and announcing your arrival from 10 feet away. In the vein of the powerhouse chypres of the mid-late 20th century, you get a big blast of oakmoss and patchouli, but also front-ended with that fresh aldehyde component. I don't have a great nose for aldehydes yet but this is pretty unmissable. The leather is a nice touch too, kind of dialing up the masculinity to 11.\n\nThis is a suiting perfume to me, probably more appropriate with a wide peak-lapeled pinstripe Wall Street look than a slim-cut and narrow-tie set. Feels like you're wearing your own herald, who will go out in front of you to make your presence known.",

I'd like to think that somehow my Super Speed knows I put a Gillette blade in it and gets excited to shave with one of it's kin. First time using the Lucky Tiger Aspen. I enjoyed the scent and post shave feel so much I didn't feel the need to use anything else. Work is slow but I don't care. Sushi happy hour with a lady friend tonight.

Used MLS Kraken (old base) and man oh man. Could have shared the slickness with someone else and still had enough for myself. I haven't even tried their new base yet though this tub of kraken is almost done as I'm seeing a void in the middle of the tub now. Fantastic shave once again. I've been really on it lately. Couple weeks back I used my new to me Gillette Vintage for the first time. Used it for like two weeks straight and I feel that it helped me improve my skill for sure as I've transferred some of those skills to other razors and I'm getting better results. I'm shaving everyday cause my skin can handle it now which I wasn't able to do in the past and boy am I loving it.\n\nHappy shaving everyone!",

Whom does it serve?](http://i.imgur.com/YwZdcH8.jpg?1)\n\n+ Razor: **Aristocrat #16**\n+ Brush: **Paladin PK-47**\n+ Soap: **B&M Cologne Russe**\n+ Aftershave: **B&M Cologne Russe**\n+ Blade: **Kai**\n\nI've been chasing an Aristocrat #16 for over a year now--searching BST threads, the Bazaar & receiving daily updates from eBay. I suppose the #16 is as close as I've had to a \"Grail razor\". They're not exactly difficult to come by--nothing like a Toggle or a Double Ring--but examples in this condition are quite rare. And prices are usually quite high on this razor my friends, usually topping $300 for a rhodium version in great shape.\n\nBut it's hard to commit to such a cost without even having used the razor, so I was very fortunate when a friend loaned one (as well as a #21) to me a couple of months ago. That experience convinced me the cost is justified. Not only is it a beautiful razor with rich history and excellent craftsmanship, it also shaves *really* well. It occupies the comfort/efficiency sweet spot.\n\n*It is so choice. If you have the means, I highly recommend picking one up.*\n\nCologne Russe was my first B&M splash. Both I and my wife love the stuff. I'd been looking forward to buying some when it's released this year, but then I saw some on the Bazaar for a good price, so here it is. I've had 7 B&M soaps and 3 aftershave splashes, but this is my first pair. And they do pair very well together. As I said, I'm quite fond of the CR scent and there isn't much difference between the splash and soap in terms of smell. The soap performance is great (as usual) and the post-shave feel of the splash is a nice balance of alcohol burn and witch hazel buzz.",

Was happy to see Maggard's snag more tubs of Strop Shoppe, which gave me to opportunity to snag tubs of Teakwood and Baker Street. Now that I have a couple pucks of Fine's shave soap (Platinum and L'Orange Noir) coming, I'm taking a break from buying anything new until I actually make it through a few tubs of soap. I'm pretty sure at this point I've spend more money on shaving supplies in the last couple years than I have for the previous 20. Time to start putting those dollars towards new computer gear.",

When this brush comes up in rotation I usually use a hard milled soap. Last minute substitution today. I was planning on using SV Dolomiti, but I just felt like having that MWF post shave feel. I get why people don't like to fool with it, but if you work through the bubbly, messy stage, you can get an incredibly rich lather.\n\nI've got 24 shaves on this edge and it's still getting it done with no sign of slowing down. I've been using safety razors on the weekend, but I may weaken this weekend and stay with the straights.\n\nIf I have time this weekend, I'd like to finish prepping the handles that are going to be getting some new knots. I don't really want to get rid of all the patina on the handles, but I do want to get them thoroughly cleaned and lightly buffed. Off to it one more time.\n\nEdit: I can't spell",

This shave with the Schick was even better than the first now that I'm getting it dialed in.\n\nI didn't have time/energy to post it yesterday, but my shave was even better. One of the best I've had in a while. I got to use the new Catie's Bubbles formula, and god damn was it slick. I was tired and sick and the ATT H2 felt gentle as fuck. /u/c_bubbles fucking killed it with the new formula. I wasn't going to upgrade the soaps I have in the old formula, since I was under the impression that it was plenty slick, but this may have proven me otherwise. Kudos!",

I forgot how good of a shave it gives and how good it feels in the hand, and how little pressure you need to use compared to the Standard. I think I may stick with the Parker for awhile.\n\nI love Margaritas in the Arctic, that lime scent and a nice cold tingle, great for a hot summer day.\n\nTo be honest, I am just trying to use up THB Gunpowder Spice... I don't love it, and I noticed some orange/brown build up in the cap and also at the bottom of the bottle. I don't know if the metal cap is rusting or if it has just separated and needs shaken up? Maybe I should toss it out, hate to waste it though, but don't want to be rubbing rust on my face if that's what it is.\n\nEnglish Laundry Arrogant is one my favorite scents, kind of my signature scent, I wear it a lot and get a lot of compliments on it.",

I can't stop using this brush it's just so awesome. To think I this thing was only $10. It quickly whipped up an amazing creamy lather of the this glissant base.\n\nI remember when I first took Rhapsody out of the box and took a sniff I thought, uh oh what did I just buy. But when you lather that thing up and then slap on some of the splash it's just oh so great.\n\nHappy shaves everyone.",

Here's my thoughts. It's a quality performer and it smells great. It also happens to be one of my girlfriends favourite scents of all my soaps. Is it worth the price? Well that's up to the individual but my thoughts are that its a hard soap and will last a very long time. Is it better than cheaper artisan soaps? Nope, but its also not worse and I'm considering picking up the Original Vetiver soap too. I'm spending the day drinking beers and watching last night England game on catch-up given that it was on in the middle of the night for me. Have a good one everyone",

A little orange scent, a little sweet scent and cooling menthol. Perfect. The Treet worked well again, though I got a few weepers and the CFG splash burned pretty good in a few places. I'll use the Treet for one more shave.\n\nDoes anyone have an Acer Chromebook 15 and would you be willing to entertain a few questions from me? If so, please reply here and I'll PM you.\n\nEnjoy your Saturday.",

I thought I would use a few this weekend that I rarely use. I have only used this razor a few times. I should use it more because it really does shave nice. It's deceptively efficient due to its mild manners. Not as efficient as a 1914 or 1924, but it's very comfortable and easy to get a close shave with.\n\nFirst run with HeV Cognac & Cuban Cigars. I love this scent. I probably should have used one of my piggies with it since they are a known quantity. This big ass badger took up way more soap than I realized. I started out with a dry(ish) brush and kept adding water for quite a while until I ended up with enough for 6 passes. It's a good performing soap right up with the top level artisanal elite.\n\nThis AS sample from hawns is something I picked up at the meet. It's due to be released soon. I will be getting a bottle of this stuff for sure. It pairs particularly well with this soap. It has less alcohol than most AS splashes so I am able to use it a little more often than other splashes like Clubman. A weekend full of chores awaits.",

After Styptic and Alum inspection revealed that the cuts weren't the only only damage. The right side of my chin looks like hamburger. Not a great a shave.

The prewar techs are great and I'm tempted to pick up the postwar fat handle to compare with the prewars. The MR11 handle paired nicely with the tech head. it's slightly longer than the fat handle and has a nice weight to it.\n\nGrand Havana smells awesome but my gf doesn't like the scent, will have to use this when she's not around. She also stole my tub of Bali Hai so this gives me an excuse to find a new tub of soap",

Caffeinated Cream\n**Brush**: L&L Custom 24mm Envy White\n**Razor**: K1 Rhodium Slim (4) w/ Rapira Platinum Lux\n**Post**: Thayer's Cucumber, CL LFdL Toner + Nivea Sensitive Balm\n__________________________\n\nThis week, my sister FINALLY sent me my 4 leftover Rapira blades from when my mom and I visited her in New York.. like a month ago. Great shavers, no irritation, I'm definitely going to pick up the Swedish Supersteels in the future. Apparently it's going to be hot today, so I decided with Green Dragon since it's fresh-smelling and I wanted some menthol, so I added a little Pacific Shaving Co. shave cream to it; the spearmint went pretty well with Green Dragon!\n\n\nFor some reason CL toners always give me some kinda reaction (burning) that lasts a few minutes and I'm starting to doubt that it's technique-driven and more ingredient-driven; /u/hawns thinks it's probably the botanicals. I decided to mix maybe 40% toner 60% Nivea and applied it to my face to see what happens (and to mute the scent a little since my girlfriend doesn't like when scents are pretty strong lol) and no burning! Maybe the dilution brought the concentration below my face's threshold or something. Maybe I'll experiment a little and use a toner tomorrow straight up to see what happens, though my samples are starting to run out.\n\n__________________\nThis was my first morning shave in ~~a while~~ ever? I came home too late to shave last night and figured I should start morning shaves for June and I think I like it, if I have ample time. This was the only positive part of my morning; I got woken up by my dog at 7, got out of bed at 8:30 to pick up his week's worth of shit in the backyard before the gardener comes (if he comes) and I'm spending all day today and tomorrow to work on my personal statement so I can get a solid week and a half of edits in before submitting my app; I want to get it within the first week of it opening.\n\n",

Definitely has that vanilla scent, but much lighter than I was expecting. Even lathered, it doesn't quite jump out at you like other B&M soaps. Overall a good scent and the usual quality lather/slickness from B&M. This will find a permanent home in my den.",

Had some difficulties loading thanks to my 16 month old, but even so I got 4+ passes worth of lather. Said lather was, however, a lot thinner than I'm used to. Not sure if that's just the soap or the way I loaded or what, but it worked great and I'll be trying again tomorrow. Very slick, very good post shave, and the scent is spicy and woody and pleasant, though I didn't get the peace to really focus on it. And that presentation is pretty iconic in my mind. All in all, very pleased.\n\nAlso, this was my second (I think) shave back to my usual Personna Reds. I used Kai blades the last couple weeks, and while I really like them, I think they rank at second place to my Reds. I'm super relieved, because the Personnas are much cheaper, and because I very recently bought 200 of them. That Kai is a real nice blade, but though. Do recommend giving them a shot if you haven't.\n\nGetting all excited for June. Still have some stuff trickling in to flesh out my line-up. And I'm still trying to make some choices about what makes the most sense where. I missed last year, wouldn't have been able to play along anyway, and I'm getting super excited to participate.",

Capri (sample)\n\n**Balm:** Dapper Dragon Scale Polish\n\nWell today's shave was by far the closest shave I've had to date, very low irritation from this shave, however I have a lot of irritation because earlier this week I butchered my face and have not had the good sense to let my face rest, which I will be doing for the next few days. Shout out to /u/praise_the_fireborn for giving me the sample of the Folsom and Co. and for lending me the Semogue 620. Which by the way, I kinda like, it was a little stiff but I was informed it was about 60% broken in which I can believe, it did a better job than any other brush I own so there's that. I am learning after some hanging out with with a more experienced member of this community that I need a new brush haha. I have soap and aftershaves out the wazoo, it's time to save up for some better hardware I think.\n\nI really enjoyed Folsom and Co. shame they are discontinued I would like to have a few bottles in my den.",

I am pretty sure it was Sherlock which after really paying attention today I really like. Good news is my sample jar is empty in preparation for the June challenge. I don't have enough to fill the calendar but I am going to have fun with it anyway.\n\nSoap varieties, I have. Razor and Brush varieties, not so much. But after using Fine Fresh Vetiver I plan on picking up American Blend, Platinum and Santal Aboslut plus from now on when there is a soap I really like, i will most likely get the matching A/S with it as well.\n\nHope everyone has a good Saturday.",

It's a little wider than the L'Occitane Plisson set a little deeper so it isn't floppy. Shortly after I got this brush, Fine came out with their angel hair brush and the flood gates were open for inexpensive Plisson-like brushes.",

The Pushbutton probabably ties it. To be fair, they shave adequately and are comfortable. They are more mild than my favorite SEs. That might be why I don't like them as much.\n\nI have put this brush in rotation along with another synthetic I set last weekend. I prefer the nuances of natural fibers, but there is no arguing the ability of the Plisson clones to make a killer lather. I have no idea what I'm going to do about my brush rotation once I set a few more knot in the coming weeks. I like the 7 brush rotation that I established some time ago. I already feel guilty about putting a couple of brush son the bench to maintain the number at 7. However, a much worse situation is pending. Once I set the knots that are on their way from China, if I put all of the brushes I want to use in rotation, that number will be 13. I can't have that. I'll either have to bench one :( or set another knot. I kinda like the idea of the orderly nature of having a 14 brush rotation.",

The Maggard OC head is pretty damn comfortable and that glissant base is some good shit. First time reaching for the synthetic since I got my envy white and I forgot how stupid easy it was to build a good lather; better than the stuff I make with animal hair (or maybe that's the glissant's doing).. I'm pretty sure I may be a convert! My only problem with it is that I sometimes get pricked by some of the synthetic hairs when the tips are touching my face, so I can't have it splay near my mouth and I use a lot more paintbrush strokes than with my semogue (I have to do more paintbrush with the envy white cause it's so scrubby).\n\nI was supposed to test out using CL toners and use straight up toner today, but I needed Roam today; I have to go to Costco to buy shit then after I drop it off, I'm probably going to a coffee shop and get this personal statement draft done. Time's running out, I want to submit my app within a week of June 7th and I need time for people to look through it and make edits. Roam will help me power through (and make people leave me the fuck alone). Wish me luck. Happy Sunday to everyone!",

I received it as a gift from someone that's not really a part of my life anymore. Strange how little fragments of the past linger on like this. Performance is excellent; the mild scent doesn't interfere with my fragrance. To my nose the Eau Savage Parfum is a myrrh/vetiver blend with a little citrus at the opening. One spray lasts me all day and I can still detect it on my clothes for days after. Easily the best performing scent I own.\n\nGood luck to all the wetshavers out there!

We hung out with some friends by the clubhouse grill with burgers, salad, grilled asparagus, grilled pineapple, orange jello shots, a mini-keg of Oberon, and a large bottle of sangria. I should have stopped once we finished the sangria. We then decided to go out and get more alcohol downtown. Mistake. So here I am drinking tea trying to recuperate.",

Even on a blade with five shaves under it's belt, the NEW gave me such a nice shave. So close with no weepers, cuts, etc. I really like this razor.\n\nHappy Sunday!",

I'm not sure what the main factor was but it's probably a combination of becoming more comfortable with a safety razor, practice and a fresh blade. I just switched from a Derby razor to Gillette. I think I may get several different blade samples and try them out. I enjoyed the Dapper Dragon. It was a nice lather and had a nice scent.",

Very rosy, buy also green and dank. It's a really amazing warm weather scent. Highly recommended.",

Hey /u/crazindndude, did mention at one point that you had an excess of the Personna injector blades that you weren't really satisfied with?\n\nAnd *Solarion* is everything that I wished SdM was... a very nice clean, fresh floral scent suitable for any occasion. When I tried SdM it set my face ablaze for some reason. No such problem with *Solarion*. Thanks /u/ketchuegrast for the sample of the soap, and if you decide that there's no room for the jar in your den, be sure to let me know first :)\n\nEnjoy your day, and your shave.",

This soap blew me the hell away, it's been a while since I've been this impressed with a new soap. Jabonman has always been my gold standard when it came to vegan soaps but I think /u/jbisinla's new formula may be even better. The performance is outstanding and that scent is so god damn intoxicating. Again, it's been a while since I've buried my face in a tub to huff the scent. I've been on a bit of a hiatus for soap purchasing but you'd be downright silly to think I'm not ordering a tub right after I move in a few days. It'll also give me a chance to get a sample of The Black Rose, which I've been interested since its release.\n\nAlso, this brush is already incredible. The bulb gives it some real nice backbone, and the tips were already curling and gelling right out of the box.\n\nedit: Gonna head to Pasteur's today, as well!",

Not sure what the deal was on the first time. Maybe expectations, maybe just general tired/sore/crankiness.\n\nLet's talk Gamechanger. This was the 3rd full use (4th if you count a test face lather without a shave). This is an interesting knot. Visually, it fucking awesome! Good backbone which helps create a nice quick lather. The flow through was also very good. It has a bit of scrubbiness to it which I like. This one is not the softest of the modern synthetics. That said, it is also not floppy and I don't forsee it getting that dreaded donut hole I have gotten quickly with some of the pliss-like knots I've used.\n\nOverall, I like it a lot. This is a damn good knot that looks amazing. I would think the only thing some people might not like is it is not as ridiculously soft as some others. That falls pretty heavily under YMMV though. I'm going to use it as my daily driver for the next week or so and will update my thoughts.\n\nHave a good, safe Memorial Day!",

I'm able to get a nice shave with my shavette but it's going to take some practice to get good with this. It just doesn't feel sharp enough to give a close shave. Used my 40's Super Speed with a Silver Blue to clean up at the end. No cuts or irritation to speak of. Kouros is floral notes, incense, and musk. I feel like a beast wearing this one. One spray lasts 10-12 hours. The play between the natural scent of my skin and the fragrance is what get me with this one. Excellent eau de toilette.\n\nKeep a steady hand.",

Today is a straight up toner as a positive control. Tomorrow will be an experimental group as well with ~60:40 toner:Nivea. My shave tomorrow will be exactly the same as today's (besides +1 shave on the blade) to minimize number of variables. I turned the slim down one notch and decided with the synthetic to minimize any irritation I may get during the shave that could cause the burning - in retrospect, I'll probably just apply straight toner without a shave tonight or something to see if I get burning too. Hopefully this proves useful to /u/hawns - I want my order by the end of next month, dammit!\n\nI know I said I'm not a fan of lavender, but today's shave was actually pretty pleasant; maybe it's the weather. Noses are so weird, aren't they? Anyway, the shave itself was comfortable but not close, as I opted for 2 passes without a cleanup pass to avoid irritation. As far as post shave is concerned: about 10 seconds after I applied the toner, my face started to feel warm. When I say that the toners cause my face to burn, it's more like that sting from alcohol - after the application the warmth turned itself up to the previously mentioned sting (which lasts for maybe 5 seconds). It seems like it's localized around my mouth (moustache and goatee area) and the edge of my cheekbones (where the edge of my lather ends up). Soon after, the burning subsides and those areas are left really warm, though I don't see much noticeable redness in those areas. 5 minutes later, there's a faint remnant of the burning left. 10 minutes later, I don't notice it anymore.\n\n/u/hawns had the initial hypothesis that it may be due to the lanolin concentration and I may have a mild sensitivity to it - apparently lanolin concentrations in soaps and his salves are a much lower concentration. As a result, I ended up buying samples of all 3 products in Y/R/P - if the splash doesn't burn and the toner does, I guess I'm sensitive to lanolin, since that seems to be the biggest difference between the two.\n\n_____________________\nTotally unrelated, but I finally got my damn personal statement typed out! The bad news is that it's about 1300 characters over the limit so I need to trim it down today before I send it out for people to tear it apart :P Happy Memorial Day everyone; let's not forget about the honorable sacrifices our brothers and sisters in arms gave that allows us to worry about petty shit like lanolin sensitivities and school apps.",

ABORT!](https://m.popkey.co/de645d/b0zkj.gif)\n\nThat's what I said after the first pass as to not cause any further damage..\n\n-**Prep**: Washed face with WF365 and cold water\n\n-**Razor**: Merkur 34C + Gillette 7 O' Clock SS\n\n-**Brush**: Razorock Plissoft\n\n-**Lather**: SdM Donkey Milk Shaving Soap\n\n-**Post**: Fine American Blend to help get the skin back in shape for tomorrow.\n\nSo yeah. Rough morning. I went to use this soap for the first time today. This was my first time using such a hard soap. Right from the get, loading the brush did not go as well as I would have liked it too. Then during the first pass slickness was at an absolute minimum. I decided to end the shave right there. I was feeling an ever so slight irritation on my neck and I told myself it wasn't worth it to continue and possibly make it a bad day for my face. I shaved yesterday so it wasn't like I had to shave today, just had a little stubble and felt like going at it.\n\nA few hours later I decided to grate the soap which is something I've heard people do with soaps this hard. Grated it into a MWF bowl (MWF is sitting untouched in a drawer till SdM is done). I did a test of loading up a brush after grating it and that went great so I'll give it another shot in the morning. Don't expect any issues now that I've went ahead and grated it. I'll definitely do that with MWF once I get to that too as I can see that's one really hard puck of soap as well. The hardest soap I've used to date was probably Soap Commander which isn't even all that hard so yeah, I was dealing with a whole different beast of soap hardness today.",

I took my time given I had the day off work. I completed two passes, WTG and XTG. The Ladas blade was very similar to the Vokshod blades. I had one nick on my chin, and some irritation on my neck which is pretty normal since I'm still figuring out the grain. However, my resulting irritation was several razor bumps rather than the bright overall redness I've experienced my last couple of shaves.",

Wife has been against it, mostly because of required shaving maintenance. I said screw it and used my Wahl clippers without a guard and took everything off. She doesn't hate it.\n\nIn other news, people have talked enough about Ruby's Green. Just go buy it. It's amazing. Sweeter than I thought with a hint of pepper to my nose when lathered.\n\nThe short comb is such a great razor. I really need to get my hands on a long comb to try. I also discovered for certain that I am a 2-band/Finest guy. Silvertip is just too floppy for me. The ACE I have feels like I'm lathering with a wet piece of toilet paper. I should replace that knot and just get another FS Finest.",

Holy shit, does not disappoint. It's also the first of the Latha line Ive tried and cannot believe the price point it's been set at.\n\nAs far as a mini review goes, off the puck you get a mix of the lemon, orange (probably more so than others) and a small hint of rose. During the lather, lemon and rose become much more prevalent. I wouldn't say it's a very strong scented soap, but not under-scented either.\n\nI was impressed with how quickly it loaded as well, which I guess is by design for a new learner. The lather seemed to hold a good deal of water, which I tested on the second pass. I usually just dip the tips of my brush into my mug of hot water as my method of adding water to the lather. Usually 2 dips get you to the point right before the lather becomes runny, this was at that point after 4-5 dips. Anyway, enjoy your Monday's folks.",

      "body": "**Feather, Finally**\n\n+ Razor: Gillette Aristocrat #16\n+ Brush: Paladin PK-47\n+ Soap: MLS Reunion\n+ Aftershave: Fine Clean Vetiver\n+ Blade: Feather\n\nIt was Memorial Day weekend and I am a devout observer of the First Law of Holiday: **Thou Shalt Not Shave**. I had a good 3 days of growth and IME that's the real sweet spot for wet shaving--any more and clogging may occur, any less and the threat of irritation and nicks increases.\n\nI'm entering week 2 with the Aristocrat. Man, this is such a great razor. Aesthetically it's beautiful--the functional design, great proportions and shiny rhodium work together to make this among the most beautiful DE razors ever made. (*Don't tell my Wolfman I said that.*) It's not just good looking either. It's the most intuitive razor I've used in terms of finding the proper blade angle. The weight is nice and hefty and the handle is a good length for pinkie resting. Again, great fucking razor. Get one if you can.\n\nI'm getting along really well with the Reunion. It took me a while to find out what scents work for me. Currently, my two favorite soaps based on scent along are Leviathan and this one. The green vetiver really opens up with the lather and it pairs very well with Fine's ~~Clean~~ Green Vetiver.\n\nFeathers are a legendary--some would say infamous--blade. I've tried them in every razor I've owned and, without fail, every time I used one I looked like I was in a Vincent Price movie. Not the case with the Aristocrat--at least not with 3 days of growth. My usual 2.5 pass shave yielded BBS all around. (I usually end up with BBS face, DFS neck.) Even this morning (I shave at night) in the shower it felt nearly BBS. I hope the results are the same with 1 day of growth.",

It felt cooling to my skin, whether that's all in my head due to Arizona ramping up the heat of not, I'm not sure. The SO noticed that my legs weren't as moisturized as with the Lavender Lizard, but I'm wondering if it's due to the second rinse I did. Either way, /u/eighchops' brush was impressive. The size and shape were pleasing (I do have large hands for a lady, ring size 9 for comparison) and while the tip was soft, it had a delicious backbone. Most folks who have seen it love the design, as do I and the packaging... Oh goodness, the packaging. I'm a sucker for great packaging, and C&R are by far one of the best I've seen, from private to mainstream products. I love me some awesome packaging.\n\nOn another note, I mentioned that my SO's grandparents found me a shaving stand and cup. [Here is a picture of what all came with it](http://i.imgur.com/onJB6hB.jpg), but there are no makers marks of any kind. I did use it yesterday and found that marble holds heat well. It's also a gorgeous piece to sit on my counter. Any ideas?\n\nHappy Tuesday! Any one else get a short week too?",

My shaves have been terrible this trip (I still don't know why-I'm worried I somehow screwed up my Schick G), and so I'd given up on shaving during the past 4 days. It was wonderful to get back and have that post-flying shower and post-flying shave. Since the growth on my face was crazy, I went straight for the OCMM.\n\nDamn I love this razor. Any time I can't shave for awhile, whipping this thing out allows me to remember what BBS is truly like. Three passes and I wasn't left with a hint of stubble.\n\nThe Tabac was a choice made of necessity-I actually was in the mood for Roam when I got back, but was shaving at 10 PM and about to go to sleep-and no way I'm doing Roam before I sleep. Tabac's pleasant, mild scent paired perfectly with Cologne Russe.\n\nA great shave and now it's a perfect, sunny, blue-sky day here in the North Country. Wherever you are, I hope you have a great one!",

I use the /u/leisureguy method of blade sampling and I like to use the scientific method as best as possible. So, I had my wife randomly choose a blade to remove any hype/bias from reading these forums. I'll let the shave performance tell me if the blade is good or bad. That said, this shave was equally good or slightly better than the last blade (Shark Super Stainless).\n\n*Edit: formatting*",

It seems to have given me a similar reaction yesterday. There's probably a confounding variable in that I just wanted to finish off my sample and ended up with more liquid than I would normally use, so even though the concentration was lower, the actual amount may have been about the same as yesterday's trial. Though, it seems like 7 minutes later, I don't feel the warmth whereas it went away 10 minutes later yesterday. Maybe I'll just wait for my order from /u/hawns to come to continue on with this.",

Wife told me a long time ago the aftershave was pretty strong, but I'm on the road today. What the soap lacks in face feel the aftershave makes up for. Good combo, great classic shave.",
