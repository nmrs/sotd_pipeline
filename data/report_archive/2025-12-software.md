# Lather Log December 2025

**Total Shaves:** 1,572
**Unique Shavers:** 115

Welcome to your SOTD Lather Log for December 2025

* 1,572 shave reports from 115 distinct shavers during the month of December 2025 were analyzed to produce this report. Collectively, these shavers used 528 distinct soaps from 147 distinct brands. 32 of those shaves used samples of 21 unique soaps.

* As a belated Christmas gift to you, Gentle Reader, I’ve included links to the relevant soap on the [Wet Shaving Database](https://wetshavingdatabase.com)￼wherever a matching entry could be found.

## Observations

* Christmas scents unsurprisingly dominate the top of the soaps table this month. Stirling – Christmas Eve is the clear standout, with more than twice as many shaves as runner-up House of Mammoth – Santa Noir.

* It wasn’t all holiday releases at the top, though. Fanzine Saponifications – Caravaggio (3) and Martin de Candre – Vetyver (5) both muscle their way into the top five, edging out the more obviously seasonal Noble Otter – ’Tis the Season (4) and Barrister and Mann – Vespers (6).

* Things got pretty tight in the Brand contest, with just three shaves separating the podium chasers: House of Mammoth in third (107), Catie’s Bubbles in fourth (105), and Noble Otter in fifth (104).

* After a year of trading blows over the Brand Diversity trophy, Stirling and Barrister and Mann finish the year in a dead heat for the second month in a row. Catie’s Bubbles managed to grab second place in five of the twelve months, but never quite made it to the top step of the podium. Here’s how the contest played out over the year; columns show unique scents (and that brand’s position for the month):

**Monthly Wins:**

* In the Soap Diversity by User contest, u/Environmental-Gap380 and u/brokenjaw622 both post perfect months. u/SamIAmShepard also managed a one-soap-per-shave run, but missed a couple of days, so he has to settle for bronze.

## Notes & Caveats

* Tables show all entries with 5 or more shaves to provide comprehensive coverage without artificial row limits.

* The unique user column shows the number of different users who used a given brand/soap/etc in the month.

* The Brand Diversity table details the number of distinct soaps used during the month from that particular brand, showing all brands with 5+ unique soaps.

* The change Δ vs columns show how an item has moved up or down the rankings since that month. = means no change in position, up or down arrows indicate how many positions up or down the rankings an item has moved compared to that month. n/a means the item was not present in that month.
