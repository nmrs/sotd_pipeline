# Brush Scoring Configuration
# This file defines the scoring weights for different brush matching strategies and their modifiers
#
# Strategy Modifiers Explained:
#
# Composite Brush Strategies (automated_split, full_input_component_matching, known_split):
# - multiple_brands: Awarded when the strategy detects multiple brands in handle/knot components
# - handle_brand_without_knot_brand: Awarded when the strategy detects a handle brand without a knot brand
# - handle_weight: Multiplier for handle matching score (base + priority) - SHOULD BE 0
# - knot_weight: Multiplier for knot matching score (base + priority) - SHOULD BE 0
# - high_confidence: Awarded when the strategy uses high-priority delimiters (w/, with, in) (automated_split only)
# - dual_component: Awarded when the strategy successfully matches both handle and knot components (full_input_component_matching only)
#
# Component Strategies (handle_matching, knot_matching):
# - fiber_match: Awarded when the strategy detects fiber type in input text (badger, boar, synthetic, etc.)
# - size_match: Awarded when the strategy detects size specifications in input text (26mm, 28mm, etc.)
# - handle_indicators: Awarded when the strategy detects handle-specific terminology (wood, resin, metal, etc.)
# - knot_indicators: Awarded when the strategy detects knot-specific terminology (wood, resin, metal, etc.)
# - priority_score: Rewards based on handle/knot priority levels from catalog matching
# - brand_match: Awarded when the strategy successfully matches a brand pattern (regex match success)

brush_scoring_weights:
  # Base Strategy Scores:
  # - Higher base scores indicate more reliable/accurate strategies
  # - Strategies are ranked by their ability to provide accurate, complete brush information
  # - Modifiers provide additional points for specific achievements within each strategy
