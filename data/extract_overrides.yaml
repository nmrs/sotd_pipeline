# This file allows data analysts to override extracted fields when the initial extraction
# is ambiguous or incorrect, based on user feedback or manual review.
#
# Format:
# YYYY-MM:
#   comment_id:
#     field: "corrected_value"
#
# Valid fields: razor, blade, brush, soap
# Comment IDs are Reddit comment IDs from the source data
