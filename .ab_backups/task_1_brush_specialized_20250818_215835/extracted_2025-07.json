Harris - Sandalwood\n* **Post Shave:** Thayer's - Rose Petal Witch Hazel\n* **Post Shave:** Every Man Jack - Peppermint Aloe AS balm\n\nI walked into Harvard Square yesterday at lunch to pick up a smoothie and walked out of Harvard Square with a smoothie and a new bowl of DR Harris Sandalwood. The DRH came from Leavitt & Peirce, an old-school store of awesomeness around the corner from the smoothie place. I'm always good to walk in there and huff the tobacco canisters. I figured I needed something to celebrate making it through the LG, or maybe I just needed to buy myself an early birthday present or maybe I just needed something to fit my alleged new user name- loudmusicgrandpa (Grrrrrrr). Sometimes we all need some bullshit excuse to buy something. Anyway, Sandalwood was an excellent choice. It's classic smelling but not in the Proraso Red way. It also has a bit of a powder note to it. Yea, it just works for me.\n\nKnow what else works for me? Black coffee. Let's do it. Try to enjoy your day and remember to be kind to one another.\n\n$Discord",

The extrait brings a lot more of the smoky and woody facets of the scent where the soap is more boozy orange. I think the aftershave serum strikes a perfect balance and went well with the cheery creamsicle orange scent of Morir Soñando. A very enjoyable combo! Have a wonderful Tuesday all!",

I also learned that two British brands, Truefitt and Hill and Simpson's also make West Indies Lime. I want to find one I like for a summer cologne. I wish SSL was a bit more Lime and Stirling was a bit spicier. Hopefully, I'll find a good one. Anybody know of any other sort of west indies lime/spicy lime type scents/even mint and lime and spice type frags or soaps?\n\nYou know what I'm realizing...I'm wrong to be thinking of Sea Spice Lime as in this category of \"Lime and Spices.\" It's lovely and even very special, but it is something else. Something more cologne like, more fragrance like. Lime is there, but this is truly something else. Perhaps in a category unto itself. Something I may end up buying the frag of, but not in place of something like Stirling's West Indies Lime or Royall Lyme. Sea Spice Lime continues to grow on me, and taking the pressure off of \"well, do I get this or that one for this category?\" may just end up with me getting to purchase it as an EDP.\n\nHappy Canada Day to our Friends from Up North!\n\nHave an awesome day, friends!",

It's nice to have the day off even though the day started with mowing the grass. I've also discovered that the strawberries that hide under the tall grass have been spreading; it's sad to run the mower over them, and I'm not sure if they like being sheltered by the grass or if they prefer more sunlight from shorter grass cover. Luckily they are pretty low to the ground so most of them should survive the mower. Wild strawberries taste far better than the giant grocery store ones that are still white inside (aka underripe). If you haven't had fresh, proper farm strawberries, you're missing out!\n\nCanadian soap, splash, and EdP; the combination earned the much coveted \"you smell good\" from my wife. Used the Weck today and it's a really great razor; shame they didn't catch on, but at least they pivoted to hair shapers so the blades are readily available from barber supply shops. They are a good midpoint between straights and safety razors; the thicker blades are closer to a straight edge compared to a DE blade. Nicked myself slightly in the same spot on my neck as before, but it could have been a scab layer that I peeled off; I'll need to be more careful. I believe the Personna blade is probably a tad bit sharper than the Fromm blades. But my face is BBS.\n\nShared from [My Shave Den for iOS](https://apps.apple.com/app/1581646387)",

I'm probably more likely to take my full-size Tech on vacation, but the tiny Tech might be nice when I'm really trying to pack small and once I make a nice tiny travel case for it. For now it's just fun to use and shaves great.\n\n🪒 Many Happy Shaves! 🪒",

Spiced. As far as Old Spice type scents go, it seems to be a very nice and complex one. It is probably what I would recommend to a person if they asked me for a very nice old spice scent. However, it just isn't for me. I just don't get along with the creamy vanilla, tonka bean thing in those scents. I also don't mean any disrespect, but I can definitely see why Old Spice was marketed to women when it first came out in 1937. The spices fade, the cream and sweetness remain.\n\nI'm a bay rum and a Tabac man, for sure. I'm glad I learned that and can close that chapter (and enjoy those soaps every once in a while). Actually, I might just be comfortable enough to say that Tabac is the soap and scent for my \"Old Spice\" Category. Perhaps u/cowzilla will not approve, but I think Tabac and Spiced were both attempts to compete with Old Spice anyway?\n\nI am going to keep working especially with Sea Spice Lime smush pretty intensively because that scent is really growing on me and I am almost certain I will purchase it as an EDP. I think it really helped that I separated SSL in my mind from Stirling's West Indies Lime. SSL is something special.\n\nI saw that Spearhead used to offer bath soaps. I wish they would again. I would certainly purchase sea spice lime as a bath soap. It is really nice that it is available as an EDP because that is how I want it, to last all day. Spearhead is a quality company and I'm eager to support them. The fact that his daughters helped him design two perfumes is very touching.\n\nThank you to u/partyman97_3 for sending me a smush of Spiced and Sea Spice Lime.",

I use the Rescue Potion and Aftershave Serum every day. I do prefer alcohol based aftershaves though so I'm not really a fan of the Recovery Splash. Can't win 'em all I guess. The Green Label splash and Viride made a nice follow up from Bon Monsieur so I'm smelling and feeling great on this last work day before a long holiday weekend. Have a wonderful Wednesday all!",

I was too late to pick up a full tub, but I think the two samples I have will be enough to enjoy the soap while actually having a chance of using it up some day (I'm running out of space for all my shave soap) . The scent was pleasant and the soap performed perfectly, just as you'd expect for the Tusk base. The Leather aftershave is really a beautiful scent - I'm glad I picked it up when it was available.\n\nAnother day with the Tiny Tech. It's a good shaver but maybe a bit inefficient. I'll try a Kai blade tomorrow and see if that helps.\n\n🪒 Many Happy Shaves! 🪒",

As it's typical for European cream, it has lots of cocos nucifera oil in it. Like expected, it lathered very easily and could take a good portion of water.\nIt's scent is a combination of black licorice and rum. The rum component gives a warmth to the scent, but tones down the licorice.\nScent wise, it's pretty good, but I hoped for a more clear licorice scent. With a 8€ price tag, it was a worthy experiment.\nSpeaking of the price tag. I did not expect the highest lather quality and am correct.\nThere was very little glide and sickness. I guess I would place it below Goodfellas smile performance wise. You get what you pay for.\nLuckily, it's still a good shave.",

Prospect Creek is pure peppermint essential oil (no added menthol). Give Mystic Water a look. She also ships to Canada and Internationally for a good price.

Stropped it prior to the shave and the blade felt good. However started getting absentminded and did something I wouldn't normally do and got quickly brought back to reality when I felt the feeling of sharp metal against skin. Thankfully I stopped it before it cut deep, and the Osma seemed to have stopped the cut. I'm also glad I mellowed the edge a bit on a Jnat because the original edge would have cut deeper.\n\nLesson: Don't start thinking of other things when shaving with a straight razor.\n\nI smell like incense and cardamom this morning. It's not the closest shave because I stopped after the second pass and didn't do any touch ups. But actually now that my skin has dried it's better than I thought it was. A bit shy of a DFS. I'm getting more used to the larger length of the Moarteen, and I quite like the gentle smile it has; makes it easier to shave my neck. The massive width of the blade and thick spine also made for a quicker shave since I only needed to rinse off the blade about half as often.\n\nTotally forgot about Theme Thursday after all the Lathergames shenanigans. The events in Tianamen Square were in June 1989 I thought; still, a very significant event of protest, defiance, abuse of power and resilience. I may be able to retroactively apply my shave to the theme, but it doesn't hold a candle to what those brave souls, especially the man known as \"Tank Man\", did. The open blade of freedom and defiance of safety and the way of going with the flow of the masses, the \"passion\" in Passion Incense, and the story of Orfeo's defiance and resilience going into Hades to retrieve his love (though it also ends in tragedy).\n\nShared from [My Shave Den for iOS](https://apps.apple.com/app/1581646387)",

I didn't have any set expectations prior to my first use a couple of days ago. Some of the more \"mainstream\" barbershop scents lean heavily towards the sweet powder or fresh citrus ideas. This is not that. Instead, it is complex and leans toward the warm side - but not so warm that it can't be an everyday day scent year around.\n\nTime for coffee.\n\nFace WTG ATG.\nNeck WTG WTG.\n\n$discord",

The short handle made it easier to finesse the razor and get the most out of its efficiency. The end result is the smoothest shave I've had in months.\n\nJárnviðr is a sample I picked up in my pre-Lather Games Maggard's order. The description of the fragrance sounded great.

This was purchased as part of a pre-order, but I did not think there was much risk. The scent is a fresh aquatic and perfect (IMO) for a hot summer day. This soap has a new soap base called Cashmere. I found it quite nice, especially for straight razor shaving.\n\n[video](https://youtu.be/sxirSNHRl3Q)\n\n$discord",

Freedom from having to match the themes. I kept things light and summery today. As a kid summer = freedom. Those days around Memorial Day through Labor Day were the ultimate freedom for me. Usually was in soccer, baseball, or swimming each summer, I had free rein over the town. Playing with friends, biking all over town, and just had to be home for dinner, and after dinner off again until dark. I had what they call today a free range childhood. Summery scents remind me of that.",

I hear they're coming back at some point soon?\n\nIn any case, I searched far and wide for the past year and always came up empty. I put one final call on the Bazaar recently, and I'm grateful to u/jeffm54321 for offering his Legacy to me in trade. It feels great to have it back in the den. And in your honor, Jeff, for my first shave with it I pulled out a Bay Rum set.\n\nThis one's never getting out of my sight. When all is said and done, I'll be clutching it to my breast in my casket.

I have to agree with his assessment: the scent is fantastic but the performance leaves quite a bit to be desired. I'm going to get me some of that Ogallala Bay Rum Double Strength Cologne per his recommendation. I forget who, but someone kindly pointed out that Pasteur sells smaller versions of this for a good price. It's a Bay Rum day and that is always a good day.\n\nI'm going to a local safari and going to BBQ some lovely local Cherry Honey Sausages and Hot Dogs I got. Stay safe and cool. I always hate saying this on the fourth, but I still do: This evening, a few people will go to sleep with fewer body parts than they woke up with.",

This razor is easier to live with when combined with the 7 O'Clock blade. Razor and blade really are an equal partnership. I wouldn't use this razor on the daily, but it's a nice change when I'm in the mood for a lot of blade exposure.\n\nThis is my second try with the Dr. Squatch. The fragrance is great, but I'm adding some water as I go, as this is a little thicker than I like. I'm trying to dilute it to the consistency of the Nivea. Have a great day, everyone.",

A lighter titanium handle could work wonders in the future.\n\nThe bowl itself performed flawlessly as we might expect, provided you keep the brush towards the middle of the bowl. Otherwise the lather tends to run right over the sides and directly onto your hands. Also, the \"unique\" shape demands you hold it carefully and proceed slowly, lest you drop it and spill your lather all over the floor, which can create a real headache. (You don't need a lot of brains to operate it here, just some common sense.)\n\nFor the shave I did one pass WTG, another ATG, and we're done. It's BBS time all over, no irritation.\n\nNow that's a shave which can really go to your head!\n\n\n(* The previous owner didn't have a mind to keep it on him anymore, as it were.)\n\n\\#FreedomShaves\n\n**Bonus**:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6jkBmRBR7U ← An Entire Civilization Might Be Buried Under the Sahara",

This scent has notes of \"Juicy Pineapple, Sea Salt, Wood Smoke, Charred Cedar, Fig, and Brown Sugar.\" Definitely a winner in my book- the pineapple is really juicy and gets better once lathered when the fig also joins the party. I am regretting not getting the matching splash, but will order that too once they are back from a short break! Thanks for putting this on my radar and adding to my SAD.\n\nHope everyone has an awesome day, stay cool.",

I also want to shout out a few friends from that other sub that might find this SOTD of interest: u/lakes1964 (though he posts here too) and u/derrickhogue. Jill Lett Slim (great name), is a fan of Murray and Lanman's aftershave called \"Florida Water.\" This is a [preparation that was created in 1808 in New York](https://www.allure.com/story/history-of-florida-water) to compete with Eau de Cologne (kinda the 4711 family). I learned about it from this[ wonderful video on vintage aftershaves from the 1800s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKbl-XjOxEI). While the recipe has remained a secret, and the company claims they are still using the same recipe (though I don't know if FD&C Blue was around in 1808). Nowadays, Florida Water is popular in spirit work (I'm a Christian so I don't mess with that) and among certain communities in NYC, Miami, and the South. The scent is considered unisex.\n\nJill once described it as sort of smelling like cola. He didn't mean like pepsi, he meant like old school, kola nut, citrusy, spicy cola. It's very citrusy, floral, and soothing. While Murray & Lanman make a bath soap in this scent, they don't make an shave soap that goes with this aftershave. I found that Mystic Water (and Mama Bear) does make a Florida Water Shave Soap. [Mama Bear ](https://mamabearssoaps.com/)is an excellent artisan from northern Michigan who specializes in Glycerin soaps and has been supportive of the wetshaving community (esp. badger and blade). I am particularly passionate about supporting Mama Bear and Mystic Water as they are from that \"first generation\" of artisan soapmakers who were forgotten about after the \"base wars.\" I've talked about Mystic Water's excellent sample policy (3 1⁄2 oz soaps for $9 and that includes shipping) before.\n\nMystic Water has done an excellent job of recreating the scent in her terrific (though admittedly at times finicky base...though probably no more finicky than I found B&M or some of you found Mike's). Her Florida Water soap contains essential oils of Bergamot, Lavender, Ylang Ylang, Rosemary, Petitgrain, Cinnamon Leaf, Clove, and Jasmine. There is a tiny hint of Rose Fragrance Oil as well. I cannot recommend it enough. It is a lovely smell, especially for the summer. I encourage you to check out Murray and Lanman's Florida Water. It can be had on amazon or at Walmart for ridiculously cheap (cheaper than Clubman Pinaud cheap). And, think of it in the Clubman family really. It's that style of aftershave. Be sure to check out the shave soap from either Mystic Water or Mama Bear (the latter also does an [EDP](https://mamabearssoaps.com/index.php?main_page=index&cPath=5), lots of custom EDPs too).",

The edge didn't feel as sharp as the last shave, but it cut comfortably and my face is BBS from 3 passes. I love the look of the pistachio wood scales, especially with the diamond points; the blade etching also looks very elegant and tasteful. I'm happy to have this blade shaving well.\n\nShared from [My Shave Den for iOS](https://apps.apple.com/app/1581646387)",

My beloved Weber Genesis E-310 Special Edition that was the first new thing we bought ourselves after we moved to Chicago 13 years ago.\n\nIt has been my faithful grilling companion several times per week, just about every week of the year since I brought her home and excitedly put her together.\n\nShe made many a steak dinner as I did dates at home with my wife, cooked up a LOT of chicken during our many attempts at being healthy, and for the last seven years has helped feed two growing kids who really, really like hot dogs.\n\nBut time marches on, and the baked on finish on the cart has started to succumb to the ever-present humidity here in the Midwest. I'd guess I have the rest of this summer and maybe next before it's no longer structurally sound, and the parts to fix it are not reasonably priced, sadly.\n\nSo, I figured I wouldn't have to buy another for 10 more years, but it looks like that's not the case. I hope the replacement lasts as long and makes as many good meals as this one did.",

I would still purchase the non-green, but it's so fun! The WS-23 cooling provides a nice chill, perfect for summer. I think this is one of the few times I'm regretting not buying the full trifecta right away as I love how juicy the lime note is. Just want to pay for shipping 3 times I guess. Waiting for the splash to arrive, but also still need to get the full bottle of the fragrance - for now will enjoy the sample, so at least there's that!\n\nHope everyone has a fantastic Sunday!",

It's an exclusive for Pasteur. It is a very tropical with pineapple being the strongest note I get. I decided to pair it with Executive Man/Aventus to pick up the pineapple there. Definitely tames the very sweet scent from the soap. I think next time I'll use it with SBS Day Dream or NO Monoi de Tahiti. Lather was great. MacDuff's makes some great shave soap.",

It's not as soothing as Zingari Man or Stirling balms/serums so likely won't reach for it again until I forget.\n\nGot a good lather out of the Fanchurian. I'm slowly learning its mysteries. Third and final shave with the CC. I'm beginning to get cocky with the OTSR and try the fool's path. Went better than expected but definitely need a sharp ass sharp blade to pull that off.

I don't expect to hear anything before tomorrow, so today I have another interview scheduled for this afternoon.\n\nI have been blogging on LinkedIn, in my field of expertise, for the past couple of months, and it has raised my profile and I am getting noticed more, but that only takes one so far.\n\nToday's shave is Cannonball. One of my earliest purchases from SBS, and still one of my favorites. I'm still trying to figure out what to use for AA, and this would work well, and likely kill the tub. I won't replace it, as I have Rope Swing to use when this is gone.\n\nTwo passes, plus a little neck buffing to catch the stuff there that the other two passes missed.\n\nHave a great week, be kind to one another.

Just life getting in the way, I guess. Hope everyone's doing well!\n\nBack in January I applied for a job with a really cool company that is great with their employees. I have a few friends that have moved over and they love it. When I applied, interviews went really well, and I was expecting a call in March with the final decision. I was told (and have no reason to believe otherwise) that I was their #1 pick, but relocation was basically a requirement.\n\nNo can do.\n\nThis being the case, I was a little bummed, but still optimistic. They did say they'd be ready for remote positions in December 2025/January 2026. My current job has me on rotating shift work so my sleep is shit (avg 4 hours a day for months at a time), but last year they changed their MJ/THC policy. Since I knew I wouldn't need to clean up for the other job until fall, I figured I'd try to get some sleep in the interim. I tried it, and it didn't really even help, so I gave up on it.\n\nWouldn't you know, two weeks after my last dose, I get a call from the new company wanting me to start FAST. Like, \"we're growing so fast we have early approval to give you WFH, your offer letter is ready, and you'll start in two weeks\" fast. I let them know the situation with the sleep aides and my soon-to-be boss said it wasn't a concern, and they'd take care of it.\n\nSo I went and took my pre-employment tests and didn't worry about it.\n\nWell...as it turns out, she wasn't fully informed, and the fact that it's not a problem doesn't mean it's *actually* not a problem. So now I'm back on the original timeline of December, since I have to be clean for 6 months in order for DISA to clear me from their database after some drug counseling and testing clean. They did assure me that they're holding the position for me and not to worry. But man, I was looking forward to getting some sleep and family time.\n\nOh well. Guess I learned my lesson in a few different areas.",

I ordered a defective brush that was listed at 22mm. Today I measured the opening of my Yaqi Timber Wolf (sic) that's listed at 26. The handle opening is 26mm. I measured my Omega that's listed at 25mm and the handle opening is 25mm. Finally, I measured the handle opening on my Yaqi defect, and it turned out to be a 25mm opening. I knew it felt too much like my Omega to be 3mm smaller. No way. I'll be referring to this as a 25mm from now on.\n\nSecondly, I decanted a bit of Clubman Bay Rum this morning. I've seen several others here do the same. I've never felt that there was anything wrong with the scent of the bay rum, but I'm willing to try anything once. I had an empty Nivea Post Shave bottle that I rinsed out for this purpose. I don't know if I'm supposed to smell a difference right away or what. We'll see how it goes.",

She really shines with her wide variety of scents. I cannot think of (and perhaps you might and will share with me) a scent like \"orange spice tea.\" This one is light, fruity, got a touch of vanilla, and just a tiny bit spicy. According to Michelle, orange spice tea is an \"Astringent and refreshing black tea scent warmed with vanilla, orange peel essential oil, and just the right amount of spice: nutmeg, clove and cinnamon leaf.\"\n\n[The link ](https://www.mystic4men.com/)has a list with descriptions of all the scents, but there are a few I want to highlight for some of you fine folks.\n\nJeff's Lavender is a lavender blend with Bulgarian and French Lavender and a lavender absolute. Green Fairy recreates the scent of absinthe. Cool Water is a dupe. If you love Irish Tweed, she has Irish Traveller. Lot of herbal options we don't often see (e.g. tea tree, lily of the valley, lilac, violet), various roses and sandalwoods. She even has several she has created throughout the years.\n\nAs always, you can try three 1⁄2 oz pucks for $9 (includes shipping). Or, as I was saying to someone yesterday when I discovered yet another amazing soap company and I have far too much shave soap, try it as a bath soap to get the scents. Get you some of that goodness.\n\nHave an awesome Tuesday, Friends. Stay Cool!",

Each fragrance is great on its own, but combined they are astounding. I've previously combined Shire with Just Right for a Tuesday, based on an SOTD post from u/pridetwo, but the I have no Shire aftershave, so the middle was missing. Roam Two fit in perfectly. The sweet grassy scent of the aftershave complemented the florals in Shire, but those disappeared almost immediately, leaving the leather and tobacco, which blended well with the tobacco in Shire and seemed to complement the florals of Just Right for a Tuesday.\n\nOn a side note . . . oh lawdy is the Fat Boy an absolute chonk of a razor. You really can just let the razor rest on your skin and do all the work as it slowly slides down your face. It's very different from the Travel Tech I used last week. It's taking a bit of getting used to, but in a good way.\n\n🪒 Many Happy Shaves! 🪒",

It's a small razor in the hand but has a good weight to it (being chromed brass). I had read about folks having issues with blade alignment on FaTips. The three post style lockup worked fine with the Feather blade. I tried wiggling the blade before assembly but I saw much less than I see with my Maggard's Slant.\n\nLo Storto had no problem mowing down two days of growth. I also shaved the back of my head to touch up the bald fade I get at the barberella (single pass ATG).\n\nFinally, I'm adding the Proraso powder into my normal rotation. It does a great job at taking the shine out.\n\nHave a great day!",

Kiawah is pleasant but uninspired, like a too-expensive hand soap my mother in law might buy.\n\nShore and High Seas are a good match as usual.\n\nWishing everyone a pleasant evening.

My drivers license expires later this month, so I'm off to go get in line at the local office. I have an appointment at another place, 2 hours away, but I'm not crazy about making the drive.\n\nThe biggest challenge is that I don't have a Social Security card. I haven't needed it in 40 years, so I didn't bother to replace it. I have tax returns, my DD-214, and my VA Loan documents that have it printed on there, but 1099s and W-2 don't print the full number anymore.\n\nSince I am out in public today I wanted a light, non offensive scent, so grapefruit fills the bill. The razor is a great every day driver and is on the medium side aggression wise. I have been using these 5 O'clock Blacks for years. It's a sharper blade, and performs better for me in a milder razor. Tomorrow or Friday I will go back to a Persona. 3 passes with neck buffing.",

This one is very similar to Bon Monsieur, but there is a greener aspect to it and a hint of mint that is really nice and sets it apart. I way overloaded and had trouble getting enough water into this dense lather, but still had a nice shave from it. Great smells for a cooler and humid rainy summer day. Have a great Wednesday all!",

The edge feels odd, but I can handle it very well and get great shaves with it.\nAfter the shave, I realized that the bottom of the tub shines through the remaining soap. Soon, I ll have a ring of death and will miss the soap. To my luck, Manna di Sicilia is pretty close, scent wise and looks barely used.",

Coffee bean scented soap was appropriate. It feels like it should be Friday. Poire Française smells good, goes with just about anything, and was on my counter so that's what I used with it. Made a ton of lather so I went with a third pass; doesn't make a huge difference with the Overlander. Good shave though. Now to power through the day with coffee.\n\nShared from [My Shave Den for iOS](https://apps.apple.com/app/1581646387)",

Looking forward to getting to know it better, and maybe doing some blade experimentation, though the Feather Pros have typically been my favorite blade for AC razors.\n\nMike's had been getting a lot of talk in the sub lately, so I ordered some. I used to have a few Mike's, back about 10 years or so ago. I always liked it and the OCPB was my favorite scent. But back then I was always looking for the next big thing, and thought at the time that I needed to sell something to buy something, so I sold them off one by one. It's good to have it back, it really is quite a nice soap.\n\n$Discord",

No irritation with just one nick on my neck. Just a shave with frugal products such as the soap, brush, and splash. They all won't break your bank. The lesson here is that you don't have to use luxurious products to get a good shave. I've said it before, even budget products can still give you a good shave.

I figured for $7/puck, why not? I it was horrible, I could just toss it and move on, and if it was good then I got a deal on some cheap soap.\n\nThe scent notes for Matsuyama from the Web site are \"Mandrin rind, geranium, light musk\" and the ingredients are \"home rendered tallow, stearic acid, coconut oil, castor oil, shea butter, vegetable glycerin, coconut milk, bentonite clay and fragrance.\"\n\nIt's a softish soap (a \"croap\" I guess some call it), so was easy to smush into a 3\" plastic tub and use today. The results were good, like really good. The mandaran orange scent was front and center - the other notes were there, but just as backup. It lathered up quickly, took about the right amount of water, and provided the slickness and protection that I'd expect from a shave soap. I look forward to trying the Cypress and Jakarta (sandalwood) soon.\n\n🪒 Many Happy Shaves! 🪒",

What a shave!\n\nYou know how Stirling is so thirsty you can just keep feeding it water almost as long as you care to? Tonight I learned that this soap is the opposite. It prefers a just damp brush and a few drops of water on top of the puck and I was rewarded with a cushiony, creamy lather with all the skin goodness and ultra-slickness of a cold saponified. It does break down much faster than hot soaps but I don't mind reapplying a couple times a pass. Topped off with Stirling's Tea Tree splash and my face couldn't be happier.",

A nice, slightly sweet slightly spicy sandalwood. I used the old sample sided splash that I have in a plastic spray container; the scent is different from the newer release and I prefer this one. I'm not sure if the scent was changed for the newer rerelease or if with time and being in plastic the scent notes changed (maybe a bit of both; the sample was already probably a year old when I got it).\n\nThe Piccolo gives a great shave as usual.\n\nShared from [My Shave Den for iOS](https://apps.apple.com/app/1581646387)",

This man, this saint, through his own volition (I think I just sent him 2-3 smushes) responded not *in kind*, but far *too kind*! Thanks to him, today will begin a few new eras for me:\n\nI have only ever used an Edwin Jagger DE89 before switching to my Merkur Futur and never looking back. But, my man sent along a beautiful GEM MMOC with GEM blades from Accutec near my old house in Verona, VA. It's a gorgeous piece and I have never seen its equal. I can't wait to get to grips with it. Speaking of which, the grip is so lovely in the hand.\n\nI'm 39, just this year, I started to dip my toe into \"fragrance\" thanks to you folks. By that, I mean, I use Tabac and Royall BayRhum57. My man sent me four REAL fragrances! Each vial worth around $10!!! This Mind Games Double Attack smells gorgeous. The dry down is to chocolate, but it is hardly a gourmand. Now I see the difference between aftershave and cologne. Now I know that spices don't last but that a fragrance is built on base notes. My big brother is going to be formally installed as a deacon at his church after completing his M.Div on the 20^(th). Now, I can go back to my family not only wearing a suit, but a proper cologne that I like.\n\nAdditionally, he included a Zoologist perfume. My roommate has, like me, never considered cologne. But, as we sat oooing and ahhing over the fragrances, she sprayed the Harvest Mouse on her and fell in love. She had the same feeling I did, u/Admirable-Nobody-946 has opened up a new world to her and we found other samples of Zoologist that we wanted to try. He also included a fragrance made by bostonphototourist and sold by mammothben. Again, a G move by the former. Will, you're a real perfumer! This smells fantastic! He sent another beautiful fragrance was sent but I have not yet smelled it: Bad Boy by Carolina Herrera.\n\nAll I asked for was a smush of Chiseled Face Santa Monica Bay Rum. My man put in a whole 10g Maggards sample, along with my very first rocketk455 soap: wood shop! This is fabulous. I see where rocketk455 is coming from. It really does take me (and did take my roommate) to a wood shop for real! I have been hesitant to purchase from Shannon's Soaps since I found out their political views (more the way they express those), but he included Indigo Oud and it is very special. It reminds me of my father. I miss my father (he is still with us, of course). And, this opened up the world of Oud to me, which I previously thought wasn't for me. He also included The Magician by Zingari Man and it is something really fascinating. Finally, he included this Spicy Passage soap from Bundubeard. It smells terrific.\n\nThank you, u/Admirable-Nobody-946 for your immense generosity and for opening up so many new worlds for me. When I first thanked him, he said people on this sub had been so kind to him. He said (not in so many words), the motto I have been living by and spent the last sixteen years saying to my students: \"Pay it back by paying it forward.\" Thank you again brother. I will pay it back by paying it forward. But, if you ever want or need, I will pay you back, and I have your back. You will always have a friend in this world as long as I am alive.",

It was an interesting experience. I learned that my lather sucks, and I kept adding water but for some reason it was still so sticky. Because of that, the shave was a little rough, so I'll need to keep working on that. I'm also working on getting the angle down, which I'm sure also contributed to the roughness.\n\nI'll be stropping it before my next shave, so any tips on how to test if I've stropped it well/enough?\n\nI was sweating bullets the entire time! (Though I'd like to contribute that to the humidity in my bathroom, I know I cant). But I only nicked myself a few times (like on my ear), but nothing bad at all, and everything was cleared up with the alum. I'll certainly need more practice to get more comfortable with it, but I consider today a success.\n\nHappy Friday, everyone! Have a great weekend!",

I have made the drive to Metropolis, IL more than once to see the events they host each year.\n\nOf course, certain segments of the US population are complaining that someone from another planet is described as being \"an immigrant\", especially in light of the recent harsh treatment immigrants are receiving from the current administration. But facts are funny things. Just because one might not want to acknowledge an inconvenient truth, doesn't mean it isn't one.\n\nKryptonite was my AA soap from last year. I ended up burning through at least half this tub and I don't believe I have used it since.

Blade fouled on the original scales so I decided to rescale it. Turns out the tang itself is warped. I'd expect nothing less from what I'm assuming was a tobacco company's licensed name stamped by another (likely low quality) razor maker. Shave was meh today. Not awful, not great. Middle of the road.\n\nEasy to forget how far soap bases have come in just a few short years. I always remember white label fondly as a great performing base. Then I pick it up and use it and realize it suffers by comparison to modern bases. still got the job done, and bonus I finally killed this tub of Lavanille after 7? 8? Years of occasional use.\n\nLove the smell of Lavanille. It's just beautiful and simplistic. I love Lavender Interrupted as well but for different reasons. While I think LI may be one of Will's best scents to date, Lavanille hits some kinda nostalgia for me. Hope everyone's having a great Friday!\n\n$Discord",

It's the same width as their 1 oz samples (I think the samples are just sliced refill pucks). Anyway, you could smash the puck down to better fill their 5oz jars but I leave mine as-is. I cut wedges out for each shave to keep it nice and tidy. Haverford has this deep, dark brown color. Slicing it like I do, I see it has a nice off-white core. With the scent, it really put me in mind of [Hostess Ding Dong](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ding_Dong) cakes from my childhood.\n\nHave a great Friday!",

I feel like I'm getting the hang of this. I really upped my Lather game today, and I added a ton more water than I normally do. I feel like I made this discovery before, but for some reason I have to learn it all over again. Lather was much better today, nice and soupy and changed my shave a lot. Not sticky anymore! It's so interesting, because I feel like Safety razors mask the sticky dry Lather, but SRs make it immediately obvious haha.\n\nStropped for the first time too, and no nicks on the strop!!\n\nI only nicked myself a few times minorly (that square tip sure can bite), but they stopped bleeding even before I put my alum block on. I'm content with the shave today, I did WTG+XTG, and I got a much closer shave than I get with the safety's with XTG. Still dialing in my technique and angle and everything, but lots of progress since yesterday.\n\nHave a great weekend everyone!!",

Thanks to u/Engineered_Shave for the trade.\n\nI am still trying to figure out what I want to use soap wise for this year's Austere August. This is an option, the Stirling Mutton option is available to me and of course, I am a member of the Mammoth Mafia, so that's a possibility too. I am not a fan of straight razors, and Midnight Stag is vile to me.\n\nBut I thought I might suggest a couple of other options:\n\n1. Declaration Grooming: Independence Day. Must eat jelly beans after each shave.\n\n2. Barrister and Mann: Use any base, but Omnibus.\n\n3. Summer Break Soaps: Shave nine days in a row. Skip 3 days, repeat the cycle.\n\n4. \"Gone but not forgotten\": Shave with a soaper no longer in the business; APR, Storybook Soapworks, Southern Witchcrafts, etc.\n\n5. \"Foreign Affairs\": Shave with soap from a foreign country. APR, Proraso, Cella, Tabac, etc.\n\nOn to the shave.... Mike's is really easy to lather. The post shave feel is very good, and I can see why many people like it a lot. The only downside is that he doesn't offer any matching aftershaves. But, given his choices of soap scents that's less than an issue than one might think.\n\n2 passes. Good shave.",

The extra long tang is kind of fun. I'm not used to such hollow blades so I ever so slightly nicked myself behind my jaw; I'm used to the blade flexing a bit rather than breaking the skin; this razor requires a bit of modification to my technique. Only downside is the pivot is a bit loose.\n\nShared from [My Shave Den for iOS](https://apps.apple.com/app/1581646387)",

When I started, I made the time to do two or three passes. Then just two. Now one. And even more recently, only one, but using Arko. I love the quality of a DE shave as much as the next shaver, but I can now see why some people may not want to commit to this. I've been wetshaving nearly ten years, and the grind is real, but man-oh-man is it nice to get back to a luxury shave like today.\n\nBe well!",

Todays shave was a test of my first edge from my new Olympus Stone. The stone provided an excellent quality edge overall. It felt to me very much like an edge from a dense Black Arkansas stone, though the makeup and feel of these two stones is very different. I look forward to much more experience with this Olympus Stone.\n\n[video](https://youtu.be/EOOTOe0ifmY)\n\n$Discord",

She sent me four smushes! Noble Otter's Italian Summer, Maggard's London Barbershop and Limes and Bergamot, and Eleven's Limes and Basil. I also want to thank u/partyman97_3 for sending me a smush of Henri Et Victoria's Bay Rum and Catie's Bubbles's Crangere. You folks in this sub are amazing. [Here is my soap collection. ](https://imgur.com/a/shave-soap-collection-uT2MZTr)If anybody would like a smush of anything, please don't hesitate to let me know. I want to pay it back by paying it forward.\n\nI have been searching for a summer lemon scented soap, aftershave, and fragrance. Noble Otter's Italian Summer is exceptional, but I wonder if maybe it is a different category (an Italian scent built around Lemon and other Citrus). I think I want a straight lemon, or lemon and some bubbles (kind of how I have Mike's Lime or Margaritas in the Arctic without menthol).\n\nI keep wondering about Shannon's Soaps's Lemon Prosecco. I know that their political views keep me from wanting to support them. Perhaps I bite the bullet? But, that leads me to another issue. I have been seeing a lot of folks supporting Phoenix Artisan Accoutrements lately (PAA) and saying that Douglas or whatever his name is is no longer shady. But, I don't know if he ever apologized. I don't know what the statute of limitations is for forgiveness. I love Bay Rum and folks def. love his Bay Rums. But, I saw three years ago a lot of folks on this sub that I respect point out how much he sucks and then, I just don't know. **Please** weigh in if you have thoughts.\n\nI also wonder about Eleven's Sicilian Lemon. I know that Zingari Man does Il Signore. I do not know what category to put these in. The search continues, but I will definitely keep using this Italian Summer. It is brilliant!",

This set, and Glastonbury are the Mutton Tallow entries. This scent is probably a \"love it or hate it, there's no in between\" option. Scent notes are Lemon, Citronella, and Eucalyptus.\n\nThe wife and I went out yesterday morning and got a new MMR (Measles, Mumps, and Rubella) jab. We both got our original shots during the Kennedy administration and that was when you only got a single dose. We both like to travel, and who knows what we might encounter thanks to folks doing their \"research\" on Facebook.\n\nThe razor is the Mamba-70. It's a little more aggressive than the OG Mamba, which is .53. Both are decent \"every day\" razors for those of you who enjoy or are required to shave every day. (You know who you are), and/or you prefer a milder razor.\n\nFinally, every time I use this setup, I think of a song by one of my guitar heroes. Adrian Belew and \"Big Electric Cat\". If you don't know who he is, he's played with Frank Zappa, David Bowie, The Talking Heads, and was a member of King Crimson. He's originally from the Cincinnati area and lives in a suburb of Nashville now when he's not on tour.\n\n\n[Big Electric Cat](https://youtu.be/O_kk8mGqBj8?si=zRLgJKsEEcs4fsPT)",

I thought this sample was the tallow version of Merchant of Tobacco, but based on the thinness and less performance at the end of the shave, I'm guessing it was the vegan. It's a really nice scent though and was stronger than my Stirling favorites.\n\nI'm having a good time with Lo Storto. He's teaching me to be a better shaver. Not a bit of irritation, but if my mind wanders, I get a little bit of painless blood. The Feather blades seem to be at home with Lo Storto.\n\nHave a great Sunday!",

I had the unfortunate timing of pulling the trigger on this soap while putting together my yearly soap restock only to learn 2 days later that the sub exclusive Sheep version was ready to roll. So of course I had to place another friggin' order for the Sheep-y Moose. Rod nailed the scent of the Moos in the soap. It's a dead ringer. The splash is pretty damn close, but there's a scent note that can't quite be replicated in the Stirling formula. I'll have to use the original splash tomorrow for a comparison. Regardless, if you're waiting for the Sheep-y set and you like Irisch Moos, you're not going to be complaining.\n\nI am complaining about the fact that my relaxing vacation is over and I need to go back to work. Re-entry is going to be a pain in the ass so let's try to make it slightly less painful with a coffee infusion. Try to enjoy your day and remember to be kind to one another.\n\n$Discord",

The injector performed well once I dialed it up to 6. It just didn't seem to be doing well at lower settings (I started at 4).\n\nI'm not sure about the scent of Uitwaaien. It's described on the HoM website as \"a woody iris perfume with a salty aspect, inspired by a rocky beach I used to go with my friends as a kid.\" I was expecting something fresh and beachy, but that's not what I'm getting. The soap didn't smell like much (although I did get the salty aspect) and the splash smelled vaguely medicinal, which seems a little weird. Maybe my nose is miscalibrated, but it just wasn't appealing. I was hoping to use this soap/splash as my induction into the Mammoth Mafia, but I think I'm going to have to try something else, as I don't know if I can see myself using this for a month.\n\n🪒 Many Happy Shaves! 🪒",

The original is a little darker or more fougere-ier, if I can use that word, than Stirling's version on first application. However, I found that that the drydown of the Stirling version gets pretty close to the original version as some time goes on. Again, I have to hand it to Rod as he nailed this scent.

GUYS. I feel like I absolutely nailed my straight razor shave today! 3 passes, WTG, XTG, and ATG (as much as I could against, at least), and a pretty darn smooth shave. I got nice and close shave, not a BBS, but close enough to not see the stubble, which hardly ever happens for me (yay dark thick hair and white pasty skin). Had to do some crazy angle gymnastics on my neck, but I got there. And the alum only stung a little bit!\n\nI'll be honest, the last few days I was really considering not doing Headless Horsemen for AA. I felt like there's so much maintenance with a SR shave, and I felt like it was impossible to get a super close shave on my neck, just because of all the nooks and crannies and angles. But today, I feel like my lather game was on-point, my prep helped a ton, and I'm finding my sweet spot for shaving technique. So, I think I'm gonna go for it!\n\nNow for my shame. Just a PSA for everyone, don't be a moron like me and try to flick off your straight razor in the sink (for the lather, water, or anything). Did it out of habit, and took a nice ding in the edge :/\n\nAlso, not sure I wanna keep doing the Frankenstein leftovers. Now that I've learned I wasn't near hydrating my lather enough, my leftovers have been super watery and soupy, even after being out for a day. Before, it would all dry completely. So now I feel like I'm keeping a science experiment in my closet🙃\n\nHope you all are doing well! Have a terrific Tuesday!",

It's delightful. I know I initially wrote that I used Noble Otter's Barrbarr today, but just as I got in the shower I remembered that u/socialkittielynx had kindly sent me a smush of Maggard's London Barbershop. Thank you buddy! Nice little combo here!\n\nI've said it before, and I will say it again: Fine Accoutrements makes great smelling aftershaves, but there is no way on Earth I will pay those prices anymore. Currently looking for a new interpretation of Barber Blue aftershave. Barber Blue is a dupe of Floid Blue. I'm thinking Epsilon Mediterranean Blue. But, I wanted to ask u/bostonphototourist: is the Cool Blue that Stirling now sells a dupe of Floid Blue or similar in any way?\n\nHave an awesome day, everyone!",

We have well water at our house, and it's currently being treated with bleach. I've been showering at the local Rec Center yesterday and today, and figured it'd be a good idea to shave there as well.\n\nI got my travel brush, a travel razor/blade, and Moose out of my backpack, slung a towel over my shoulder, and headed to the sinks. It's the type of sink setup that you might see at an airport. A single \"trough\", but a modern style with automatic spouts, automatic soap dispensers, and automatic hand dryers at each station. I hate this setup even for washing hands, but I was on a mission. There was just enough shelf space to hold things.\n\nLathering was effortless, and the fragrance of Moose was a delight. A half naked man walked behind me on the way to the shower, but paid me no mind. Pass number two started to get interesting. People started showing up to use the toilets and urinals (located behind me) and washing their hands at adjacent sink stations. While I appreciate good hygene, it was taking away from the relaxing vibe that I've come to expect while shaving.\n\nI caught a glimpse in the mirror of what would ultimately bring my shave to a rather abrupt end. A large, bald, shirtless, 60ish year old man entered one of the stalls directly behind me. I don't know what he had for lunch, but the sounds eminating from his stall make me think he should probably avoid it in the future. I pressed on, only having half of the second pass, and a 3rd pass to go.\n\nWith the 4 or 5 bathroom patrons slowly dissipating, I felt like a 3rd pass was easily in the cards. Then it hit me -- the fresh, spicy, musky scent of I, Rich Moose started to blend with other smells that can hardly be described as \"pleasant\". I quickly finished my second pass, rinsed *most* of the soap out of my brush, and retreated to the adjacent room as quickly as possible.\n\nEven with only two passes, I got a very decent shave! I would definitely shave at the Rec Center again, but maybe I'll wait for late evening when it's not as busy and people have mostly finished their daily movements.",

I grabbed this WW brush at the Maggard meet and it might be one of my favorites in the collection. The quality of Peter's work is unmatched and the guy is an S-tier brush artisan. I had to buy this one when I saw it on the table and picked up the badger knot the same day. The only razor I've really used all month is this Sabre I bought right before LG and was the last one on the site. Between the 2 single edge razors Blackland makes, they done fucked up choosing to keep the Vector over this. Shane told me GEM razors don't sell which I know is true and there are more AC blade options when it comes to user choice but between this and the Vector the shave experience with this is so much better. I've been playing with the interchangeable safety bars and have really been liking levels 2 and 3. Level 1 is too mild for my preference but 2 and 3 are efficient enough for a couple days growth but still mild enough to use daily. I haven't used level 4 yet because there hasn't been a need. But it's nice having all four to choose from.\n\n$Discord",

I consistently get great shaves from Vida's soaps, both the older base (did it have a name?) and darkwing, and today was no different.\n\nI'm trying to decide which Friodur to use for this year's Austere August and I'm waffling between today's weird masonic deco Frio 50 with [the murky history](https://sub.wetshaving.social/post/1105618), the venerable Frio 14, the chonkier Frio 17, the Frio \"the cleaver\" 72-V, and a normal 72 or 59. My dilemmata:\n\n1. I think my favourite option is the Frio 50, a great shaver, but it's what I used last year.\n2. The 14 is my favourite razor of all times, but I guess I want to use it sparingly and deliberately.\n3. The 17 is a great shaver but feels a bit normal for AA\n4. I've never used a wedge consistently for a month, so the 72-V would be interesting, but I wonder whether I'd miss the crunch of a hollow.\n5. All of the above are hard to replace if they get lost, and I'll be travelling during the lead-up to and the beginning of AA, so plenty of opportunity for lost baggage.\n6. The 72 or 59 are fine shavers, but there's to oomph there. The upside is that I wouldn't mind terribly if they got lost during a flight.\n\nToday's shave was fantastic, so I think I'm leaning towards a repeat of the masonic 50.",

And this release is definitely making my AA soap choice more challenging.\n\nThe choice to make coffee is not a challenging one. It is not even a choice.

It's a waste of electricity. People are already wearing lighter layers because it's hot outside; then they need to layer up with sweaters and blankets once they get to their desks. It's gotten too hot outside to wear my winter boots into work, so my feet are left cold even with thick socks. Maybe it's comfortable for the big shots who wear a suit and tie and sit in their own climate controlled offices, leave their air conditioned homes through their air conditioned garage, air conditioned car, to their private spot near the elevator in the underground parking; but they don't pay the rest of us well enough for that.\n\nWell that's the end of my Wednesday mini rant.\n\nShared from [My Shave Den for iOS](https://apps.apple.com/app/1581646387)",

Today just might be a two shower day. I have an appointment over the lunch hour and then I'm going to cut the grass, unless it rains. We have had a hot, wet Spring and Summer so far and the grass is getting pretty tall. We have 3 small dogs (Poodle, Maltese, Shih Tsu ), and none of them like it when the grass is tall or wet. The Shih Tsu (the only male), is a bit of a drama queen, and will pee on the sidewalk if the grass is too wet.\n\nThis is another set that I am considering for AA. Cool and Fresh is great for Summer weather: Spearmint, Peppermint, Eucalyptus, Camphor, and Menthol.\n\nThe Wife has vetoed Glastonbury, was ambivalent about Electric Sheep, and liked Mike's Bay Rum the best so far. I probably have more Bay Rum and Bay Rum adjacent sets in my den than anything else, so I have plenty of splash options to pair with Mike's.\n\nGreat brush that has a \"repurposed\" Maggard Badger knot. The razor and blade combo didn't work well as I did three passes and still not the BBS shave. New blade tomorrow.\n\nShared from [My Shave Den for iOS](https://apps.apple.com/app/1581646387)",

I only have the GEM blade that's currently loaded in it, and it's completely dead; felt way too much stubble for having just ran a razor over my face. Such a shame, as it was fun to use!

One, I love the new Stirling I, Rich Moose scent. It is a classically masculine scent with an undeniable green undercurrent. It reminds me of a scent that my grandfather used for his aftershave, but with a fresh green flavor mixed in that (in my mind) modernizes it.\n\nThis is also the first time I've tried a mutton base of any kind (don't know if Stirling is the only brand with it). It performed like any of my other stirling soaps have, which is flawless!\n\nSuper happy with my shave this morning, and I hope all of you can say the same!",

Some people think the mutton base smells a little weird, but I like it. I will certainly need more practice with the base and forget how much water Stirling can take. A few members of the sub mentioned that using Stirling splash with a damp face and hands is the proper way to apply. I did that today to experiment. Also experienced a lot of burning that I couldn't tell if it was from the high alcohol content or frag burn. Thank you u/j33pguy13 for putting this together",

I think I might be erring on the side of too much water in my lather now, the slickness has been somewhat lacking the last few days.\n\nBeen happy with my shaves! It's had been a hot minute since I've pulled out my Rockwell 6S, but I've been getting a lot better shaves than I remember getting from it.\n\nI've also been experimenting with wearing fragrances, and I think I like it. I would really like the soaps that the scent would linger all day (HoM I think I remember being really good for this), so I've need branching out to dedicatee colognes to smell throughout the day, since a lot of my soaps scents don't last much beyond the shave. I had this sample bottle from a \"welcome\" kit I got years ago from Manscaped (actually the same kit I got my first safety razor from), so I pulled it out. Turns out, to my nose, it smells A LOT like HoM Beloved (one of the first soap samples I got, and I really like the scent). So, lots of happy coincidences, and I've liked smelling the frag all day.\n\nAnd, just got a bottle of Stirling Hipster EdT (yeeeeet Moose haul), so I'm stoked to work that into my routine.\n\nHave a great day, all!

Today's shave was a shave test of two new edges. Both razors have the same Jnat edge; a progression of nagura on a Nakayama Maruka Shohonyama. Could I tell the difference in steel? No. The edge on both razors was great for me, and the only difference was the grind. The 72-V is half hollow, and the Moarteen is full hollow. The shave quality was equivalent.",

I have to make some decisions for AA, you know. I got a perfect lather using my least favorite boar brush, funny enough. The 1800 is just so soft, but maybe that's what you need when you are dealing with a really firm puck like Mike's. Loading the 1800 like it owes you money doesn't feel or look the same as if you're doing it with MOAR BOAR. The 1800 ain't a soap killer. But the best lather I've gotten with this soap and then topped off with some Iced Pineapple. I like it, but I don't think I would need a full bottle of this.\n\nI do need to get 2 full cups of coffee into my system before I go and teach aerial yoga this morning.

It might be sacrilegious to not use the r/wetshaving exclusive Moose first, but I've been excited about Cool Blue since the sale was announced. The wait was worth it. The scent is vaguely reminiscent of a barbershop minus the sweet powdery elements.\n\nNormally, three pass shaves are a bit of a luxury for me. Either time doesn't allow for it, or my neck would get a bit irritated after a couple of days. But I've been able to enjoy and get great results from three passes all week. Something about face lathering along with paying close attention to pressure and angle is making a difference. This morning was another great feeling, and great smelling shave.\n\nFace WTG ATG Cleanup.\nNeck WTG XTG XTG.\n\n$discord",

Way too much stinging!\n\nSorry /u/jeffm54321, but Osma is just too harsh!\n\n#### ䷀ Razor and Blade Notes\n*^(Koraat - MOARTeen ::: ‹ uses›)*\n\nThis was a special order straight for some of us in the wetshaving subreddit. More can be found on it online, but basically it was taking the Korat \"piggy bank\" razor and making some tweaks to make it have the blade of a 14 style razor. This seems to be a fairly legendary type, with many fans.\n\nI am no example of good straight technique, so take my video as just a diary entry, and any wisdom that might be in it is stuff that I've learned from those before me.\n\nI did not immediately identify with this razor. Something more like a wedge seems to be a little easier for my straight-noob hands to manage. However, I didn't have any negative issues with it. I generally proceed conservatively with my SR attempts.\n\nAfter the first pass, I did feel a little tenderness, but no irritation. The second pass went well and the razor moved smoothly.\n\nBut I did stop after the second, just to play it safe. I think I ended up with a pretty good shave.\n\nI did do a separate unboxing video to talk about the razor more.\n\nThis is my first modern straight and I jumped on the opportunity because it was a great deal for such quality.\n\nI think about 50 of us had to sign up to make the deal work.\n\nRazor and Blade Performance/Comfort Rating: 3 out of 5 (Good)\n\n#### ䷀ Soap Notes\n*^(Stirling Mutton Tallow - Glastonbury)*\n\nThem: \"Patchouli, Lavender, Oakmoss, Lichen, Frankincense, and Vetiver\"\n\nScent: I do get the patchouli at first, and maybe something else, like the Lav and maybe Frankincense or so. But at the end of the shave, the Patchouli layer had gone, leaving me with a different scent than I started with. Very cool, and I liked both.\n\nThis is a nice merging of scents, where one doesn't boss the others around. It's also not overly patchouli, so someone who likes the other elements has a good chance of liking this scent, even if patchouli is not their thing. A very well-designed accord, IMO.\n\nThis may not be a scent pattern that I am instantly drawn to, but I think it's feasible that I could all the sudden crave this one at some point down the road.\n\nScent Strength: 5/10, nicely present during shaving.\n\nLather... Started with a lightly wet brush and a fairly dry early lather came up quickly. Then I dumped in 20 ml of water and kept mixing/integrating it.\n\nGooey lather money shot: https://youtu.be/a3W3732lhew?si=V22YtfKdDqLMwoI-&t=790\n\nGood lather in general, but maybe could have used a little more water since I worked with a straight.\n\nHydration: Dry End of Perfect *(for me)*\n+ 25 ml (5.1 tsp) added to build the lather\n+ = 5 passes of lather\n\nBowl: [Roger Quintero 3D Printed Bowl](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3392930)\nI use the XL version of this bowl.\n\n#### ䷀ Brush Notes\n*^(Zenith - r/wetshaving MOAR BOAR B35/508A XL ‹60 uses›)*\n\nGreat as usual.\n\n----\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Light irritation showed up at end\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Close Shave\n*Neck*: Many hairs show whisker tips with a little length to them\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm) *and also in the sub's sidebar.*\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

It didn't need much water but still stayed nicely hydrated throughout the shave. Normally I have to keep adding water when using a straight since I'm slow with my passes, but the sheep base held its own. The scent is still something I'm warming up to, but the aftershave didn't burn nearly as bad as it did yesterday. I think it's safe to keep it in the rotation.\n\nI meant to share this a couple days ago but completely forgot. A patient asked me if it was okay to go back to straight razor shaving. He had stopped because of being on blood thinners. Unfortunately, after a recent procedure, he had to go back on them, so I had to reluctantly say no. He said he's been using an electric razor and hates every minute of it. I really wanted to talk more since he was clearly a fellow wetshaver, but it was a busy day.\n\n$discord",

Life of Pets in the Media Room, popcorn and our small dogs in their laps begging for belly rubs and begging for bites of their popcorn. The older girl is a clone of her mother, and the younger one looks a lot like her dad did at that age. It was a very good time.\n\nWanted to use something that I haven't used in a while, and this is the one that really jumped out at me. This is the Excelsior Base, but it is still available in the Omnibus base. Chypre was made famous by the perfume of the same name in released by Coty in 1917. Notes: Oakmoss, Labdanum, Frankincense, Bergamot, Rose, Lime, Patchouli, Peach, Musk, Cedar. It's a wonderful Spring and Summer option.\n\n3 passes for a relaxed shave. I picked up a bar of Stirling Clubman and I, Rich Moose and both smell great. I would have grabbed a set of the Stirling Cool Blue for traveling but then I remembered that I have a tub of B&M Cool in the Soft Hearts base already and had to pass. It's already in my dopp bag and I haven't traveled much in the last two years.\n\nThe last full week of July is nigh, so finalize your AA selections soon.\n\nShared from [My Shave Den for iOS](https://apps.apple.com/app/1581646387)",

Because of that I decided to pair it with the matching splash. La Poire Française EdP also pairs well so I went for it. A lovely shave.\n\nMy next thought is whether or not I want to go for the \"raw hogging\" achievement and pick up a new boar brush; and with that, the question arises of which brush do I want. It'll also need to arrive in time for August 1st, which rules out ordering anything non-domestic (so no Zeniths). I love my Semogue 830; the Omega brushes I've tried have been meh to okay, so I probably won't get another. So debating another Semogue (maybe the 2000 or 1250), a Vulfix (never had one of those), or there's a Vie-long boar that is a long lofted skinny knot...

As I've never shaved with the 34c, I decided to use both. I used the GOAT for one side of my face, swapped the blade into the 34c and did my other half. On my second pass, I did the first side with the 34c, swapped the blade again and finished up with the GOAT. So each side of my face shaved with both razors.\n\nI have to say, I preferred the 34c over the GOAT. To me is seemed to be the smoother shave. We'll see how the GOAT is on shave #2, though. I think it just has a bit more blade feel than I generally like. Not a bad razor (as I did end up with a good shave), but not my favorite.\n\n$Discord",

I usually don't shave on Sundays, but since I skipped Saturday, I didn't want to stay prickly for another day.\n\nAlso unusual because I usually don't like shaving with Cheshire. I adore the scent -- it really does smell just like Earl Gray tea and I love Earl Grey, but I think my brain rejects the idea of putting something on my face that it thinks should go in my mouth.\n\nI commented on another thread that I should give it another try today. So I did. And it was great! I don't know what happened. Maybe I just decided to ignore my brain (it can overthink things which gets me into trouble sometimes). Anyway, it along with the new Vetyver after shave were fantastic.\n\n🪒 Many Happy Shaves! 🪒",

I brought some software to work to give it to my working student, so he can try black watch and Rumble. He gave me 3 SV soaps.\nTill the end of the month, I can get 3 shaves with each soap.\nHe brought me Cosmo, Cubeve and Argania. Argania is my favorite of them. I am looking forward to try them and see how they feel.",

I do like the scent on white though so I'll use it occasionally to mix things up.\n\n\nThe blue is incredible. Wish they'd make it in a puck version (I think there are some available in Italy if I'm not mistaken?). I can't stress how nice the face feels after using it lol, so soft and smooth..",

I tried using the most aggressive blade exposure setting, and boy oh boy was that a mistake. I haven't cut myself that many times since I froze my MMOC in the 2024 Lather Games. I brought it down a couple of settings before I even finished my first pass, not wanting to risk even nicks. I think that excessive of a blade exposure probably defeats the purpose of using an AC razor in the first place-or at the very least it didn't work for me. This razor is fun, but as the honeymoon period has passed, I'm no longer certain it's worth saving up for. We'll see if I end up changing my mind when I start itching to buy something new.\n\nReally pleasant scents today. I might have to find a couple of plastic tubs to move the Woolly Wash soaps into, as loading in the tins makes a big mess, and I really don't enjoy scooping and bowl lathering except for samples/when I have to.\n\nAnyway, that's enough rambling for a Monday morning. Today's probably going to be a two or three coffee day. Best of luck to everyone, remember to be kind to yourselves and each other.",

No nicks/irritation. Plate 2 with a Feather blade was no match for my 4 day growth. I wanted to see how the razor/blade combo on that setting did against that amount of growth, and needless to say, it worked really well. I'm happy with the results I got, and I'm also pleased with the usual fantastic performance from the rest of the products, including the soap of course. Overall, great shave to start off this week really well.",

I had the idea to see how light a touch I could keep; shaving my easy spots at my typical low angle, but raising the angle somewhat for the difficult spots. Worked like a champ! Why did I do this? Well, my thought was that in the easy areas, the stubble grows (mostly) straight out of the skin leaning slightly in the WTG direction, but in the difficult areas, my thought was that the stubble grows more at an angle from the skin, and not always in the same direction. For these trouble areas, the higher angle provides the same cutting relationship (blade to stubble) as the low angle does for the easy areas. So, yeah, I went full shaving nerd today.\n\nGreat edge, btw. I'm on good terms with the sharpener.",

The thermostat for the air conditioning at my work is broken so it doesn't turn off like it should; so it's around 15C in the office (60F, based on the one non-fake liquid thermometer; the others are stickers) with even colder Arctic air falling down on you. You walk around and run into walls of icy air because the HVAC system isn't blowing the air around as it should either. I'm working from home today because a) it is too cold to think, and b) it's making me feel like I'm getting sick, since my body is spending far too much energy simply trying to stay warm enough.\n\nSo yeah, bananas.\n\nPicked a straight with a curved yellow handle since that seemed fitting. Though I should have stropped it prior to use since I hadn't used it in a while. But even still, despite its not feeling super smooth during the shave, it was a DFS 2 pass.\n\nShared from [My Shave Den for iOS](https://apps.apple.com/app/1581646387)",

I've seen countless pictures of the storied soup, far too many to ever dare spend money on one of his products myself and take a gamble on the curing being done properly. I happened upon this set as it was included with two B&M EDTs I'd been hunting for awhile now, Lavanille and Hallows, so I was able to try this with zero risk to my wallet. This tub also was a mixed bag of curing. Half of the soap was soft to the touch like a soft croap, and the other had cured hard to the touch. After repositioning the soap so it filled the container (it had separated from the walls at some point), I was ready to lather up.\n\nThe soap did perform admirably. The Kairos SE base is very slick once properly hydrated, but it's definitely very very thirsty. The scent I wasn't sure about at first but it did quickly grow on me. The green tea mixed with honey and lemon is a nice fresh combination without being overpowering. The Art Razor Gulliver mowed through 3 days of stubble with ease. It's not hard to see why this razor began my love affair with Yurii's work. The large hollow blade glides through hair while making a satisfying ASMR crackle as the hairs pop off.\n\nWould I buy another GD soap? Considering how well it performed, I'd be willing to give it another try. Has he improved at all in his soap curing process over the past few years? I've been out of the loop on that. Any scents I simply must try? Let me know!\n\n$discord",

I love it and missed it.\n\nThis is my first go with Stirling Clubman. I am a huge fan of Pinuad Clubman, so I had to grab this set before leaving. The scent is good, but to me and my nose, it misses the Clubman mark slightly. A lot of the usual suspects are there: the lemon, orange, bergamot, lavender and geranium, and jasmine. Where it misses the mark is the musk. There's not a lot, and I feel like strong musk is a hallmark of Clubman. It should be leading the pack on this scent and giving it that trademark powdery smell in combination with the florals, with the citrus in the background highlighting the rest. So, all in all, it's a good scent, sweeter than you'd expect, but good. Not my favorite Clubman dupe, but I'll certainly be keeping it.\n\nClose and comfortable shave, no nicks or irritation.\n\n$discord",

Shave went perfectly with the Tech & Feather and the fougère & Clubman all working together nicely.\n\n(One of the advantages of working from home and having a boss who's 6000 miles away is that I can really work from anywhere and nobody knows the difference).\n\n🪒 Many Happy Shaves! 🪒",

This was a very kind gesture.\n\nI've heard very good things about this soap base and about the scent that Peter Charkalis created but, honestly, I was concerned that the MdC-inspired glass jar and the large frosted glass aftershave bottle might be more marketing than special bespoke packaging.\n\nFor me, the experience was terrific. The lather is rich and creamy, and it is very slick. I think the scent is great. Right up my alley. You can research the notes but, to me, it does come across as described; a barbershop scent with oud. I think it is well blended and feels sophisticated. I'd say, the scent strength is medium in both the soap and splash. I though Royal Oud was a perfect fit to finish this off.",

I don't have much experience to speak of with German made blades, but I almost loved this blade out of the gate. It was pretty smooth and sharp and I thought I got a terrific shave, until I detected a ferrous scent...you know the one. I did not see any blood, until I went to rinse. It zapped a little bump on my neck and that was surprising for the A-plate. I'll give it a few more shaves and see how it does. For now, it's good to have an option, should I ever find myself somewhere that I need to get razor blades and there is a CVS nearby.\n\nHave a great night and be kind to one another.\n\n$Discord",

And, u/admirable-nobody-946 is the Wet Shaving Prometheus. Where I was just sitting content with my Merkur Futur, he gifted me the ancient wisdom of the past. My very first vintage razor. I cannot even begin to describe the shave I had with it. It was beautiful. Just an absolute joy and pleasure. So sharp, so efficient, and yet so smooth. I will be using it in AA, for sure.\n\nI just got Dr. Jon's Burning Bay on the zaar. Pimenta Racemosa, Smoke, Rum and it is bloody powerful. But, it went perfectly with this shave. To stay on the theme of smoke-and fire, because the Wetshaving Prometheus u/admirable-nobody-946 gifted me some fucking fire-I am enjoying a beautiful cup of Thyolo Moto from Malawi's Satemwa Estate. It is perhaps the first Lapsang Souchong (smoked) style tea from Africa. They use Guava Wood and it is subtle and delicious. I love seeing African estates producing orthodox (whole leaf) teas and not just producing CTC (crush-tear-curl, the stuff that goes into tea bags) for Lipton or Yorkshire Gold. They can make more money that way and it opens up new terroir and techniques for us to try.\n\nJust how I support the artisans in the wetshaving world, I try to do so in the tea world. Speaking of which, make space in your dens for some fragrance creations from u/pridetwo. Sign up if you haven't already to get newsletters from his new business (once he gets it up and going). It's the GLHF Workshop. I forgot what those letters stand for so let's just call it the Galactically Luxurious Hot Fragrance Workshop until he reminds us what the real name is. He's about to start creating some good stuff and I'm excited to support him. Speaking of tea, he's got a London Fog fragrance that should be awesome.\n\nIn addition to Burning Bay, I also got [Tallow + Steel Grog](https://imgur.com/a/unobtainium-gWxyIqj) which I look forward tomorrow. That shit...also bloody powerful. Anybody want a smush of either, please let me know. Except for u/throwa-waaaay, (I already put your two smushes in the mail, boss). If the Mystic Water I sent you a few days ago was subtle, these two are the opposite end of the spectrum. I hear that [Ryan even had to dial back the pimenta racemosa oil in Grog II ](https://tallowandsteel.com/pages/archive)because this one is so strong.\n\nI became a historian because as a child my mother would take me to antique and thrift shops. I would get goosebumps when I held anything older than myself. I would often buy a book or some other item and wonder about its life story. I'd tell my mother that there was a world out there of treasures and lost knowledge to discover. I have not felt that feeling in too long. It's been replaced by my co-editors need me to finish these effing sections of our book proposal or by this piece goes to this journal by this date. But, as hyperbolic as it seems, the Micromatic brought me back to feeling like that kid again. To discovery. To being one of the first people to see this thing since its original owner let it go. To feeling the urge to respect that legacy and tell its story.\n\nFinally, does anybody know what u/admirable-nobody-946 loves or wants? I'm out to find and buy him something bad ass. If you make an awesome brush or you have some sort of ubobtainium thing that he might like, please let me know. My eyes, ears, and wallet are open.\n\nHave a great day, friends.",

My earlier trust was with L2++, which though very efficient, due to the double step chamfers was a tad too much. The aggression was a tad above what I was comfortable with. But L2 is absolutely perfect, paired with a Statum blade it easily sliced through my stubble eliminating repeat strokes. I had to perform a couple of touch ups in my trouble spots. Will pair this with a few more (sharper) blades in the upcoming days to gauge the full spectrum for this one!",

Maybe a touch to light but I think it a great shaver. I plan on shaving with it everyday till AA. Probably should have used a fresh blade but the Astra is still going strong so I switched it over from the Gamechanger.\n\nMy Sea Ice Lime showing a lot of the bottom of the tub but its holding on.

The Personna blade came out with only a bit of prying; the Fromm blade seemes more snug going in. I wish I compared the two side by side, but during the shave they definitely felt different. The Fromm blade also seemed like it was not as tall; I felt like I needed to hold the razor at a steeper angle with it for it to cut. The sound was also different in pitch; a lower pitch. I needed a third pass today with this blade. I thought I nicked myself slightly, but it healed up almost immediately and no feedback from the splash. Debating splash vs balm for August; especially since I'll be on the road a bit, the plastic balm container may be safer than the glass bottle.\n\nShared from [My Shave Den for iOS](https://apps.apple.com/app/1581646387)",

Also, the Oumo Rorschach in my Dogwood is not set deep enough, so I moved it to this handle which allows me to set it at the proper depth. The results were quite good, and I think I will probably be keeping it this way going forward. I just need a new know for the Dogwood, which only has a 16mm deep hole, so I am not sure what to do there.\n\nCatie's Bubbles Premium is so good, and Crangere is awesome.

Can't wait to try the latter, it smells fantastic. In fact, I would say a lot of you folks would really go for this scent. It has cedarwood, pine, tea tree, and other essential oils. It smells like, and I could be way off, Brut? Something my dad would wear when I was a kid in the 1990s. I know this scent but I cannot place it.\n\nTea blend is a collaboration with Harney and Sons and the Ancient Order of Hibernians (a group operating since the later 1800s to protect Irish Catholic Churches, promote Irish American heritage, and push for Irish Independence.) It is a terrific Irish Breakfast tea, lol. Have a great day, friends.\n\n$ Discord",

It's a beautiful piece of shaving equipment and it's very, very heavy. This might be the heaviest razor I've ever used. For an AC razor, it also has a head that seems disproportionate in comparison to the blade, unlike the Cobra Classic I had for many years with a nice, sleek head. I set the adjustment to 5, hit the slick Mike's lather and had a nice, smooth shave. The size of the head created a bit of the challenge for the top lip on my WTG pass, but where I do the top lip side to side on my XTG pass, it was ok. We'll see what tomorrow brings with this razor. I'll probably bump the adjustment up to 6 for the hell of it.\n\nTime for some coffee, which doesn't require any adjustment to.

I previously used a sample when I was experimenting with shaving at work (didn't work out very well, crappy setup and everyone looked at me weird), and that was also when I still really sucked at lathering, so it's never gotten a fair shot.\n\nI really had my lather game on point today, it turned out so perfect. I think Will has previously said his soap can be on the thirstier side, which, as I'm still working on getting my lather skills, was very much appreciated. None of this \"oh you put in one drop too much? Well sucks to be you then\". So it was very forgiving, and I got it to a good point.\n\nMan, today was such a nice, smooth shave. Soap was wonderfully slick, lots of good leftover slickness for my second pass, and got a very good, almost BBS, 0-irritation shave today. Also my second or third shave with this Shark blade, it's been nice.\n\nVery very content, and my neck isn't screaming at me today so I'm very very happy :)",

My first impression is that it's a neat gimmick, but that's about it. It didn't shave particularly well for me and it seemed awkward trying to figure out the best way to hold the thing. I feel like I have way better control with a regular razor handle. That's probably because I have infinitely more experience with them though. I could see the awkwardness disappearing after multiple uses. I've never been impressed with any half DE razor I've used and this one is no different in regards to the shave. I think a DE blade is meant to be curved in the razor to provide extra rigidity and thus a smoother shave. I'll give it one more go before I pass it along to see if there is something I missed, but I doubt it...\n\nHave an excellent day all!",

Unfortunately the today's shave was spoiled a bit with the GEM MicroMatic, which I don't quite have a handle on yet. I ended up with some pretty good razor burn on my neck and a couple of weepers. I have never liked the idea of AA, but I may consider trying to use this razor daily in August to see if I can dial it in for myself. Today's shave is not inspiring confidence in that direction, I have to admit.\n\n$Discord",

Earlier this Summer we poured Chardonnay for an event that featured large format bottles.

No nicks/irritation. Another bloodless shave with a Feather blade on plate 2. The razor/blade combo on that setting has been awesome for me so far. It's 94 degrees with a heat index of 102 in my area right now, hence the soap and splash choices for today. They contain menthol in case you don't know. I'm 100% happy with both the results and how well this menthol shave on this extremely hot day went. Overall, great shave heading into the weekend. Stay cool out there.",

After two uses, I'm just not that wild about this base or scent. It's alright. It's nice to have a sample, but it isn't something that I would purchase any of (though Apples of Aetherwood does intrigue me).\n\nA recent purchase on the zaar came with a B&M bay rum aftershave sample. I thought it paired nicely. Both are citrus forward, sweeter bay rums. Not my preference, but both are well-done scents. The Royall brought more of the West Indies Bay and spices that I crave.

Yesterday, the brass Overlander. Today the Kavre CB. If I had to choose one of the two, I guess I would choose the CB. More flexibility with the various plates. I don't mind the exposed blade tabs. And the C plate is really a sweet spot, slightly better and closer shave than the Overlander. Have a great day!",

My mother-in-law passed away at 2:50 this afternoon on the one year anniversary of my sister-in-law's funeral. It came quicker than we expected, but things seemed needlessly long at times. Her pain and suffering are now through. As for us, Mrs_D will still get some time to herself this weekend and Junior_D and I will still get our Brickyard 400 weekend, because my mother-in-law would have insisted that we be happy as planned.

I did not pick it up off the soap, but I did notice a smoke accord in the splash. Otherwise, I'll need more uses of this to try to sort out the fragrance. The soap base appears to be vegan. I don't see any tallow in the ingredients. It is dense, low structure and takes hydration well.",

Up today, the Timeless Ti .95. It's incredibly smooth and mild for a .95 blade gap. Easy three pass BBS. The only downside at all to this particular razor is its bulky head, which I find similar to the Rockwell 6S. But whereas that razor (though excellent) I find to be like the shaving equivalent of an SUV, the timeless is like a Rolls-Royce. This is probably my favorite handle on any of my razors, the Timeless Crown handle. It's still a distant second to my Legacy, though, which handles like a Lamborghini. And oh yeah, FG is awesome.\n\n$Discord",

On the one hand, I got probably the best overall shave from an open blade ever, but on the other hand I did cut myself a couple of times. Forcing the offhand is problematic for me and I also just can't seem to get under the nose very well. I feel like it's something that just have to do daily to get better, but I am not sure my face can take that much abuse while I learn. Still, I am seeing some progress, no matter how small, so I'll keep trying whenever I feel my face is up to it.\n\n$Discord",

I don't think this razor is nearly as aggressive as the lore would have you believe. I've used DEs that were far more likely to cut me. The true challenge of the MMOC is adjusting to the harshness of GEM blades. When sharp, they mow down hair like nobody's business. They're much thicker and more rigid than other blades. When they get dull, they can feel scrapy, but they can still give a fairly comfortable shave if you're familiar with them. Still, it's much easier than a SR. It's probably time to toss this blade. I don't usually put so many shaves on these.\n\n$Discord",

I know I can seem hyperbolic sometimes, but Barnegat Bay is truly special. It had everything I wanted in a bay rum.\n\nThe scent, built on just essential oils, features a very thoughtful use of patchouli (unique for a bay rum) and citrus to foreground the Pimenta Racemosa and spices, not to compete with them. It is, in my opinion, beautifully balanced and proves that soap makers do not need to be afraid to feature the spices or try to counter them with overly sweet notes. I'm a diabetic anyway, I don't prefer the sweeter bay rums.\n\nThe base was lovely. For me, Barnegat Bay is up there with Mike's and will feature heavily in my rotation going forward. Great value too, $14 for 4 oz.\n\nI can see why Catie's Bubbles is so popular here. I'm a full convert. But, as special as this shave soap is, the service from Chris was even better. He's good people. I hope your shave was as good as mine. Have an awesome Sunday, friends.\n\n$discord",

And its got just a enough menthol to cool things down on a nasty day.\n\nAnother nice shave with the batch 3. I noticed on my first couple shaves the razor seemed to drag a little. On the discord u/JoboozeRum suggested putting my index finger near the head. He said the razor is so light it could be bouncing off the face. It did seem to help. Maybe it was my imagination but it did seem to cut down on the drag. So thanks to you sir.\n\nnow for continued coffee. have a great shave day my friends.\n\n$Discord",

It's harder to tell that they are cutting; but harder to cut myself with them. I wonder what those Kismet ones are like; however I can't easily get them locally and they are very expensive in North America shipped from the USA. I wish there was a middle ground between the Personna blades and the Fromm; the Personna coating seems to fade after about 3 shaves and they are left extremely sharp but somewhat unforgiving, so it's easy to get phantom nicks because you can't feel the blade. The Fromm blades you can feel, but I wish they were a tad sharper.\n\nShared from [My Shave Den for iOS](https://apps.apple.com/app/1581646387)",

The feather blade works quite well with BB, but the blade was finished by the end of the third pass as it was struggling a bit during touch ups. Nacet is possibly the best blade which has worked in BB for me. I have hence trashed the blade after the shave.\n\nI have always loved the Yaqi Sagrada brush, it comes closest to feeling like a boar brush in Synths for me. Always whips up a thick creamy lather in no time.",

The razor is superb. The weight is perfect for me, and of course the fit and finish is incredible. There's quite a bit of blade feel, which I prefer, but that greatly increases the importance of blade choice and lather quality. Astras aren't one of my favorite blades, but they were the ones provided with the razor, and others have spoken highly of them, so I thought I'd give them a go. The result was a good shave, but maybe a bit more tuggy than I'd like. Although the blade may have contributed, I think it was mostly poor lather building on my part - I'm looking forward to fixing the lather and getting a better shave tomorrow.\n\nFirst time using Floïd was a joy. The scent is fresh and wonderful and it left my skin feeling great. The menthol in the scent profile took a bit of getting used to, but I think I liked it. Also looking forward to trying it again tomorrow.\n\n🪒 Many Happy Shaves! 🪒",

That's 31 days in a row with high temperatures above 90 degrees. This is the price we pay for only 4-6 weeks of relatively cold weather each winter. I have a bunch of errands to run this morning and should probably cut the grass later today so a little bit of citronella in my aftershave isn't a bad idea.\n\nThe wife and I had a busy weekend, volunteering on Thursday and Saturday for the Nashville Wine Auction. They do a big dinner and auction on Saturday night. The biggest bid I entered was $50,000. We ended up raising $2.6 million during the event this year.\n\nOn to the shaving part....\n\nThis scent might not be everyone's cup of tea, but I happen to like citronella so there's that. The sheep mutton base is fabulous. I would like to suggest that Rod do more sheep base options, even if they only come in the 3 oz versions that he does for Black Friday.\n\n2 easy peasy passes. Remember, Friday is August 1st, so get ready to rumble....\n\nShared from [My Shave Den for iOS](https://apps.apple.com/app/1581646387)",

The Orbit soap/splash duo did the job of beating the heat as it should. This is also my last shave of freedom as I'll be doing AA next month. Wish me luck on AA.

Once he raised his prices a few months back, I swore off the brand. I have also heard less than pleasant things about the artisan. While I still have two bottles of his bay rum aftershave left, I feel comfortable that the other bay rum aftershaves I have are superior and I will not miss anything once these two are gone.\n\nHowever, I also have a sample of Fine's Barber Blue (a dupe of Floid Blue) that I am very partial to. Now, with Stirling's Cool Blue, I can have a quality shave soap as well as an aftershave and EDT that dupes Floid Blue even better than Fine does. I will buy all three once I finish this smush and sample. Now, I can fully swear off Fine Accoutrements without feeling like I am missing anything. Thank you u/bostonphototourist for making yet another great scent.",

Just for fun I'm going to give it a try until the start of AA.\n\nAlso in preparation for AA I'm revisiting some favorites that I haven't used in a while. There is a reason Hygge is at the top of my all time list. I haven't used it in quite a while, so it was a total pleasure shaving with this wonderful soap. I thought for a moment about using the Hygge EdP, but thought Cool Blue would be a good match, and wouldn't be so heavy in this muggy weather.\n\nEnjoy some coffee or tea, and have a good day.\n\nFace WTG ATG Cleanup.\nNeck WTG XTG XTG.\n\n$discord",

Before I head into 31 straight days with the Legacy, I'm using each of my modern razors. The vintage razors will happen another month. The 🐐works great for me. But it's no SS 34C. Inspired by at best. More blade fell than the 34C for sure. I like the slightly longer handle. The 34C is quite short. I'd call the blade feel somewhere between a GC .76 and .84. I can get BBS just a bit quicker than the 34C. And about the same as the GC .84. Hard to tell if I would prefer the GOAT to the Game Changer. It's close. I, Rich Moose is nice. A good classic, clean, slightly nostalgic old school scent. Have a great day!",

The apex held up well after the first shave. My Mikawa progression arrives today, and I plan to run it through the full set with Botan, Tenjou, Mejiro, and Koma.\n\nIt feels like I finally have my pressure control dialed in.

Time to box it up and send it along. Final thoughts on this razor? It was cool to try this. This isn't a razor or potentially even brand I would have gotten to experiment with but for this passaround. The shaves were definitely efficient and smooth at setting 6. The build and tolerances of this razor, especially with a slider for adjustment are fantastic. However, I felt like my hand was getting tired by the end of a shave because of the weight of this razor and I have several stainless steel razors. I also rip through a shave in under 10 minutes. I think the thinner handle along with the weight was responsible for this. Finally, for me, the head is just a tad too big for an AC razor, especially under the nose. Conclusion: While this was a fun week of shaves, I'm glad it's not creating a desire to finally wrap all of those coins on my dresser, return a few bags of bottles and maybe donate some plasma to come up with the $500+ dollars and marital harmony will continue.\n\nThe price for coffee is going to increase starting August 1 thanks to tariffs. Maybe I'll keep all those coins on my dresser to pay for that instead. I'm glad I stocked up on several bags before we take the kick to the nuts and pay more for the pleasure of waking up. The taste of cheaper coffee this morning is delicious. Try to enjoy your day and remember to be kind to one another.\n\n$Discord",

Leather was not to my taste and I was happy to pass that along to another sub member.\n\nThese are wonderful scents, u/hawns. Excellent work! I really have to hand it to the folks in this sub.

The Simpson brush was great, took a minute to get the water where I wanted it for lathering but once dialed in it was really nice. Biggest downside was the bulb didn't fit in my vintage scuttle for dipping back into the hot water.\n\nThe soap and splash from Elysian was really nice good fresh scent. The Cashmere base is excellent, though I question it's value proposition. The base falls a bit short of the top tiers in my life. Tusk, Omnibus, F Base (Ethos) are the tops in my collection currently. I will say it's comparable to the Kodiak base in terms of quality not quite S tier more like an A+ tier.\n\nRazor I have issues with, luckily picked it up basically NIB for half the price of buying from Supply or I'd be mad. First, the proprietary blade thing is just annoying period. They don't suck, but they aren't great. Biggest issue is that with 3-4 days growth it clogs like a total SOB and it's either constant rinsing or turns into a pulling machine. If you have fine hair or shave on the daily this could be a good choice as a travel, or efficient fire and forget razor when you don't have time for your whole process. But I had to tag in my still king of head shaving my Leaf with fresh blades.",

If you've ever watched Jaws, Captain Quint was a survivor of the sinking and spoke about his experience. The ship was returning from Tinian, after delivering the \"Little Boy\" atomic bomb. The ship sank so fast that they weren't able to get out a distress call. The mission was so secret that they weren't declared overdue for nearly a week. Out of a crew of 1200, only 300 survived the sinking and sharks that killed most of the crew.\n\nToday's shave is Cannonball! One of the sets that would be a leading contender for AA if I hadn't jumped on the Bay Rum express that is Mike's. It's a great scent. However when it's gone, Rope Swing is waiting in the wings to take its place as a cool and refreshing Summer treat.\n\n2 passes. I think this might be the razor I use next month.

New Soap from Henri et Victoria via Maggards because I won something ; )\n\nHilariously, I live 20 minutes away from H+V, so this soap left home to travel to Michigan, only to come right back.\n\nI've sampled it before, but I find the tobacco is a lot more forward in the full bowl - maybe even stronger than my Trail Tobacco from Macduff's (which was my splash today, and is, as mentioned, maybe a bit more anise-forward than I'd like)\n\nFirst time with a Voshkod blade, not going to lie I am mostly about the art on the box, makes me think of the cold war in the romantic way only someone born in the late 80s can offer. Enjoyed the feel though. Some irritation but that's been the case with most of my shaves lately, I'd spend more time dialing in with DEs but I'll be going back to straights in literally two days so I'd rather just focus on that\n\nPrep: Hot tap water\n\nBrush: Vulfix 2236S\n\nRazor: Merkur 39C [22]\n\nBlade: Voshkod\n\nSoap: Henri et Victoria Cognac and Cuban Cigar Triple Milled\n\nPost: Macduff's Trail Tobacco splash",

Will I make it more than single digits this year before giving up? We shall see. What I know for sure is that before a month of austerity I need to go out with a truly ostentatious shave. My choice of razor was my Max Sprecher in abalone scales. Despite getting this secondhand it's still my most expensive razor by far. I tend not to use it as much as my others, and I'm not really sure why, as it shaves very well with the edge put on by my Shobudani Asagi Awasedo.\n\nFor my software choice today it was my first time trying this vendor. Saw them pop up on Facebook and Reddit as a fairly new-to-shaving-products vendor, and the scent profile of this particular one intrigued me too much not to buy. Those of you who know me know I'm obsessed with vetiver, in no small part due to the diligence of /u/c_bubbles putting it into 75% of his scent catalogue. One of my favorites of those scents was Dirty Prose, a scent done as an r/wetshaving exclusive some years ago (and unlikely to return if the price of Haitian vetiver continues increasing). This scent off the puck was very pleasant. Mostly rose, but a brighter presentation than Prose overall. Once you lather you smell the vetiver immediately. It's got that nutty profile like you get from a tub of Marshlands or Mike's Vetiver. Performance wise I felt this performed excellently. Plenty slick for multiple passes with plenty of residual slickness that I could do cleanup passes without fear of dry runs. Aftershave was also very pleasant, with no alcohol burn, and felt similar to the CL toners in its stickiness. I'd say probably apply with slightly damp hands for best effect.\n\nDoes this live up to its competition of Prose? I'd say they're two sides of the same coin. Much in the way that Dranks was a darker more Gourmand-y version of Boissons Sur La Porche, Prose is a darker, earthier version of what this scent attempts. I know with its performance I'll definitely keep an eye on their Instagram for new offerings in the wetshaving space!\n\n$discord",

The last time I used it, almost a year ago, it was super disappointing. Today's shave was much better, but still this old soap base is lacking compared to modern bases, particularly in the post shave department. Sounds like I should move on from it, so I probably will.\n\n$Discord",

I should have started with it on the first day. Lesson learned for next time. This razor is now my favorite modern DE razor, edging out my Henson AL-13 Aggressive. I think it performs about the same as my Henson, but it looks and feels better in my hand. Plus there are lots of little things that I like better about this razor.\n\nHere's what I like:\n* looks gorgeous - the nickel plating gives it a beautiful sheen\n* shaves fantastically - I like the blade feel, and once paired with the right blade, the results were a BBS with no irritation\n* light weight - I'm a huge fan of light weight aluminum razors that are easy to grip loosely to flow with the curves of my face\n* precision manufacturing with tight tolerances\n* no blade slop - the use of oblong tabs instead of round posts, as well as the aforementioned manufacturing precision, keep the blade aligned perfectly in the head\n* the blade alignment tabs are long enough to keep the entire head aligned even when loosened from the handle to rinse (this is one of the things that drives me a little crazy when loosening the head on many razors - I loosen the head to rinse and then the top and bottom plates need to be realigned)\n* it's super easy to rinse - the holes on the bottom plate are big and allow a ton of water to flow through\n* it's easy to load/unload/position blades in the head - the width of the head allows *just* a tiny bit of the blade \"ears\" to poke through, enough to grip the blade but not enough to poke/slice my fingers when I grip the head to tighten the handle\n* the handle is a joy to hold - I like the thickness, and the ridges and the knob at the bottom make it easy to grip\n* the cost - I'm sure the Titanium and Stainless versions of the Blackbird are worth the price, but I just can't justify spending that much money on a razor\n\nThese are, of course, my personal opinions, which is why I say it's my favorite modern DE razor, not the best razor; but I would recommend it without reservation to someone who prefers lightweight razors.\n\nNow on to Austere August!\n\n🪒 Many Happy Shaves! 🪒",

Nothing can ever replace an original, but we really feel that the dry-down in this one just about nails it. As you might expect, this scent has green, bergamot, rosemary, lemon, orange and coriander for top notes. In the middle are notes of geranium, lavender, clove, and cedar. The base consists of moss tonka bean, and patchouli notes.\"\n\nMe: May not be exact, but gets enjoyably close to the Irisch Moos scent I remember, and the AS that I have around somewhere.\n\nLather... This was a well-hydrated lather that oozed of my face and brush while applying. It was so slick and performed well, and still, due to the mutton base, felt so luxurious while doing it. And left my face feeling amazing afterwards.\n\nHydration: Perfect *(for me)*\n+ 29 ml (5.9 tsp) added to build the lather\n+ = 5 passes of lather\n\nBowl: Shiny Memories Bowl\n\n#### ䷀ Brush Notes\n*^(Semogue - Barbear Classico Cerda 22mm ‹2 uses›)*\n\nGreat. pretty soft tips, and nice comfy splay.\n\n----\n*During the Shave Feel*:\n*Cheeks*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*Neck*: Felt blade but comfortable\n*After the Shave Closeness*:\n*Cheeks*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n*Neck*: Near BBS - About as close as I'll ever get\n\n----\n\n**Shavers Map** - [here it is](http://www.freezingcode.com/shaving/shaversMap.cfm) *and also in the sub's sidebar.*\n\n**Ending of Blades Ledger** - [entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYqXSDujvoO1hVl_wSKMeETWdxFnYJCrqr0zU7FStBdIMrfg/viewform) and [the data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-oqIPSHKcb0EYd9OxL2n-R4Y6yxqid6-NGYS_4_ljU/edit?usp=sharing)",

      "body": "So I just discovered the Leaf razor, and the Twig razor too and they seem amazing. I have a few questions and hopefully some of you who has this razor can help me out.\n\nFirstly is the Leaf razor good for shaving a man's private parts? The thing looks pretty huge, I worry about using the Leaf to shave hard to reach corners. I also see that you don't need to put all 3 blades in, and you can change it up. Should I also pick up the Twig razor for private parts?\n\nAs for the razor refills, I see the Leaf website sells blades that are basically just DE blades snapped in half. Can the Leaf razor take actual traditional SE blades?\n\nAlso I'd rather not snap DE blades in half myself, are there any good pre snapped DE blades I can purchase?"
