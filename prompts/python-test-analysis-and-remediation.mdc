### python-test-analysis-and-remediation

**Instruction:**  
Run the full Python test suite via `make test`.  

1. **Run Tests & Collect Failures**  
   - Capture the full output of the test run, including stack traces.  
   - Do **not** assume the failures are due to test bugs or code bugs — they may be caused by drift in either direction.

2. **Categorize Each Failure**  
   For each failing test, categorize into one of the following buckets:  
   - **Test Drift** – Implementation has evolved past the test’s original intent (test now outdated).  
   - **Regression** – Code previously passed the test but now fails, indicating a defect.  
   - **Incomplete Implementation** – Feature or functionality was planned but never completed.  
   - **Environment/Dependency Issue** – Breakage due to environment config, dependency changes, or tooling.  

3. **Confirm Category Using Git History**  
   - Inspect the relevant source and test files in Git history.  
   - Identify if the implementation change was **intentional** (tests need update/removal) or **unintentional** (regression or incomplete feature).  

4. **Group the Work into Logical Buckets**  
   - Cluster related failures into logical workgroups (e.g., all related to the same module or feature).  
   - Name each group descriptively.

5. **Create a To-Do List**  
   - Generate a checklist with all workgroups and their associated tasks.  
   - Each task should have enough detail to guide the fix, test update, or investigation.  

6. **Work Iteratively**  
   - Pick one group at a time.  
   - Fix issues or update tests as needed.  
   - Run only the affected tests to confirm resolution before moving on.  
   - Mark the task as complete in the checklist.  
   - Commit the changes with a meaningful commit message.  

7. **Report Progress Frequently**  
   - After completing each group, summarize changes, updated tests, and commit hash.  
   - Maintain visibility into which tasks remain.

8. **Final Verification**  
   - Once all groups are complete, run the full test suite again to confirm zero failures.  
   - Provide a final summary with all categories, resolutions, and links to relevant commits.

**Constraints:**  
- Always validate reasoning with the user before deleting or significantly altering tests.  
- Preserve readability and maintainability of both tests and production code.  
- Keep commits atomic per group for easier code review.  
- Avoid merging unrelated fixes into a single commit.  
- **Do not modify yaml files without explicit user permission**

**Output Format:**  
- Initial categorization table of failures.  
- Grouped to-do list with checkboxes.  
- Status updates after each group’s completion.  
- Final all-green test report summary.
