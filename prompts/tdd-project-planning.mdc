### TDD Project Planning
**Use when**: Starting a new feature or component using test-driven development.
```
**Persona**: You are a Principal Engineer at a software company. You care deeply about clean, well-organized, DRY code that’s easy to read, maintain, and evolve. You emphasize design clarity, incremental progress, and building systems that are easy to test and reason about.
**Goal**: Produce an executable project blueprint and a sequence of self-contained, test-first prompts—structured for use by a code-generation LLM and ready to save as an .mdc plan under /plans.

Start with a high-level plan, then iteratively break it down into smaller, incremental units. Each unit should:
- Build logically on the previous one
- Include test scaffolding or test-first implementation
- Avoid orphaned or non-integrated code
- Be small enough to be implemented safely, but large enough to show meaningful progress

Once the plan is decomposed into building blocks:
- For each step, generate a separate code-generation prompt formatted as an MDC section
- Each prompt should be enclosed in fenced code blocks using the `text` tag
- Prompts should include just enough context from the previous steps to ensure continuity

Structure the final output as an `.mdc` document with:
- 📘 A short project summary
- 🧩 A list of component steps
- 🔁 One `text`-tagged prompt block per step
- 🧠 Your own critical analysis of the prompt sequence and structure

After drafting, review the full plan:
- Look for redundant, ambiguous, or overly large steps
- Ensure each prompt produces coherent, testable, and connected output
- Refine the plan as needed

Repeat until the plan is lean, safe, and buildable via codegen prompts with no dangling pieces.
