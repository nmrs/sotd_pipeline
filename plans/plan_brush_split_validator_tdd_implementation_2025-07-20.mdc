## Session Notes

### 2025-07-20: Data Analysis and Optimization Decision

**Data Analysis Findings:**
- **Actual Dataset Sizes**: ~2,500-3,000 records per month (not 1000+ as assumed)
- **File Sizes**: 2-15MB per month (very manageable)
- **Total Dataset**: ~100 months = ~250,000 total brush records
- **Performance Reality**: Sequential processing is faster than parallel (61% slower with parallelization)

**Key Decisions:**
1. **Removed DataProcessingPipeline**: Premature optimization for non-existent problem
2. **Updated Step 7**: Focus on actual needs (error handling, progress indicators)
3. **Leverage Existing Performance**: Sequential processing at ~1,064 records/sec is already excellent
4. **Focus on Real Problems**: Virtualized table foundation and error handling

**Lessons Applied:**
- Follow project's performance lessons: "Sequential processing remains fastest"
- Avoid premature optimization: "Record-level parallelization doesn't help"
- Use data-driven decisions: Actual dataset analysis revealed over-engineering

**Next Steps:**
- Proceed with Step 8 (Error Handling) and Step 10 (Virtualized Table Foundation)
- Keep simple, efficient approach that's already working
- Focus on user experience improvements rather than performance optimization
