# Soap Sample Detection Enrichment Implementation Plan

**Plan Date**: 2025-08-18  
**Type**: Feature Implementation Plan  
**Status**: READY_FOR_IMPLEMENTATION  

## üìò Project Summary

Implement a soap sample detection enrichment step that extracts sample information from original soap strings (before normalization). This follows the same pattern as blade count extraction: strip the normalized string from the original, parse the remainder for sample indicators, and provide structured sample data for downstream aggregation.

**Key Benefits**:
- Moves sample detection from match phase (where it was ineffective) to enrich phase (where it can work on original text)
- Provides structured sample data for aggregation and reporting
- Follows established enrichment patterns (blade count extraction)
- Enables sample usage statistics and analysis

## üß© Component Steps

1. **Create SoapSampleEnricher class** - Core enrichment logic following BaseEnricher pattern
2. **Implement sample pattern extraction** - Parse remainder text for sample indicators
3. **Add sample enricher to enrich phase** - Integrate with existing enrichment workflow
4. **Create sample aggregator** - Aggregate sample usage statistics
5. **Add sample aggregation to aggregate phase** - Include in monthly/annual aggregation
6. **Update tests and validation** - Ensure comprehensive test coverage

## üîÅ Implementation Prompts

### Step 1: Create SoapSampleEnricher Class

```text
Create a new SoapSampleEnricher class in `sotd/enrich/soap_sample_enricher.py` that follows the BaseEnricher pattern. This enricher should:

1. Inherit from BaseEnricher
2. Target the "soap" field
3. Apply to any record with a matched soap
4. Use the same pattern as BladeCountEnricher: strip normalized from original, parse remainder

The enricher should detect these sample patterns:
- (sample) ‚Üí sample_type: "sample"
- (sample #23) ‚Üí sample_type: "sample", sample_number: 23  
- (sample 5 of 10) ‚Üí sample_type: "sample", sample_number: 5, total_samples: 10
- (tester) ‚Üí sample_type: "tester"
- "H&M - Seville - sample" ‚Üí sample_type: "sample" (after stripping "H&M - Seville")

Output structure should match:
```json
"enriched": {
    "sample_type": "sample",
    "sample_number": 23,
    "total_samples": 10,
    "extraction_remainder": "(sample #23)",
    "_enriched_by": "SoapSampleEnricher",
    "_extraction_source": "remainder_parsing"
}
```

Use the same remainder parsing approach as BladeCountEnricher: find normalized text in original, extract remainder, parse for sample patterns.
```

### Step 2: Implement Sample Pattern Extraction

```text
Implement the core sample pattern extraction logic in the SoapSampleEnricher. This should:

1. Use regex patterns to detect sample indicators in remainder text
2. Handle numeric sample numbers: (sample #23), (sample 5 of 10)
3. Handle basic sample types: (sample), (tester)
4. Handle trailing sample indicators: "Brand - Scent - sample"
5. Return structured sample data with proper validation

The extraction should be robust and handle edge cases:
- Multiple sample indicators in same text
- Invalid numeric patterns
- Mixed case variations
- Whitespace variations

Follow the same validation patterns as blade count extraction for numeric fields.
```

### Step 3: Add Sample Enricher to Enrich Phase

```text
Integrate the SoapSampleEnricher into the existing enrich phase workflow. This involves:

1. Adding the enricher to the enrich phase's enricher list
2. Ensuring it runs after soap matching but before aggregation
3. Updating enrich phase tests to include sample enrichment
4. Validating that sample data flows correctly through the pipeline

The enricher should be added to the same location as BladeCountEnricher and other product enrichers.
```

### Step 4: Create Sample Aggregator

```text
Create a new SoapSampleAggregator in `sotd/aggregate/aggregators/core/soap_sample_aggregator.py` that:

1. Follows the BaseAggregator pattern
2. Aggregates sample usage statistics by sample type
3. Provides metrics like:
   - Total sample shaves
   - Sample usage by type (sample vs tester)
   - Sample usage by brand/scent
   - Sample completion tracking (sample #5 of 10)

The aggregator should integrate with existing soap aggregation and provide sample-specific insights.
```

### Step 5: Add Sample Aggregation to Aggregate Phase

```text
Integrate the SoapSampleAggregator into the aggregate phase workflow. This involves:

1. Adding sample aggregation to the monthly aggregation processor
2. Including sample data in annual aggregation
3. Updating aggregate phase tests to validate sample aggregation
4. Ensuring sample metrics are included in final output files

The sample aggregation should be added alongside other core product aggregations.
```

### Step 6: Update Tests and Validation

```text
Create comprehensive test coverage for the soap sample enrichment feature. This includes:

1. Unit tests for SoapSampleEnricher with various sample patterns
2. Integration tests for the complete enrich ‚Üí aggregate flow
3. Test data validation for sample extraction accuracy
4. Performance tests for sample aggregation with large datasets
5. Edge case testing for malformed sample indicators

All tests should follow the project's testing patterns and ensure the feature works correctly in production scenarios.
```

## üß† Critical Analysis

**Architecture Strengths**:
- ‚úÖ Follows established enrichment patterns (blade count extraction)
- ‚úÖ Proper separation of concerns (match phase for matching, enrich phase for metadata)
- ‚úÖ Reuses proven remainder parsing approach
- ‚úÖ Integrates cleanly with existing pipeline phases

**Implementation Considerations**:
- **Sample pattern complexity**: The regex patterns need to handle various formats while avoiding false positives
- **Numeric validation**: Sample numbers should be validated for realistic ranges (similar to blade use counts)
- **Performance impact**: Sample aggregation adds another aggregator to the pipeline
- **Data consistency**: Sample data must flow correctly through all phases

**Risk Mitigation**:
- **Incremental implementation**: Each step builds on the previous, allowing for early validation
- **Test-first approach**: Comprehensive testing ensures reliability
- **Pattern reuse**: Leveraging proven blade count extraction patterns reduces risk
- **Integration testing**: Validating complete data flow prevents phase misalignment

**Dependencies**:
- BaseEnricher infrastructure (already exists)
- Enrich phase workflow (already exists)
- BaseAggregator infrastructure (already exists)
- Aggregate phase workflow (already exists)

**Success Criteria**:
- Sample detection works on original text (before normalization)
- Sample data is properly structured and validated
- Sample aggregation provides meaningful insights
- Feature integrates seamlessly with existing pipeline
- All tests pass and performance remains acceptable

This plan provides a clear, incremental path to implementing soap sample detection enrichment while maintaining the project's architectural principles and quality standards.
