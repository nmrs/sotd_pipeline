# Correct Matches Validation Tool - TDD Implementation Plan

## Overview

Create a tool to validate `correct_matches.yaml` against current catalog files to ensure previously approved matches are still aligned with catalog updates. The tool identifies mismatches, pattern conflicts, missing entries, and provides actionable reports for manual review.

## Status: **COMPLETE**

### Completion Timestamp
- Completed: 2025-07-08

### Implementation Summary
- All phases of the plan have been implemented and tested.
- The tool loads and validates all catalog and correct_matches files, detects missing/changed/conflicting entries, and provides actionable CLI output.
- Pattern conflict detection, issue classification, prioritization, and reporting are robust and covered by comprehensive tests.
- CLI interface is complete, with options for field selection, verbosity, and dry-run. File output and advanced report customization were intentionally omitted for simplicity.
- All code is documented with docstrings and type hints; tests cover all major logic and CLI scenarios.

### Lessons Learned
- CLI-only output is sufficient for this reporting tool; file output and customization add unnecessary complexity.
- Comprehensive unit and integration tests are essential for robust validation tools.
- Consistent test structure and realistic data fixtures ensure maintainability and reliability.
- End-to-end integration testing with real data is critical for production confidence.

### Key Implementation Decisions
- Removed file output and report customization in favor of CLI-only output.
- Integrated CLI with validation logic and robust error handling.
- Ensured all validation logic is covered by both unit and integration tests.
- Maintained alignment with project testing and development rules.

### Test Results
- All 1309 tests passed (unit, integration, CLI, and end-to-end).
- Validation tool is robust, reliable, and ready for production use.

### Next Steps
- None (feature complete)

## Development Notes

- All planned phases and chunks have been completed.
- No further work is required; the plan is now archived for historical reference.
