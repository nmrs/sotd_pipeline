# Mismatch Identification Tool Implementation Plan

## TDD Project Planning

1. **Draft a Detailed Blueprint**:
   - **Objective**: Create a comprehensive plan for building the Mismatch Identification Tool using TDD.
   - **Steps**:
     - Define the core functionalities: mismatch identification, visual indicators, and interactive filtering.
     - Outline the modules: Data Processing, Visual Indicator, Interactive Filtering, Error Handling, and Documentation.
     - Specify the key decisions: CLI design, technology stack, and performance optimization.

2. **Break into Iterative Chunks**:
   - **Objective**: Divide the project into small, manageable tasks.
   - **Steps**:
     - Milestone 1: Design and Prototyping
       - Task 1: Design CLI prompts and options.
       - Task 2: Prototype visual indicators.
       - Task 3: Validate design with stakeholders.
     - Milestone 2: Core Functionality Development
       - Task 1: Develop data processing module.
       - Task 2: Implement mismatch identification logic.
       - Task 3: Develop interactive filtering module.
     - Milestone 3: Performance Optimization
       - Task 1: Optimize data processing.
       - Task 2: Conduct performance testing.
     - Milestone 4: Error Handling and Documentation
       - Task 1: Implement error handling.
       - Task 2: Develop user guide.
     - Milestone 5: Testing and Validation
       - Task 1: Perform unit and integration testing.
       - Task 2: Validate functionality and performance.

3. **Iterate and Refine**:
   - **Objective**: Ensure the steps are right-sized for the project.
   - **Steps**:
     - Review each chunk to ensure it can be implemented safely with strong testing.
     - Adjust the size of tasks to balance progress and complexity.
     - Ensure each task builds on the previous ones and integrates into the overall project.

4. **Provide Prompts for Code Generation**:
   - **Objective**: Prepare prompts for implementing each step in a test-driven manner.
   - **Steps**:
     - Create prompts for each task, ensuring they prioritize best practices and incremental progress.
     - Ensure no orphaned code; each prompt should integrate with previous steps.
     - Separate each prompt section using markdown.

## Detailed Specifications

- **Functionalities**:
  - **Mismatch Identification**: Identify mismatches between matched and original product names, highlighting differences for human review.
  - **Visual Indicators**: Use text-based indicators to show mismatches.
  - **Interactive Filtering**: Allow filtering based on product type or mismatch severity.

- **Data Formats**:
  - Read JSON files from `data/matched/` containing matched and original product data.

## Stakeholder Validation

- Confirm design and prototyping tasks with stakeholders, ensuring CLI design and visual indicators meet user expectations.

## Technology Stack

- **Current Libraries**: Utilize existing libraries like `pandas`, `pyyaml`, and `praw`. Consider additional libraries if needed for performance or visualization.
- **Compatibility**: Ensure compatibility with Python 3.11 and the existing codebase.

## Performance Metrics

- **Loading Time**: Aim for data loading in under 5 seconds, optimizing data handling with `pandas` if necessary.

## Integration with Existing Systems

- Ensure seamless integration with the SOTD Pipeline, particularly the match phase, reading from `data/matched/*.json` without affecting other processes.

## Documentation and User Guide

- Provide clear instructions on launching the tool and available options, including command-line arguments and configuration settings.

## Mismatch Identification Strategies

- **Multiple Regex Matches**: Check if an original string matches additional regex patterns beyond the one it stopped at to identify potential mismatches.

- **Levenshtein Distance**: Calculate the Levenshtein distance between `original` and `matched` strings to flag potential mismatches, especially when the match type is not `exact`.

- **Pattern Confidence Scores**: Assign confidence scores to regex patterns based on historical accuracy or frequency of correct matches. Flag low-confidence matches for review.

- **User Feedback Loop**: Implement a feedback mechanism where users can flag incorrect matches, allowing the system to learn and refine matching algorithms.

- **Visual Indicators**: Use color-coding or annotations in the output to highlight potential mismatches, making it easier for users to spot them.

## Session Notes and Implementation Decisions

### 2025-01-27 Session Notes (Completion)

**Implementation Summary:**
- Implemented `MismatchAnalyzer` as a new analysis tool, extending the existing `AnalysisTool` base class.
- CLI entry point created as `analyze_mismatches.py` following project CLI patterns.
- All mismatch identification strategies (multiple regex, Levenshtein, confidence, visual indicators) are implemented.
- Interactive filtering and CLI options are provided.
- Comprehensive unit tests created and all tests are passing.
- Performance validated: tool is fast and responsive for typical data sizes.
- Error handling and user feedback are robust.

**Lessons Learned:**
- Reusing the existing analysis tool architecture enabled rapid, robust implementation.
- TDD and incremental test development caught edge cases (e.g., Levenshtein logic for empty strings).
- CLI and test patterns from the codebase provided a strong foundation for new tool development.
- Rich library is effective for visual indicators in CLI tools.
- Early test failures on edge cases (empty string distance) highlighted the importance of test-driven bug discovery.

**Next Steps:**
- Document usage in the user guide and README.
- Solicit stakeholder feedback on CLI/UX and visual indicators.
- Monitor for real-world edge cases as the tool is adopted.
