# Bugfix Plan: Missing May 2020 SOTD Threads in Fetch Phase

## Problem Summary
- The pipeline is missing SOTD thread data for May 2020 in all phases (threads, extracted, matched, etc.).
- Manual Reddit search confirms that SOTD threads for May 2020 exist and are discoverable.

## Root Cause Analysis
- The fetch phase uses PRAW to search for threads with queries like `flair:SOTD may may 2020` and `flair:SOTD may may 2020SOTD`.
- Thread titles on Reddit for May 2020 are in the format: `{Day} SOTD Thread - May {DD}, 2020` (e.g., "Tuesday SOTD Thread - May 26, 2020").
- **ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED**: PRAW API error in `sotd/fetch/overrides.py` line 87 - using `submission_id=tid` as keyword argument instead of positional argument.

## Investigation Steps
1. âœ… Run fetch with `--debug` flag to see detailed output
2. âœ… Check search queries and results
3. âœ… Verify thread discovery and filtering
4. âœ… Identify PRAW API error in overrides processing
5. âœ… Test curl method to get real Reddit data

## Solution Implemented
**Fix Applied**: Updated `sotd/fetch/overrides.py` line 87:
- **Before**: `sub = safe_call(reddit.submission, submission_id=tid)`
- **After**: `sub = safe_call(reddit.submission, tid)`

**Result**: 
- âœ… Successfully fetched 31 threads for May 2020
- âœ… Retrieved 2,307 comments
- âœ… Data saved to `data/threads/2020-05.json` (9.7KB, 290 lines)
- âœ… Comments saved to `data/comments/2020-05.json` (2.4MB)

## Using curl for Real Data Analysis
**Command**: 
```bash
curl -s 'https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/search/?q=sotd+may+2020&restrict_sr=1&sort=relevance&t=all'
```

**Real Thread Titles Found**:
- Tuesday SOTD Thread - May 26, 2020
- Tuesday SOTD Thread - May 12, 2020  
- Wednesday SOTD Thread - May 06, 2020
- Wednesday SOTD Thread - May 27, 2020
- Wednesday SOTD Thread - May 13, 2020
- Monday SOTD Thread - May 18, 2020
- Monday SOTD Thread - May 11, 2020
- Wednesday SOTD Thread - May 20, 2020

**Uses for Analysis**:
- Test `parse_thread_date` function with real thread titles
- Verify search query effectiveness
- Create test cases for date parsing
- Debug PRAW search vs web search differences
- Validate thread naming conventions

## Status: âœ… COMPLETED
- **Date**: December 2024
- **Fix**: PRAW API parameter correction in overrides.py
- **Data Recovered**: 31 threads, 2,307 comments for May 2020
- **Next Steps**: Run subsequent pipeline phases (extract, match, enrich, aggregate, report) to process the recovered data

## Step-by-Step Fix Plan
1. âœ… **Investigation**: Run fetch with debug mode
2. âœ… **Root Cause**: Identify PRAW API error in overrides
3. âœ… **Fix**: Update submission() call to use positional argument
4. âœ… **Test**: Verify fetch works and data is saved
5. âœ… **Validation**: Confirm threads and comments are present
6. ðŸ”„ **Next**: Process recovered data through remaining pipeline phases
