# Missing Months Analysis - SOTD Pipeline Data Review

## Summary
- **Actual Data Start**: May 4, 2016 (not May 1, 2016 as previously assumed)
- **Total Expected Months**: 114 (2016-05 to 2025-12)
- **Thread Files Present**: 104
- **Comment Files Present**: 97
- **Missing Threads**: 10 months
- **Missing Comments**: 17 months
- **Missing Both**: 10 months

## Data Availability Discovery
**May 2016 Confirmed**: Manual verification shows May 2016 has SOTD threads starting from May 4:
- 28 threads total (May 4-31, 2016)
- May 1-3, 2016: Confirmed do not exist after exhaustive search
- All created by AutoModerator
- Consistent naming: `{Day} SOTD Thread - May {DD}, 2016`
- Thread IDs: 4htj81 through 4lu5sx (May 4-31 only)

## Critical Missing Data (Both Threads and Comments)

These months are completely missing from the pipeline and need immediate attention:

### 2016 (Historical Data)
- **2016-05**: May 2016 (CONFIRMED EXISTS - needs to be fetched)

### 2017-2019 (Historical Data)
- **2017-05**: May 2017  
- **2017-08**: August 2017
- **2018-05**: May 2018
- **2018-08**: August 2018
- **2019-05**: May 2019
- **2019-08**: August 2019

### 2020-2022 (Recent Data)
- **2020-02**: February 2020
- **2020-08**: August 2020
- **2021-05**: May 2021
- **2022-05**: May 2022

## Missing Only Comments (Threads Present)

These months have thread data but are missing comment data:

### 2025 (Future Data - Expected)
- **2025-06**: June 2025
- **2025-07**: July 2025
- **2025-08**: August 2025
- **2025-09**: September 2025
- **2025-10**: October 2025
- **2025-11**: November 2025
- **2025-12**: December 2025

## Analysis

### Pattern Recognition
1. **August Months**: Multiple August months are missing (2017, 2018, 2019, 2020)
2. **May Months**: Several May months are missing (2017, 2018, 2019, 2021, 2022)
3. **February 2020**: Only February missing from 2020
4. **May 2016**: Confirmed exists but missing from pipeline
5. **Future Data**: 2025 comments missing (threads exist but comments don't)

### Potential Causes
1. **Seasonal Patterns**: August and May might have different posting patterns
2. **Reddit API Issues**: Historical data might have been affected by API changes
3. **Fetch Failures**: Some months might have failed during fetch operations
4. **Data Processing Issues**: Comments might have been lost during processing
5. **Date Range Assumptions**: Pipeline might have assumed June 2016 start

## Recommendations

### Priority 1: Critical Missing Data
1. **Fetch May 2016**: Highest priority - confirmed data exists
2. **Investigate Historical Gaps**: Check if August and May months have different thread patterns
3. **Manual Verification**: Use curl/Reddit search to verify if threads exist for missing months
4. **Fetch Missing Months**: Attempt to fetch the 10 completely missing months
5. **Document Patterns**: Create patterns for handling seasonal variations

### Priority 2: Comment Data Recovery
1. **Re-fetch Comments**: For months with threads but missing comments
2. **Investigate Processing**: Check if comment processing failed for these months
3. **Future Data**: Set up monitoring for 2025 comment fetching

### Priority 3: Prevention
1. **Monitoring**: Set up alerts for missing months
2. **Validation**: Add checks to ensure both threads and comments are present
3. **Documentation**: Update fetch procedures to handle edge cases
4. **Date Range**: Update pipeline to start from May 2016, not June 2016

## Next Steps
1. **Immediate**: Fetch May 2016 (confirmed data exists)
2. Test fetch for one missing month (e.g., 2020-02) to see if it's a systematic issue
3. Investigate the August/May pattern to understand if it's a Reddit posting pattern
4. Create a comprehensive fetch plan for all missing months
5. Set up automated monitoring for future data completeness

## Files Affected
- `data/threads/` - Missing 10 files (including confirmed 2016-05)
- `data/comments/` - Missing 17 files
- Pipeline phases: extract, match, enrich, aggregate, report (all affected by missing data)
