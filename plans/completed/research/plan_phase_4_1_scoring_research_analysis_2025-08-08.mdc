# Phase 4.1: Scoring Research and Analysis Plan

**Date**: 2025-08-08  
**Status**: RESEARCH PLAN (NON-TDD APPROACH)  
**Type**: Data Analysis and Research Plan
**Parent Plan**: `@plan_multi_strategy_scoring_system_tdd_implementation_2025-08-04.mdc`

## üìò Project Summary

Conduct comprehensive research and analysis of the current brush matching system to identify quality indicators, match distribution patterns, and define metrics for intelligent scoring hierarchy optimization. This research phase will provide the data-driven foundation for implementing quality-based scoring improvements in subsequent phases.

**Scope**: Research and analysis only - no product changes. Focus on understanding current state and defining quality metrics for future scoring enhancements.

## üìã Current Context

**Parent Phase**: Phase 4: Intelligent Scoring Hierarchy Optimization  
**Current Status**: Phase 3 (Alignment) completed with 100% agreement between legacy and scoring systems  
**Next Phase**: Phase 4.1 research will inform Phase 4.2+ implementation phases

**Problem Statement**: Current scoring system treats all matches of the same type equally, but some matches are inherently higher quality or more specific than others. A "known" catalog match should score higher than an "other" fallback match, and manufacturer-specific strategies should score higher than generic artisan strategies.
