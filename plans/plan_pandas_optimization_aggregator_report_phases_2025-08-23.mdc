# Pandas Optimization Plan for Aggregator and Report Phases

## üìò Project Summary
This plan addresses the optimization of Python loops in the SOTD Pipeline's aggregator and report phases by replacing them with pandas vectorized operations. The goal is to improve performance, maintainability, and code consistency across these critical data processing components.

## üß© Component Steps

### Phase 0: Baseline Creation ‚úÖ COMPLETE
0. **Create Performance Baseline** - Run pipeline (match through report) for 2025-06 and 2025-07 to create baseline files for comparison ‚úÖ
0.5. **Baseline Metadata Analysis** - Analyze baseline files to identify metadata fields to ignore during comparison ‚úÖ

**Baseline Validation Results:**
- **Reports**: ‚úÖ Identical (hardware and software reports match baseline exactly)
- **Aggregated Data**: ‚ùå Different (sample_brands: baseline=0, current=20)
- **Root Cause**: **CRITICAL BUG DISCOVERY** - Baseline had incorrect sample_brands=0, should have been 20
- **Validation**: Script confirms 20 unique sample brands in 2025-06 data (27 total samples, 20 unique brands)
- **Decision**: Keep corrected function - baseline was wrong, our output is correct
- **Impact**: Reports are identical, so user-facing output is unchanged
- **Function Behavior**: calculate_sample_brands correctly counts unique brands, not total sample records

### Phase 1: File Discovery and Analysis ‚úÖ COMPLETE
1. **Aggregator Core Files Review** - Review main aggregator files for Python loops ‚úÖ
2. **Aggregator Strategy Files Review** - Review specialized aggregator strategy files ‚úÖ
3. **Report Core Files Review** - Review main report generation files ‚úÖ
4. **Report Utility Files Review** - Review report utility and helper files ‚úÖ
5. **Aggregator Utility Files Review** - Review aggregator utility files ‚úÖ

**Implementation Notes:**
- **Critical Bug Fix**: Resolved NoneType.strip() errors that were causing aggregate phase failures
- **Terminology Update**: Updated all references from deprecated 'maker' terminology to 'brand' consistently
- **Sample Brands Fix**: Corrected calculate_sample_brands function to properly check sample_type field
- **Pandas Optimization**: Implemented pandas-optimized metrics calculations for better performance
- **Test Coverage**: Added comprehensive tests for all metrics functions (41 tests passing)
- **Output Difference**: Current output differs from baseline due to bug fixes (sample_brands: 0 ‚Üí 20)

### Phase 2: Implementation and Optimization
6. **Core Aggregator Optimization** - Optimize base aggregator and annual aggregator
7. **Baseline Validation #1** - Verify core aggregator optimizations don't change output
8. **Specialized Aggregator Optimization** - Optimize brush, razor, and user aggregators
9. **Baseline Validation #2** - Verify specialized aggregator optimizations don't change output
10. **Report Generation Optimization** - Optimize table generators and report core
11. **Baseline Validation #3** - Verify report generation optimizations don't change output
12. **Utility Function Optimization** - Optimize utility functions and helpers
13. **Baseline Validation #4** - Verify utility function optimizations don't change output
14. **Integration Testing** - Verify all optimizations work correctly together

## üîÅ Implementation Prompts

### Step 0: Create Performance Baseline
```text
Create a baseline for performance comparison by running the pipeline (match through report) for 2025-06 and 2025-07:

Baseline creation steps:
1. **Create baseline directory**: Create `.ab_backups/baseline_pandas_optimization/` directory
2. **Run match phase**: Execute `python run.py match --month 2025-06 --force` and `python run.py match --month 2025-07 --force`
3. **Run enrich phase**: Execute `python run.py enrich --month 2025-06 --force` and `python run.py enrich --month 2025-07 --force`
4. **Run aggregate phase**: Execute `python run.py aggregate --month 2025-06 --force` and `python run.py aggregate --month 2025-07 --force`
5. **Run report phase**: Execute `python run.py report --month 2025-06 --force` and `python run.py report --month 2025-07 --force`
6. **Copy baseline files**: Copy all generated files to baseline directory:
   - `data/matched/2025-06.json` ‚Üí `.ab_backups/baseline_pandas_optimization/matched/2025-06.json`
   - `data/matched/2025-07.json` ‚Üí `.ab_backups/baseline_pandas_optimization/matched/2025-07.json`
   - `data/enriched/2025-06.json` ‚Üí `.ab_backups/baseline_pandas_optimization/enriched/2025-06.json`
   - `data/enriched/2025-07.json` ‚Üí `.ab_backups/baseline_pandas_optimization/enriched/2025-07.json`
   - `data/aggregated/2025-06.json` ‚Üí `.ab_backups/baseline_pandas_optimization/aggregated/2025-06.json`
   - `data/aggregated/2025-07.json` ‚Üí `.ab_backups/baseline_pandas_optimization/aggregated/2025-07.json`
   - `data/reports/2025-06-hardware.md` ‚Üí `.ab_backups/baseline_pandas_optimization/reports/2025-06-hardware.md`
   - `data/reports/2025-06-software.md` ‚Üí `.ab_backups/baseline_pandas_optimization/reports/2025-06-software.md`
   - `data/reports/2025-07-hardware.md` ‚Üí `.ab_backups/baseline_pandas_optimization/reports/2025-07-hardware.md`
   - `data/reports/2025-07-software.md` ‚Üí `.ab_backups/baseline_pandas_optimization/reports/2025-07-software.md`

Baseline purpose:
- **Performance comparison**: Measure execution time before optimizations
- **Output validation**: Ensure pandas optimizations don't change actual data
- **Regression prevention**: Catch any unintended changes in output
- **Metadata tracking**: Note timestamps and processing details for comparison

**IMPORTANT**: This baseline will be used to verify that our pandas optimizations only improve performance without changing the actual output data (excluding metadata timestamps, etc.).

### Step 0.5: Baseline Metadata Analysis
```text
After creating the baseline files, analyze each file type to identify metadata fields that should be ignored during comparison:

Analysis steps:
1. **Examine baseline file structures** to identify metadata fields
2. **Document which fields to ignore** for each file type
3. **Update comparison scripts** with the correct ignore patterns
4. **Validate comparison methodology** works correctly

## üìã Baseline File Analysis Results

### **JSON Files (Matched, Enriched, Aggregated Data)**
**Structure**: 
- **Root level**: Contains `meta` and `data` sections
- **Meta section**: Contains processing statistics and counts
- **Data section**: Contains the actual product data and rankings

**Metadata fields to IGNORE during comparison**:
- **NONE** - All fields in JSON files are data content, not processing metadata
- **Note**: The `meta` section contains actual data statistics (total_shaves, unique_shavers, etc.)
- **These are NOT processing timestamps** - they are calculated data that must remain identical

**Fields that MUST be identical**:
- All fields in `meta` section (total_shaves, unique_shavers, unique_soaps, etc.)
- All fields in `data` section (rankings, counts, user counts, etc.)
- JSON structure and field names
- Product order and ranking

### **Markdown Files (Reports)**
**Structure**:
- **Header**: Report title and summary statistics
- **Tables**: Product rankings with delta columns
- **No processing timestamps** found in current reports

**Content that MUST be identical**:
- All table data and rankings
- All statistics and counts
- All delta calculations (Œî vs previous months)
- Markdown formatting and structure
- Product names and descriptions

**Content that may differ** (acceptable):
- **NONE** - All content must be identical

## üìù Key Findings

1. **JSON files have NO processing metadata to ignore** - all fields are data content
2. **Markdown reports have NO processing timestamps** - all content is data
3. **Comparison must be exact** - no fields can be ignored during validation
4. **Updated comparison scripts** reflect the actual file structure
5. **Validation is stricter** than originally planned - any difference indicates a problem

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- **No metadata filtering needed** for JSON files
- **No timestamp removal needed** for markdown files  
- **All content must be identical** between baseline and current output
- **Any difference indicates a regression** that must be investigated
- **Comparison is simpler** than originally planned - direct file comparison works

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### **Usage Instructions**
```bash
# After each optimization phase, run comparison:
python scripts/compare_baseline.py

# Or use individual diff commands:
diff -u .ab_backups/baseline_pandas_optimization/aggregated/2025-06.json data/aggregated/2025-06.json
```

## üìù Key Findings

1. **JSON files have NO processing metadata to ignore** - all fields are data content
2. **Markdown reports have NO processing timestamps** - all content is data
3. **Comparison must be exact** - no fields can be ignored during validation
4. **Updated comparison scripts** reflect the actual file structure
5. **Validation is stricter** than originally planned - any difference indicates a problem

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- **No metadata filtering needed** for JSON files
- **No timestamp removal needed** for markdown files  
- **All content must be identical** between baseline and current output
- **Any difference indicates a regression** that must be investigated
- **Comparison is simpler** than originally planned - direct file comparison works
```
