# Delta Columns Fix Investigation Plan

## Overview
Investigate and fix issues with delta columns in the SOTD Pipeline report generation system.

## Investigation Status: IN_PROGRESS üîç

### Root Cause Analysis: IN_PROGRESS üîç
- **Issue Identified**: Delta columns (Œî vs previous month, Œî vs previous year, Œî vs 5 years ago) are showing "n/a" for many tables
- **Current Status**: Path construction issues were fixed, but the core delta calculation problem remains unresolved
- **Evidence**: June 2025 report shows all delta columns as "n/a" for most tables (Christopher Bradley Plates, Game Changer Plates, Straight Widths, etc.)

### Path Construction Issues: FIXED ‚úÖ
- **Problem**: Report core was constructing paths like `data/aggregated/aggregated/2024-10.json` instead of `data/aggregated/2024-10.json`
- **Root Cause**: Report core was passing `data_root / "aggregated"` to functions that already add the "aggregated" subdirectory
- **Fix Applied**: Updated report core to pass just `data_root` instead of `data_root / "aggregated"` to path construction functions

### Method Call Issues: VERIFIED ‚úÖ
- **Status**: No method call issues found
- **Verification**: The `DeltaCalculator.calculate_deltas` method exists and is being called correctly
- **Method Signature**: `calculate_deltas(current_data, historical_data, name_key="name", max_items=20)`
- **Base Class Calls**: All calls use correct method signature and parameters

### Delta Column Functionality: NOT WORKING ‚ùå
- **Status**: Delta columns are NOT working correctly in generated reports
- **Problem**: All three delta columns show "n/a" for most table types
- **Evidence**: June 2025 report shows:
  - Christopher Bradley Plates: All delta columns = "n/a"
  - Game Changer Plates: All delta columns = "n/a"  
  - Straight Widths: All delta columns = "n/a"
  - Straight Grinds: All delta columns = "n/a"
  - Straight Points: All delta columns = "n/a"
  - Most Used Blades in Most Used Razors: All delta columns = "n/a"
  - Highest Use Count per Blade: All delta columns = "n/a"

### Test Results: ALL PASSING ‚úÖ
- **Total Tests**: 283
- **Status**: All tests passing
- **Path Tests**: Fixed and passing
- **Delta Calculator Tests**: All passing
- **Table Generator Tests**: All passing
- **Integration Tests**: All passing

## Implementation Summary

### Files Modified
1. **`sotd/report/report_core.py`** - Fixed path construction to avoid double "aggregated" subdirectory
2. **`sotd/report/load.py`** - Restored correct path structure (was incorrectly modified during initial fix)

### Key Changes Made
1. **Report Core Path Fix**: Changed `data_root / "aggregated"` to `data_root` in path construction calls
2. **Load Module Path Restoration**: Restored correct `data/aggregated/` path structure that was incorrectly removed

### Verification Steps Completed
1. ‚úÖ **Path Construction**: Fixed double "aggregated" subdirectory issue
2. ‚úÖ **Report Generation**: Successfully generates reports with correct data loading
3. ‚ùå **Delta Columns**: Delta columns are NOT working correctly - showing "n/a" for most tables
4. ‚úÖ **Test Suite**: All 283 tests passing
5. ‚úÖ **Integration**: Report generation works end-to-end with debug output

## Current Status: CORE ISSUE UNRESOLVED ‚ùå

The investigation has **NOT** resolved the main problem. While path construction issues were fixed, the delta columns are still showing "n/a" for most tables. This indicates that:

1. **Data is loading correctly** (no more path errors)
2. **Delta calculation infrastructure exists** (tests pass)
3. **But delta calculations are not producing results** (all showing "n/a")

## Next Steps: Continue Investigation üîç

### 1. Investigate Delta Calculation Logic (IMMEDIATE)
- Check why `DeltaCalculator.calculate_deltas` is returning empty results
- Verify that historical data is being passed correctly to delta calculations
- Debug the actual delta calculation process in table generation

### 2. Examine Data Flow in Table Generation
- Trace how comparison data flows from report core to table generators
- Verify that historical data is being extracted and passed correctly
- Check if table generators are calling delta calculations with proper parameters

### 3. Debug Delta Calculation Execution
- Add debug output to see what data is being passed to delta calculations
- Verify that historical data contains the expected structure
- Check if delta calculations are receiving the right data types and formats

### 4. Investigate Historical Data Loading
- Verify that comparison data loading is working correctly
- Check if historical data files exist and contain expected data
- Ensure that data structure matches what delta calculations expect

## Conclusion

The delta columns fix investigation is **NOT COMPLETE**. While path construction issues were resolved, the core problem of delta columns showing "n/a" remains unresolved. The investigation must continue to find why delta calculations are not producing results despite the infrastructure being in place and tests passing.

## Lessons Learned

1. **Path fixes ‚â† functional fixes**: Resolving path issues doesn't guarantee functional fixes
2. **Test passing ‚â† feature working**: All tests can pass while the actual feature fails
3. **Investigation depth**: Need to verify actual functionality, not just infrastructure
4. **Evidence-based debugging**: Use actual report output to verify fixes work

## Next Session

Continue investigation to find why delta calculations are returning "n/a" despite all infrastructure being in place and tests passing.
