# Delta Columns Fix Investigation Plan

## Overview
Investigate and fix issues with delta columns in the SOTD Pipeline report generation system.

## Investigation Status: COMPLETE ✅

### Root Cause Analysis: COMPLETE ✅
- **Issue Identified**: The plan incorrectly stated that the base class was calling a non-existent method `calculate_deltas` instead of `calculate_deltas_for_period`
- **Actual Finding**: The `DeltaCalculator` class DOES have a `calculate_deltas` method, and the calls in the base class are correct
- **Real Issue**: Path construction problems in the report core causing double "aggregated" subdirectory paths

### Path Construction Issues: FIXED ✅
- **Problem**: Report core was constructing paths like `data/aggregated/aggregated/2024-10.json` instead of `data/aggregated/2024-10.json`
- **Root Cause**: Report core was passing `data_root / "aggregated"` to functions that already add the "aggregated" subdirectory
- **Fix Applied**: Updated report core to pass just `data_root` instead of `data_root / "aggregated"` to path construction functions

### Method Call Issues: VERIFIED ✅
- **Status**: No method call issues found
- **Verification**: The `DeltaCalculator.calculate_deltas` method exists and is being called correctly
- **Method Signature**: `calculate_deltas(current_data, historical_data, name_key="name", max_items=20)`
- **Base Class Calls**: All calls use correct method signature and parameters

### Delta Column Functionality: VERIFIED ✅
- **Status**: Delta columns are working correctly in generated reports
- **Columns Present**: All three delta columns are generated:
  - Δ vs previous month
  - Δ vs previous year  
  - Δ vs 5 years ago
- **Delta Indicators**: Working correctly (↑, ↓, =, n/a)
- **Test Coverage**: All 283 report tests passing

### Test Results: ALL PASSING ✅
- **Total Tests**: 283
- **Status**: All tests passing
- **Path Tests**: Fixed and passing
- **Delta Calculator Tests**: All passing
- **Table Generator Tests**: All passing
- **Integration Tests**: All passing

## Implementation Summary

### Files Modified
1. **`sotd/report/report_core.py`** - Fixed path construction to avoid double "aggregated" subdirectory
2. **`sotd/report/load.py`** - Restored correct path structure (was incorrectly modified during initial fix)

### Key Changes Made
1. **Report Core Path Fix**: Changed `data_root / "aggregated"` to `data_root` in path construction calls
2. **Load Module Path Restoration**: Restored correct `data/aggregated/` path structure that was incorrectly removed

### Verification Steps Completed
1. ✅ **Path Construction**: Fixed double "aggregated" subdirectory issue
2. ✅ **Report Generation**: Successfully generates reports with correct data loading
3. ✅ **Delta Columns**: All three delta columns working correctly in generated reports
4. ✅ **Test Suite**: All 283 tests passing
5. ✅ **Integration**: Report generation works end-to-end with debug output

## Conclusion

The delta columns fix investigation is **COMPLETE**. The original issue was incorrectly diagnosed as a method call problem, but the real issue was path construction problems in the report core. After fixing the path construction issues:

- ✅ Delta columns are working correctly
- ✅ All tests are passing  
- ✅ Report generation is working end-to-end
- ✅ Path construction is correct and consistent

The system is now fully functional with proper delta column generation and all tests passing.

## Lessons Learned

1. **Investigation Accuracy**: Always verify the actual code before accepting reported issues
2. **Path Construction**: Be careful with path construction to avoid double subdirectory issues
3. **Test Validation**: Use comprehensive testing to verify fixes work end-to-end
4. **Method Verification**: Check actual method existence before assuming method call issues

## Next Steps

No further action required. The delta columns fix investigation is complete and all issues have been resolved.
