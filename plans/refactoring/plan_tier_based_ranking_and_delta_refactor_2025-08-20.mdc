# Tier-Based Ranking and Delta System Refactor Plan

**Date**: 2025-08-20  
**Status**: PLANNING  
**Type**: Refactoring - Aggregator Ranking and Delta System Enhancement

## 📘 Project Summary

Refactor the SOTD Pipeline aggregator system to implement tier-based ranking instead of sequential positions, enabling accurate delta calculations and improved user experience. The current system assigns sequential positions (1, 2, 3, 4) even when items have identical ranking values, leading to misleading delta calculations. This refactor will implement proper tie detection, tier-based ranking, and enhanced report table displays.

## 🧠 Critical Analysis

### Plan Structure Assessment
The plan follows a logical progression from core functionality (ranking system) to integration (delta calculations) to presentation (table displays) to validation (testing and performance). Each phase builds upon the previous one, ensuring no orphaned code.

### Risk Mitigation
- **Breaking Changes**: The transition from "position" to "rank" field requires careful migration across all components
- **Performance**: Tier-based ranking introduces complexity that could impact performance; comprehensive testing required
- **Data Consistency**: Ensuring consistent ranking logic across all aggregator types is critical

### Implementation Strategy
- **Incremental Approach**: Each phase is self-contained and can be implemented independently
- **Test-First Development**: Comprehensive test coverage for each phase ensures quality
- **Backward Compatibility**: While this is a breaking change, the modular approach allows for controlled migration

### Dependencies and Order
- Phase 1 (Core Ranking) must complete before Phase 2 (Delta Updates)
- Phase 2 (Delta Updates) must complete before Phase 3 (Table Integration)
- Phase 4 (Testing) can run in parallel with other phases but must complete before production deployment

### Success Metrics
- All tests passing (unit, integration, end-to-end)
- Performance within acceptable limits

## ✅ Phase 1.1 Completion Summary

**Date Completed**: 2025-08-20  
**Status**: COMPLETED  
**Implementation**: BaseAggregator tier-based ranking system

### What Was Implemented
- ✅ **Added `tie_columns` property** with default `["shaves", "unique_users"]`
- ✅ **Implemented tier-based ranking logic** using optimized pandas groupby approach
- ✅ **Changed field name** from "position" to "rank" throughout the system
- ✅ **Updated aggregator architecture** to return clean numeric ranks (1, 2, 2, 3)
- ✅ **Added comprehensive test coverage** for all new functionality (16 tests passing)

### Technical Achievement
The tier-based ranking system correctly identifies when items have identical values across the `tie_columns` and assigns them the same rank. For example:
- Items with identical shaves + unique_users get the same rank
- Custom tie columns work (e.g., only shaves matter for ties)
- Sequential ranking works when no ties exist
- All existing functionality preserved

### Architecture Decision (UPDATED DURING IMPLEMENTATION)
- **Aggregators**: Handle ranking logic, return **numeric ranks only** (1, 2, 2, 3)
- **Table Generators**: Will handle display formatting ("2=" for ties) - Phase 1.2  
- **Clean separation of concerns** between data processing and presentation
- **Key Change**: Originally planned to have aggregators return formatted strings, but decided during implementation to keep aggregators focused on ranking logic and defer formatting to presentation layer

### Test Results
- **16/16 tests passing** ✅
- **Comprehensive coverage** of edge cases (no ties, all tied, custom tie columns)
- **TDD approach followed** - wrote failing tests first, then implemented code

### Implementation Lessons Learned
1. **Pandas groupby approach discovered**: Initially implemented custom iteration logic, but discovered a much more efficient pandas-native approach using `groupby().ngroup()` for multi-column tie detection.

2. **Architecture evolution**: Originally planned to have aggregators return formatted strings ("2="), but during implementation realized this violates separation of concerns. Moved formatting to table generators.

3. **Test data importance**: Initial test failures were due to incorrect test data (items with different shave counts being expected to tie). Careful test data construction is critical for tie detection testing.

4. **TDD effectiveness**: Writing failing tests first caught the architectural issues early and guided us to the cleaner solution.

5. **Field name consistency**: Changing from "position" to "rank" required updating all related tests, confirming this is indeed a breaking change that will need careful migration.

6. **Performance optimization**: The pandas groupby approach is significantly more efficient than custom Python loops and leverages pandas' optimized C-level operations.

### Next Steps
Ready to proceed with Phase 2.1: Update DeltaCalculator for tier-based ranking.

- ✅ **Integrated rank formatting** into `generate_table()` method for automatic rank column display
- ✅ **Created comprehensive test suite** with 8 unit tests covering all tie scenarios and edge cases

### Technical Achievement
The table generator system now automatically displays formatted ranks with tie indicators (e.g., "2=" for tied items) while maintaining clean separation of concerns:
- **Aggregators**: Return numeric ranks (1, 2, 2, 3)
- **Table Generators**: Format ranks with tie indicators ("1", "2=", "2=", "3")
- **Automatic Integration**: Rank column appears automatically in all product tables
- **Consistent Formatting**: Tie indicators work for 2-way, 3-way, and mixed tie patterns
