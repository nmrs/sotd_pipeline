# Phase 7+ Intelligent Scoring Implementation Plan

**Date**: 2025-08-09 (Deferred from Phase 4.2+)  
**Status**: DEFERRED - Awaiting User Validation Data  
**Type**: Data-Driven TDD Implementation (Future)
**Parent Plan**: `@plan_multi_strategy_scoring_system_tdd_implementation_2025-08-04.mdc`
**Research Foundation**: Phase 4.1 Steps 1-6 analysis results

## 📘 Project Summary

**DEFERRED IMPLEMENTATION**: This plan was originally Phase 4.2+ but has been deferred to Phase 7+ to ensure quality metrics are based on real user feedback data rather than assumptions.

**Dependencies**: Requires completion of:
- Phase 4: Brush User Validation System (WebUI validation tools)
- Phase 5: Brush Learning System (ChatGPT integration, user feedback collection)
- Phase 6: Testing and Validation

**Future Implementation**: Will implement intelligent scoring hierarchy optimization based on comprehensive Phase 4.1 research findings PLUS real user validation data. The system will transition from treating all matches equally to a quality-based scoring system that reflects actual user preferences and validation patterns.

**Research Foundation**: 
- 70.3% current success rate → Target 85%+ success rate
- 0% catalog coverage → Target 60%+ coverage  
- 152 manual corrections → Target <50 patterns
- 5-tier quality hierarchy with concrete scoring formulas

## 📋 Research Summary and Implementation Goals

2. **Quality Gaps**: 0% complete catalog entries, 91.2% minimal entries  
3. **Coverage Issues**: 66 high-volume brands missing from catalog
4. **User Feedback**: 152 corrections with clear quality preferences
5. **Validation Infrastructure**: 11 WebUI tools + analysis framework ready

### Quality Metrics Defined
