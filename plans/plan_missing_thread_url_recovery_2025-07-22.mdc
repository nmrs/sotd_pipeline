# Plan: Missing SOTD Thread URL Recovery
# Date: 2025-07-22
# Status: RESTARTING

## Project Summary
This plan documents the process for researching and recovering missing Reddit SOTD thread URLs for days identified as missing in the SOTD pipeline's `data/comments/` folder. The goal is to improve data completeness by finding and adding thread URLs to `thread_overrides.yaml` for dates with missing threads.

## Implementation Strategy: Cache-First Approach

### Phase 1: Cache Analysis (Primary Strategy)
1. âœ… **COMPLETE**: Analyze `data/comments/` metadata to identify missing thread dates
   - **Results**: Found 58 total missing dates (now 49 after filtering future dates)
   - **Coverage**: 2016-05 through 2025-06 (9+ years of data)
   - **Method**: Cross-reference expected daily threads vs actual fetched threads
2. âœ… **COMPLETE**: Search cache validation results for missing thread URLs
   - **Cache search success rate**: 48.3% (28/58 dates found in cache)
   - **Search method**: Date-based pattern matching against cached thread data
   - **Validation criteria**: Thread title relevance, date accuracy, engagement levels
3. âœ… **COMPLETE**: Validate found cache threads against missing dates
   - **Found threads**: 28 threads identified in cache
   - **Validation success rate**: 85.7% (24/28 threads validated)
   - **Rejection reasons**: Wrong dates, non-SOTD threads, low engagement
4. âœ… **COMPLETE**: Extract best matches from validation results
   - **Best matches extracted**: 24 valid threads from cache
   - **Total threads checked**: 28 threads from cache search
   - **Quality criteria**: Exact date matches, proper SOTD content, good engagement
5. âœ… **COMPLETE**: Update `thread_overrides.yaml` with validated cache results
   - **Total overrides**: 50 entries (24 cache + 26 existing)
   - **Final recovery rate**: 49.0% (24/49 dates recovered from cache)
   - **Remaining missing**: 25 dates requiring external search
6. âœ… **COMPLETE**: Calculate cache analysis recovery success rate
   - **Cache analysis success**: 49.0% recovery rate
   - **Cache analysis efficiency**: High (automated, comprehensive)
   - **Cache analysis quality**: Good (validated threads, proper metadata)
7. âœ… **COMPLETE**: Document cache search process and results for each missing date
   - **Documentation**: Complete cache search methodology
   - **Results tracking**: All cache findings documented
   - **Quality metrics**: Success rates and validation criteria documented

### Phase 2: External Search (Secondary Strategy - Only if Needed)
8. âœ… **INITIATED**: For remaining missing dates after cache analysis, execute external searches:
   - **Standard Reddit search patterns**: flair:SOTD, date-based searches
   - **Alternative title formats**: "SOTD Thread", "Shave of the Day", "Daily SOTD", etc.
   - **Date format variations**: MM/DD, MM-DD, DD/MM, ISO formats
   - **Broader searches**: Without flair restrictions, by author, by time period
   - **External resources**: Djudge Portal, DamnFineShave, other wetshaving forums
   - **Archive searches**: Wayback Machine, Reddit archives, Google site searches
   - **Cross-reference validation**: Check if threads exist with different titles or flairs
   - **Results**: Generated search patterns for 20 missing dates (reduced from 25)
   - **Major discovery**: 5 July 2025 threads found in updated fetch results
   - **Search strategies documented**: Reddit search, Wayback Machine, external resources
   - **Files created**: external_search_results.json, external_search_summary.md
9. ðŸ”„ **TODO**: Validate found external threads by checking:
   - Thread title relevance to SOTD
   - Comment activity levels and patterns
   - Date accuracy and context
   - Thread content and community engagement
   - **Record ALL findings**: Include both valid and rejected threads with reasons
10. ðŸ”„ **TODO**: Record all external-found URLs with metadata (date, source, validation status, rejection reasons if applicable)
11. ðŸ”„ **TODO**: Update `thread_overrides.yaml` with validated external search results
12. ðŸ”„ **TODO**: Calculate external search recovery success rate

### Phase 3: Validation and Integration
13. ðŸ”„ **TODO**: Validate all found threads (cache + external) by checking:
   - Thread title relevance
   - Comment activity levels
   - Date accuracy
   - Thread content quality
   - **Record ALL findings**: Include both valid and rejected threads with detailed rejection reasons
14. ðŸ”„ **TODO**: Prepare final thread_overrides.yaml updates
15. ðŸ”„ **TODO**: Test pipeline with updated overrides to verify recovery
16. ðŸ”„ **TODO**: Document search process and results for each missing date

### Phase 4: Documentation and Analysis
17. ðŸ”„ **TODO**: Calculate overall recovery success rate and statistics
18. ðŸ”„ **TODO**: Document lessons learned and search strategy effectiveness
19. ðŸ”„ **TODO**: Provide recommendations for future missing thread recovery
20. ðŸ”„ **TODO**: Update pipeline search patterns based on discoveries

## Cache-First Search Strategy

### Cache Analysis Priority Order
1. **Direct Date Match**: Search for exact date in cache files
2. **Date Variation Search**: Look for threads posted day before/after missing date
3. **Title Pattern Search**: Search for SOTD thread title patterns in cache
4. **Comment Activity Analysis**: Identify threads with comments on missing dates
5. **Author Pattern Search**: Look for both AutoModerator and human-posted threads

### Cache Validation Criteria
- **Thread Relevance**: Must be a genuine SOTD thread
- **Comment Activity**: Should have substantial community engagement
- **Date Accuracy**: Thread date should match missing date (or be adjacent)
- **Title Consistency**: Should follow SOTD thread naming patterns
- **Content Quality**: Thread should contain SOTD-related content and community discussion

### Cache File Structure Analysis
- **Threads Cache Location**: `/Users/jmoore/Documents/Projects/sotd-report/cache/threads/`
- **Comments Cache Location**: `/Users/jmoore/Documents/Projects/sotd-report/cache/comments/`
- **Threads Cache Format**: JSON files by year/month (e.g., `202205.json`)
- **Comments Cache Format**: JSON files by year/month (e.g., `202205.json`)
- **Threads Cache Content**: Thread metadata and basic thread information
- **Comments Cache Content**: Comment data with thread references and activity
- **Coverage**: Complete thread history with comment activity from both sources

## Documentation Format for Found Threads

### When documenting found threads, include:
- **Date**: YYYY-MM-DD format
- **URL**: Complete Reddit thread URL
- **Title**: Thread title for context
- **Author**: AutoModerator or human username (for reference only)
- **Comment Count**: Number of comments for validation
- **Source**: Cache file or external search method
- **Validation Status**: Valid SOTD thread, Rejected, or Under Review
- **Rejection Reasons**: Detailed explanation if thread was rejected

### Example Documentation Format:
```
2022-05-01: 
  URL: "https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/ufshnb/sunday_sotd_thread_may_01_2022/"
  Title: "Sunday SOTD Thread - May 01, 2022"
  Author: AutoModerator
  Comments: 47
  Source: Cache file 202205.json
  Status: Valid SOTD thread

2022-05-08:
  URL: "https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/example/random_thread/"
  Title: "Random Discussion Thread"
  Author: HumanUser
  Comments: 12
  Source: Cache file 202205.json
  Status: Rejected
  Rejection Reasons: 
    - Thread title not SOTD-related
    - Low comment activity (12 comments)
    - Content focused on general discussion, not shaving
```

### Historical Record Requirements
- **Record ALL threads found**: Valid, rejected, and under review
- **Include rejection reasons**: Detailed explanation for why threads were rejected
- **Document search process**: What search strategies were used for each date
- **Track validation decisions**: Maintain audit trail of all validation choices
- **Note edge cases**: Document unusual or borderline cases for future reference

### Previous Remaining Missing Dates (8)
- **2016-05-01, 2016-05-02**: Early community days, likely no threads
- **2016-08-01**: Early community days, likely no threads
- **2018-11-01**: Likely genuinely missing
- **2021-01-23, 2021-01-24**: Likely genuinely missing
- **2021-09-01**: Likely genuinely missing
- **2022-05-08, 2022-05-12**: No dedicated threads existed

### Previous Key Insights
1. **Cache files are the gold standard**: More complete data than pipeline results
2. **Comments cache provides accurate picture**: Shows actual thread activity
3. **Three types of missing threads**:
   - Pipeline misses with comment activity
   - Pipeline misses without comment activity
   - Truly missing threads
4. **Pattern recognition**: Missing threads often cluster in specific time periods
5. **Mixed authorship**: Both AutoModerator and human users post valid SOTD threads
6. **Title/date format variations**: Human posts use different formats than AutoModerator

## Current Status
- **Plan Status**: Phase 1 Complete, Phase 2 Initiated
- **Current Success Rate**: 59.2% (29/49 dates recovered from cache)
- **Remaining Challenge**: 20 genuinely missing dates requiring external search
- **Primary Focus**: Manual external searches for 20 cache-missed dates
- **Secondary Focus**: Validation and documentation of external search results
- **Major Discovery**: 5 July 2025 threads found in updated fetch results

## Success Criteria
- [x] Complete systematic cache analysis of all missing dates
- [x] Achieve cache recovery rate of 49.0% (24/49 dates)
- [ ] Use external searches for remaining 25 cache-missed dates
- [x] Validate all found threads before adding to overrides
- [x] Document comprehensive cache search strategies with URLs
- [ ] Provide actionable recommendations for pipeline improvements
- [x] Maintain complete historical record of all findings (valid and rejected)

## Implementation Priority
1. **Cache Analysis First**: Exhaust all cache search possibilities
2. **Save Cache Results**: Update `thread_overrides.yaml` with cache findings
3. **External Search Only if Needed**: Only search externally for dates not found in cache
4. **Validate Everything**: Ensure all threads meet quality criteria
5. **Document URLs**: Always include the actual Reddit URLs when documenting found threads
6. **Record Rejections**: Document all rejected threads with detailed reasons for historical record
