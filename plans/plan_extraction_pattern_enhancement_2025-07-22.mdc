# Extraction Pattern Enhancement - TDD Implementation Plan

## üìò Project Summary

Enhance the SOTD Pipeline extraction phase to support additional product mention formats that were identified through analysis of 10+ years of skipped comments. This will capture an additional 196 high-quality extractions (28 checkmark format + 168 emoji bold format) while maintaining data quality through clear field identification.

**Key Requirements:**
- Add support for checkmark format: `‚úìField: Value`
- Add support for emoji bold format: `* **Field** Value`
- Maintain existing extraction quality and field identification
- Ensure backward compatibility with current patterns
- Comprehensive test coverage for new patterns

**Analysis Results:**
- **Checkmark Format**: 28 occurrences, 80% field identification success
- **Emoji Bold Format**: 168 occurrences, 75% field identification success
- **Total Potential Gain**: 196 additional extractions (2.3% of skipped comments)
- **High Confidence**: Both patterns have clear field identification

## üîÅ Implementation Prompts

### Step 1: Pattern Specification

```text
Define the exact regex patterns for the two new extraction formats identified in the analysis.

Requirements:
1. Checkmark Format: `‚úìField: Value` or `‚úì Field: Value`
   - Must match: `‚úìBrush: Kent Infinity`, `‚úìRazor: Kopparkant +`
   - Must handle optional space after checkmark
   - Must capture field name and value separately

2. Emoji Bold Format: `* **Field** Value`
   - Must match: `* **Straight Razor** - Fontani Scarperia`, `* **Shaving Brush** - Leonidam`
   - Must handle field names with spaces: `* **Shaving Soap** - Brand`
   - Must capture field name and value separately

3. Field Mapping:
   - Checkmark: Extract field name before colon, map to standard fields
   - Emoji Bold: Extract field name between `**`, map to standard fields
   - Map variations: "Lather" ‚Üí "soap", "Straight Razor" ‚Üí "razor", "Shaving Brush" ‚Üí "brush"

Write comprehensive unit tests for these patterns including:
- Valid checkmark format variations
- Valid emoji bold format variations
- Invalid formats that should not match
- Edge cases (extra spaces, special characters)
- Field mapping validation
```

### Step 2: Field Mapping Logic

```text
Enhance the field identification logic to handle the new patterns.

Requirements:
1. Update `identify_field()` function in extraction logic to handle:
   - Checkmark format field extraction
   - Emoji bold format field extraction
   - Field name normalization and mapping

2. Field Mapping Rules:
   - "Brush" ‚Üí "brush"
   - "Razor" ‚Üí "razor"

   - "Lather" ‚Üí "soap"
   - "Straight Razor" ‚Üí "razor"
   - "Shaving Brush" ‚Üí "brush"
   - "Shaving Soap" ‚Üí "soap"
   - Skip non-core fields: "Prep", "Post", "After-Shave"

3. Validation:
   - Only extract core fields: razor, blade, brush, soap

   - Maintain existing field identification accuracy

Write unit tests for field mapping including:
- All valid field mappings
- Invalid field rejection
