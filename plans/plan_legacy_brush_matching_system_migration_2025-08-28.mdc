# Legacy Brush Matching System Migration Plan

## Overview
This plan outlines the systematic migration from the legacy brush matching system to the new scoring-based system. The legacy system uses a "first match wins" approach, while the new system uses multi-strategy scoring with configurable weights and modifiers.

## Critical Success Criteria

### **MANDATORY**: Test Suite Must Be 100% Passing
- **ALL tests must pass before proceeding to any next step or phase**
- **Test failures indicate incomplete migration or architectural incompatibilities**
- **Running tests during migration helps catch issues early and prevents accumulation of problems**
- **Test failures are NOT just "config changes" - they reveal fundamental migration issues**

### **MANDATORY**: Quality Gates Between Phases
- **Phase completion requires:**
  1. All tests passing (100%)
  2. No linter errors
  3. No type check errors
  4. All quality checks passing (`make format lint typecheck test`)
- **No exceptions - failing tests block progression**

## Progress Summary

### âœ… **COMPLETED PHASES**

#### Phase 1: Extract Shared Functionality âœ…
- **Step 1**: Extract catalog loading logic to `CatalogLoader` âœ…
- **Step 2**: Extract strategy management logic to `StrategyManager` âœ…  
- **Step 3**: Extract configuration management logic to `ConfigManager` âœ…
- **Step 4**: Extract correct matches loading logic âœ…

#### Phase 2: Update New Scoring System âœ…
- **Step 5**: Update `BrushScoringMatcher` to use extracted components âœ…
- **Step 6**: Update wrapper strategies to remove legacy dependencies âœ…
- **Step 7**: Update `AutomatedSplitStrategy` to implement logic directly âœ…

#### Phase 3: Remove Legacy Components âœ…
- **Step 8**: Remove legacy classes (`BrushMatcher`, `BrushMatcherConfig`) âœ…
- **Step 9**: Remove legacy tools and directories âœ…

#### Phase 4: Test Migration and Validation âœ…
- **Step 10**: Restore critical test files to prevent massive coverage loss âœ…
- **Step 11**: Audit and triage all deleted test files âœ…

#### Phase 5: Test Validation and Updates âœ…
- **Step 12**: Verify restored tests can run without import errors âœ…
- **Step 13**: Update tests to work with current system interfaces âœ…
- **Step 14**: Run test suite to ensure no regressions âœ…

### ðŸ”„ **CURRENT PHASE**

#### Phase 6: Final Cleanup and Validation (IN PROGRESS)
- **Step 15**: Analyze and remove orphaned strategies (6 identified)
- **Step 16**: Rename `scoring_brush_matcher.py` to `brush_matcher.py`
- **Step 17**: Final validation and documentation

## Next Action

**IMMEDIATE PRIORITY**: **Step 15 - Analyze and remove orphaned strategies**

The critical test file restoration and cleanup work has been completed successfully:
- âœ… **32 critical test files restored** (preventing massive test coverage loss)
- âœ… **18 incorrectly restored legacy tests cleaned up** (they tested removed functionality)
- âœ… **Test suite now completely clean**: 931 tests passing, 0 errors, 0 broken tests
- âœ… **Match phase tests working**: 34 tests passing from 2 working test files

**Current Status**: Test suite is in excellent condition with all tests working correctly.

**Next Step**: Analyze and remove the 6 orphaned strategies that were only used by the legacy system. This involves:
1. Identifying which strategies are no longer needed
2. Verifying they're not used by the current system
3. Safely removing them to complete the legacy system cleanup

## Critical Success Metrics

### âœ… **ACHIEVED**
- **Test Coverage Preservation**: Prevented loss of 32 critical test files
- **Legacy System Removal**: Successfully removed all legacy brush matching components
- **New System Independence**: `BrushScoringMatcher` now works without legacy dependencies
- **Import Validation**: All restored test files can be imported without errors
- **Test Suite Cleanup**: Successfully identified and removed 18 incorrectly restored legacy tests
- **Clean Test Suite**: 931 tests passing, 0 errors, 0 broken tests
- **Match Phase Tests Working**: 34 tests passing from 2 working test files

### ðŸŽ¯ **TARGETS**
- **100% Test Pass Rate**: All tests continue to pass âœ… (ACHIEVED)
- **No Linter Errors**: Clean code quality across all tests âœ… (ACHIEVED)
- **No Type Check Errors**: Proper type safety maintained âœ… (ACHIEVED)
- **Full Test Coverage**: All critical functionality remains tested âœ… (ACHIEVED)
- **Complete Legacy Cleanup**: Remove orphaned strategies and finalize migration
- **System Renaming**: Rename `scoring_brush_matcher.py` to `brush_matcher.py`
