# Match Analyzer Group by Matched Feature

## üìò Project Summary
Add a "Group by Matched" toggle to MatchAnalyzer.tsx that groups soap match results by the matched string (brand + scent) instead of the original string. This will help identify which scent-specific regexes are most important to add to the catalog by showing the most common brand+scent combinations and the original patterns that lead to those matches.

**Key Requirements:**
- Toggle only appears when soap field is selected
- Groups by matched string (brand + scent) instead of original string
- Shows matched string, total count, and top 3 most common original patterns with individual counts
- Includes "+ n more" expandable list for all original patterns
- Includes brand, exact, and alias matches (excludes regex)
- Maintains existing functionality when toggle is off

- Fixed data table selection logic to handle both regular and grouped data types
- All tests passing with proper test isolation and specific assertions

## üîÅ Implementation Prompts

### Step 1: Add Group by Matched Toggle UI

```text
Add a "Group by Matched" toggle to MatchAnalyzer.tsx in the display mode section. The toggle should:

1. Only appear when selectedField === 'soap'
2. Be positioned alongside the existing display mode buttons
3. Have a clear label and tooltip explaining its purpose
4. Use consistent styling with existing UI components
5. Include proper state management with useState

Requirements:
- Toggle should be disabled when not on soap field
- Add proper TypeScript types for the new state
- Include accessibility attributes (aria-label, etc.)
- Use ShadCN UI components for consistency
- Position it logically in the display mode section

Test requirements:
- Unit test: Toggle visibility based on selectedField
- Unit test: Toggle state management
- Unit test: Proper disabled state when not on soap field
- Integration test: Toggle appears/disappears when switching fields
```

### Step 2: Implement Backend Grouping Logic

```text
Create a new API endpoint in webui/api/soap_analyzer.py for grouping soap matches by matched string:

1. Add new endpoint `/soap-analyzer/group-by-matched`
2. Accept months parameter and group_by_matched boolean
3. Group soap matches by matched string (brand + scent)
4. Aggregate original patterns with counts for each group
5. Return data in format suitable for frontend display

Requirements:
- Group by matched string: f"{brand} - {scent}"
- Include brand, exact, and alias matches only (exclude regex)
- Count occurrences of each original pattern per group
- Sort groups by total count (descending)
- Limit to top 3 original patterns per group initially
- Include total count of additional patterns for "+ n more" functionality

Test requirements:
- Unit test: Grouping logic with mock data
- Unit test: Filtering out regex matches
- Unit test: Counting original patterns correctly
- Integration test: Endpoint with real soap data
- Integration test: Verify data format matches frontend expectations
```

### Step 3: Update Frontend Data Processing

```text
Modify MatchAnalyzer.tsx to handle grouped data when the toggle is enabled:

1. Add new state for grouped data
2. Modify handleAnalyze to call different API endpoint when grouping is enabled
3. Update data processing logic to handle both grouped and ungrouped data
4. Ensure existing functionality works when toggle is off

Requirements:
- Conditional API call based on groupByMatched state
- Proper error handling for both data formats
- Maintain existing data structure when grouping is disabled
- Update loading states and error messages appropriately

Test requirements:
- Unit test: Conditional API call logic
- Unit test: Data processing for grouped vs ungrouped data
- Unit test: Error handling for both modes
- Integration test: Switching between grouped and ungrouped modes
- Integration test: Data display in both modes
```

### Step 4: Add Expandable Original Patterns Display

```text
Create an expandable component to display original patterns with counts:

1. Show top 3 original patterns with individual counts
2. Add "+ n more" button to expand and show all patterns
3. Implement smooth expand/collapse animation
4. Use consistent styling with existing UI components

Requirements:
- Display format: "Original Pattern (count)"
- Smooth expand/collapse with CSS transitions
- Proper keyboard navigation support
- Consistent with existing expandable components in the codebase
- Handle edge cases (no additional patterns, single pattern, etc.)

Test requirements:
- Unit test: Expand/collapse functionality
- Unit test: Display of pattern counts
- Unit test: Edge case handling
- Integration test: Expandable behavior in grouped data table
- Visual test: Smooth animations and proper styling
```

### Step 5: Integration Testing and Validation

```text
Comprehensive testing of the complete feature:

1. Test with real soap data from multiple months
2. Verify grouping accuracy and data integrity
3. Ensure existing functionality remains unchanged
4. Performance testing with large datasets
5. User experience validation

Requirements:
- Test with various soap match scenarios
- Verify correct grouping by brand+scent combinations
- Ensure original pattern counts are accurate
- Test expandable functionality with large datasets
- Validate that existing MatchAnalyzer features still work

Test requirements:
- E2E test: Complete workflow from field selection to data display

```

## üß† Critical Analysis

### Prompt Sequence and Structure
The plan follows a logical progression from UI to backend to integration, ensuring each step builds on the previous one. The prompts are sized appropriately - not too large to be overwhelming, but substantial enough to show meaningful progress.

### Key Design Decisions
1. **Backend-first approach**: Implementing the API endpoint before frontend changes ensures data integrity and proper separation of concerns
2. **Conditional visibility**: Only showing the toggle for soap field keeps the UI clean and focused
3. **Incremental testing**: Each step includes both unit and integration tests to catch issues early
4. **Maintainability**: Preserving existing functionality while adding new features

### Potential Risks and Mitigations
1. **Data format changes**: Risk of breaking existing functionality - mitigated by maintaining backward compatibility
2. **Performance impact**: Large datasets could slow down grouping - mitigated by efficient backend processing
3. **UI complexity**: Adding more controls could clutter the interface - mitigated by conditional visibility and clean design

### Success Criteria
- Toggle appears only when soap field is selected
- Grouping accurately shows brand+scent combinations with counts
- Original patterns display correctly with expandable functionality
- Existing MatchAnalyzer functionality remains unchanged
- Performance is acceptable with large datasets
- All tests pass and code quality standards are met

This plan provides a solid foundation for implementing the feature while maintaining code quality and ensuring comprehensive testing coverage.
