# Brush Matching Algorithm Priority Implementation Plan

## Action Items

- [x] ~~Align razor, blade, soap, and brush matching design for consistent return types, structure, and normalization logic across all matchers. This includes:~~
    - ~~Standardizing on a common MatchResult object or equivalent for all matchers~~
    - ~~Ensuring all matchers support both dict and attribute access for backward compatibility~~
    - ~~Unifying normalization and correct_matches logic~~
    - ~~Documenting the unified matcher interface and updating all relevant tests~~

## Completed Work

### Brush Matcher Refactor (COMPLETE)
- ✅ Refactored brush matcher to use typed `MatchResult` objects
- ✅ Updated all brush matching strategies to return `MatchResult` objects
- ✅ Removed redundant top-level fields (`handle_maker`, `knot_maker`) for handle/knot combos
- ✅ Updated all brush-related tests to expect new structure
- ✅ Fixed integration tests to handle both `MatchResult` objects and dictionaries
- ✅ Updated `match_record` function in `sotd/match/run.py` to handle both return types
- ✅ All 1513 tests now pass

### Integration Fix (COMPLETE)
- ✅ Fixed `match_record` function to handle both `MatchResult` objects (brush matcher) and dictionaries (other matchers)
- ✅ Added proper type checking with `isinstance(razor_result, MatchResult)`
- ✅ Updated integration tests to work with mixed return types
- ✅ Match phase now works correctly with updated matchers

## Current Status

**COMPLETE**: The brush matching refactor is fully complete and all tests pass. The match phase integration has been fixed to handle the transition period where brush matcher returns `MatchResult` objects while other matchers still return dictionaries.

## Notes
- This action item was added on 2025-07-14 as part of ongoing matcher refactoring and test alignment efforts.
- The integration fix was completed on 2025-07-14 to handle the transition period where brush matcher returns `MatchResult` objects while other matchers still return dictionaries.
- All 1513 tests now pass, confirming the refactor is stable and complete.
