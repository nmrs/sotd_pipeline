# Implementation Plan: Handles.yaml Model Support Restructuring (TDD)

**Date**: 2025-07-30  
**Status**: IN_PROGRESS  
**Priority**: HIGH  
**Scope**: handles.yaml restructuring, handle matchers, correct_matches.yaml compatibility

## üìò Project Summary

Restructure `handles.yaml` to support models similar to `knots.yaml`, enabling consistent brand/model separation for handles and improving the structure of `correct_matches.yaml` handle sections. This is a significant refactoring that requires updating handle matchers, correct matches manager, and YAML structure while maintaining all existing functionality.

## üß© Component Steps

### Phase 1: Analysis and Test Foundation
1. **Analyze current handles.yaml structure** - Identify specific models vs general patterns
2. **Create test baseline** - Comprehensive tests for current handle matching functionality
3. **Design new YAML structure** - Plan the brand/model hierarchy transformation

### Phase 2: Handle Matcher Updates (TDD)
4. **Update handle matcher interface** - Support brand/model hierarchy traversal
5. **Implement new matching logic** - Brand ‚Üí model ‚Üí patterns hierarchy
6. **Add comprehensive tests** - Test new structure with all existing patterns

### Phase 3: Correct Matches Manager Updates (TDD)
7. **Update CorrectMatchesManager** - Use catalog model names instead of extracted models
8. **Fix handle section structure** - Proper brand/model hierarchy in correct_matches.yaml
9. **Add integration tests** - Test correct matches saving/loading with new structure

### Phase 4: YAML Restructuring
10. **Restructure handles.yaml** - Transform to new brand/model hierarchy
11. **Validate structure** - Ensure all patterns work with new structure
12. **Update dependent code** - Fix any remaining integration issues

### Phase 5: Integration and Validation
13. **Comprehensive integration testing** - End-to-end validation
14. **Performance validation** - Ensure no regression in matching performance
15. **Documentation updates** - Update relevant documentation

## üîÅ Implementation Prompts

### Step 1: Analyze Current Handles.yaml Structure

```text
Analyze the current structure of data/handles.yaml to identify:

1. **Specific models mentioned in patterns** (like "washington", "jefferson", "jeffington" in Declaration Grooming)
2. **General brand patterns** that should go under "Unspecified" model
3. **Pattern organization** - which patterns belong to specific models vs general brand matching

Create a detailed mapping showing:
- Current brand ‚Üí patterns structure
- Proposed brand ‚Üí model ‚Üí patterns structure
- Specific models to extract (Washington, Jefferson, Jeffington, etc.)
- Patterns to keep under "Unspecified" for general brand matching

Focus on Declaration Grooming, Jayaruh, Dogwood Handcrafts, and any other brands with specific models mentioned in patterns.

Output: Detailed analysis with before/after structure mapping for each brand.
```

### Step 2: Create Test Baseline for Current Handle Matching

```text
Create comprehensive tests for current handle matching functionality to establish a baseline before refactoring.

Create tests in tests/match/test_handle_matcher_baseline.py that cover:

1. **Current pattern matching** - Test all existing patterns in handles.yaml work correctly
2. **Brand matching** - Test that brands are correctly identified
3. **Return structure** - Test current return format (brand, source_text, etc.)
4. **Edge cases** - Empty input, missing patterns, case sensitivity
5. **Integration with brush matchers** - Test handle matching within brush splitting

Use realistic test data that mirrors actual SOTD comments. Include tests for:
- Declaration Grooming patterns (washington, jefferson, jeffington, general declaration/dg)
- Jayaruh patterns
- Dogwood Handcrafts patterns
- Any other brands with specific model patterns

Ensure tests are comprehensive enough to catch any regressions during refactoring.
```

### Step 3: Design New YAML Structure

```text
Design the new handles.yaml structure based on the analysis from Step 1.

Create a new handles.yaml structure that:

1. **Follows knots.yaml pattern** - brand ‚Üí model ‚Üí patterns hierarchy
2. **Extracts specific models** - Washington, Jefferson, Jeffington for Declaration Grooming
3. **Uses "Unspecified" model** - For general brand patterns
4. **Maintains all existing patterns** - No pattern loss during restructuring

Show the complete new structure with:
- Declaration Grooming with Washington, Jefferson, Jeffington, and Unspecified models
- Jayaruh with Unspecified model
- Dogwood Handcrafts with Unspecified model
- Any other brands with specific models

Include validation that all existing patterns are preserved in the new structure.
```

### Step 4: Update Handle Matcher Interface (TDD)

```text
Update the handle matcher interface to support the new brand/model hierarchy structure.

First, write failing tests in tests/match/test_handle_matcher_new_structure.py that:

1. **Test brand/model hierarchy traversal** - brand ‚Üí model ‚Üí patterns
2. **Test specific model matching** - Washington, Jefferson, Jeffington patterns
3. **Test "Unspecified" model matching** - General brand patterns
4. **Test return structure** - Should include brand, model, source_text
5. **Test case-insensitive matching** - All matching should be case-insensitive

Then implement the minimal changes to make these tests pass:

1. **Update handle matcher to traverse brand/model hierarchy**
2. **Support model extraction** - Return both brand and model names
3. **Maintain existing pattern matching logic** - Just reorganize structure traversal
4. **Update return format** - Include model information in results

Focus on the interface changes without changing the YAML structure yet.
```

### Step 5: Implement New Matching Logic (TDD)

```text
Implement the new matching logic for brand/model hierarchy traversal.

Write additional tests in tests/match/test_handle_matcher_new_structure.py that cover:

1. **Complex pattern matching** - Multi-word brands, regex patterns
2. **Model priority** - Specific models should take precedence over "Unspecified"
3. **Pattern conflicts** - Handle overlapping patterns between specific models and general
4. **Performance** - Ensure no significant performance regression
5. **Error handling** - Invalid YAML structure, missing patterns

Implement the matching logic:

1. **Brand traversal** - Find matching brand first
2. **Model traversal** - Find matching model within brand
3. **Pattern matching** - Apply patterns within the selected model
4. **Fallback logic** - Use "Unspecified" model if no specific model matches
5. **Return format** - Include brand, model, source_text, match_type

Ensure all existing patterns continue to work with the new logic.
```

### Step 6: Add Comprehensive Tests for New Structure

```text
Add comprehensive tests for the new brand/model hierarchy structure.

Create tests in tests/match/test_handle_matcher_comprehensive.py that cover:

1. **All existing patterns** - Ensure every pattern from current handles.yaml still works
2. **New structure validation** - Test brand/model hierarchy traversal
3. **Specific model scenarios** - Washington, Jefferson, Jeffington matching
4. **General brand scenarios** - "Unspecified" model matching
5. **Edge cases** - Empty models, missing patterns, invalid structure
6. **Performance tests** - Benchmark matching performance
7. **Integration tests** - Test within brush splitting context

Include test data that mirrors real SOTD comments and covers all the patterns from the current handles.yaml.

Validate that the new structure maintains 100% compatibility with existing patterns while adding the new brand/model hierarchy.
```

### Step 7: Update CorrectMatchesManager (TDD)

```text
Update CorrectMatchesManager to work with the new brand/model hierarchy structure.

First, write failing tests in tests/match/test_correct_matches_manager_new_structure.py that:

1. **Test handle section structure** - Should use catalog model names (Unspecified, Washington, etc.)
2. **Test model name extraction** - Should get model from catalog, not extract from source_text
3. **Test brand name preservation** - Should preserve proper casing from catalog
4. **Test split_brush compatibility** - Should maintain split_brush section functionality
5. **Test storage format** - Should store full source_text under appropriate model

Then implement the changes:

1. **Update _extract_split_brush_components** - Use catalog model names
2. **Update handle section saving** - Use brand/model hierarchy from catalog
3. **Maintain split_brush section** - Keep existing split_brush functionality
4. **Update tests** - Ensure all existing tests still pass

Focus on the CorrectMatchesManager changes without changing the YAML structure yet.
```

### Step 8: Fix Handle Section Structure in Correct Matches

```text
Fix the handle section structure in correct_matches.yaml to use proper brand/model hierarchy.

Write tests in tests/match/test_correct_matches_structure.py that validate:

1. **Handle section format** - Should match knots section structure
2. **Model name usage** - Should use catalog model names (Unspecified, Washington, etc.)
3. **Source text storage** - Should store full source_text under appropriate model
4. **Casing consistency** - Proper brand casing, lowercase storage
5. **No duplicates** - No duplicate brand/model entries

Implement the structure fixes:

1. **Update handle section format** - Use brand ‚Üí model ‚Üí source_text structure
2. **Use catalog model names** - Get model names from handles.yaml, not extraction
3. **Store full source_text** - Keep complete source_text under model
4. **Maintain lowercase storage** - Store strings in lowercase for consistency
5. **Prevent duplicates** - Ensure no duplicate brand/model combinations

Test with real data to ensure the structure is correct and consistent.
```

### Step 9: Add Integration Tests for Correct Matches

```text
Add comprehensive integration tests for correct matches functionality with the new structure.

Create tests in tests/match/test_correct_matches_integration.py that cover:

1. **End-to-end workflow** - Save correct matches, reload, verify structure
2. **Handle section validation** - Verify brand/model hierarchy in saved YAML
3. **Split brush compatibility** - Ensure split_brush section still works
4. **Multiple entries** - Test saving multiple handle entries
5. **Model name consistency** - Verify catalog model names are used correctly
6. **Casing preservation** - Test proper brand casing and lowercase storage

Include test scenarios for:
- Declaration Grooming Washington/Jefferson/Jeffington models
- Jayaruh with Unspecified model
- Dogwood Handcrafts with Unspecified model
- Mixed scenarios with specific and general models

Validate that the integration between handle matchers and correct matches manager works correctly with the new structure.
```

### Step 10: Restructure Handles.yaml

```text
Transform the current handles.yaml to the new brand/model hierarchy structure.

Based on the analysis from Step 1 and design from Step 3, restructure data/handles.yaml:

1. **Extract specific models** - Move Washington, Jefferson, Jeffington patterns to their own model sections
2. **Add "Unspecified" model** - Create Unspecified model for general brand patterns
3. **Reorganize patterns** - Move patterns to appropriate model sections
4. **Maintain all patterns** - Ensure no patterns are lost during restructuring
5. **Validate structure** - Verify the new structure matches knots.yaml pattern

Key transformations:
- Declaration Grooming: Extract Washington, Jefferson, Jeffington models, keep general patterns under Unspecified
- Jayaruh: Create Unspecified model with existing patterns
- Dogwood Handcrafts: Create Unspecified model with existing patterns
- Other brands: Apply same pattern

Validate that the new structure is syntactically correct and follows the established pattern.
```

### Step 11: Validate New YAML Structure

```text
Validate that the new handles.yaml structure works correctly with all existing functionality.

Create validation tests in tests/match/test_handles_yaml_validation.py that:

1. **Test all patterns** - Verify every pattern from the old structure still works
2. **Test new models** - Verify Washington, Jefferson, Jeffington models work correctly
3. **Test "Unspecified" model** - Verify general brand patterns work under Unspecified
4. **Test performance** - Ensure no significant performance regression
5. **Test integration** - Verify handle matchers work with new structure
6. **Test correct matches** - Verify correct matches manager works with new structure

Run comprehensive validation:
- Test all existing patterns with real SOTD data
- Verify brand/model extraction works correctly
- Check that no patterns were lost during restructuring
- Validate performance is acceptable
- Ensure all tests pass with new structure

Fix any issues discovered during validation.
```

### Step 12: Update Dependent Code

```text
Update any remaining dependent code that might be affected by the handles.yaml restructuring.

Identify and update:

1. **Brush matchers** - Any code that depends on handle matcher return format
2. **Brush splitting logic** - Code that uses handle matching results
3. **Analysis tools** - Any tools that analyze handle data
4. **Documentation** - Update any documentation that references handle structure
5. **Configuration** - Any configuration that depends on handle structure

Create tests in tests/match/test_dependent_code_integration.py that:

1. **Test brush splitting** - Verify brush splitting still works with new handle structure
2. **Test analysis tools** - Verify any handle analysis tools still work
3. **Test configuration** - Verify any handle-related configuration still works
4. **Test documentation** - Verify documentation examples still work

Fix any integration issues discovered during testing.
```

### Step 13: Comprehensive Integration Testing

```text
Run comprehensive integration testing to ensure the entire system works correctly with the new handles.yaml structure.

Create integration tests in tests/integration/test_handles_restructuring_integration.py that cover:

1. **End-to-end pipeline** - Test complete pipeline with new handle structure
2. **Match phase integration** - Test handle matching within match phase
3. **Correct matches workflow** - Test saving/loading correct matches with new structure
4. **Brush splitting integration** - Test brush splitting with new handle structure
5. **Performance validation** - Ensure no performance regression in match phase
6. **Data consistency** - Verify data consistency across all phases

Test scenarios:
- Complete pipeline run with new handles.yaml
- Handle matching with specific models (Washington, Jefferson, Jeffington)
- Handle matching with general models (Unspecified)
- Correct matches saving/loading with new structure
- Brush splitting with various handle types

Validate that the entire system works correctly with the new structure.
```

### Step 14: Performance Validation

```text
Validate that the handles.yaml restructuring doesn't cause performance regression.

Create performance tests in tests/performance/test_handles_performance.py that:

1. **Benchmark handle matching** - Compare performance before/after restructuring
2. **Test large datasets** - Test performance with large numbers of handles
3. **Test memory usage** - Verify no significant memory overhead
4. **Test pattern matching** - Benchmark pattern matching performance
5. **Test brand/model traversal** - Benchmark hierarchy traversal performance

Performance benchmarks:
- Handle matching performance (records per second)
- Memory usage during handle matching
- Pattern matching performance
- Brand/model hierarchy traversal performance
- Overall match phase performance impact

Ensure performance is within acceptable bounds (no more than 10% regression).
```

### Step 15: Documentation Updates

```text
Update all relevant documentation to reflect the new handles.yaml structure.

Update documentation files:

1. **handles.yaml documentation** - Document new brand/model hierarchy structure
2. **Handle matcher documentation** - Update matcher interface documentation
3. **Correct matches documentation** - Update correct matches structure documentation
4. **Migration guide** - Document the restructuring changes
5. **Examples** - Update examples to use new structure

Documentation updates:
