# Linter Error Systematic Fix Plan

## Overview
Create a systematic approach to identify, track, and fix all Python linter errors in the SOTD Pipeline project. The current linting process is timing out after 3 attempts, indicating a large number of errors that need organized handling.

## Problem Statement
- Cursor is timing out on linting after 3 tries
- Need to identify all Python linter errors systematically
- Need a tracking system to work through errors methodically
- Need to update progress as errors are fixed

## Solution Approach

### Phase 1: Error Discovery and Categorization
1. **Run comprehensive linter scan** to capture all errors
2. **Categorize errors by type** (E501 line length, F401 unused imports, etc.)
3. **Create error tracking file** with categorized list
4. **Prioritize by impact** (critical vs cosmetic)

### Phase 2: Systematic Fix Implementation
1. **Work through errors by category** (start with most common)
2. **Update tracking file** as errors are resolved
3. **Re-run linter** after each category to verify fixes
4. **Handle complex cases** that require discussion

### Phase 3: Validation and Cleanup
1. **Final linter run** to ensure all errors resolved
2. **Update tracking file** with completion status
3. **Document lessons learned** for future maintenance

## Implementation Details

### Error Tracking System
- **File**: `linter_errors_todo.md` - Markdown file for tracking progress
- **Structure**: Categorized by error type with file paths and line numbers
- **Status tracking**: TODO, IN_PROGRESS, COMPLETE, BLOCKED
- **Progress indicators**: Count of total vs resolved errors

### Linter Configuration
- **Tool**: Ruff (E, F, I rules as per pyproject.toml)
- **Line length**: 100 characters (Black setting)
- **Exclusions**: data/, tests/, .venv/, venv/ directories
- **Per-file ignores**: __init__.py files for F401

### Error Categories (Expected)
1. **E501**: Line too long (>100 characters)
2. **F401**: Unused imports
3. **F841**: Unused variables
4. **E401**: Multiple imports on same line
5. **I001**: Import block is un-sorted or un-formatted

### Fix Strategy
1. **Automated fixes first**: Use `ruff check --fix` for auto-fixable issues
2. **Manual fixes second**: Line length, complex import sorting
3. **Per-file ignores**: For intentional violations (tests, etc.)
4. **Configuration updates**: If patterns emerge that need rule changes

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All linter errors identified and categorized
- [ ] Error tracking system created and populated
- [ ] 90%+ of errors resolved systematically
- [ ] Linter runs complete without timeout
- [ ] No regressions in functionality
- [ ] Documentation updated with lessons learned

## Risk Mitigation
- **Backup strategy**: Use git for all changes (no manual backups needed per rules)
- **Incremental approach**: Fix by category to avoid overwhelming changes
- **Testing**: Run tests after each category to ensure no regressions
- **Rollback plan**: Git provides easy rollback for any problematic changes

## Timeline
- **Phase 1**: 1-2 hours (error discovery and categorization)
- **Phase 2**: 4-6 hours (systematic fixing by category)
- **Phase 3**: 1 hour (validation and cleanup)

## Dependencies
- Existing Ruff configuration in pyproject.toml
- Makefile lint target for consistent execution
- Git for change tracking and rollback capability

## Notes
- Follow project's fail-fast error handling approach
- Use temporary files for any file-writing operations during testing
- Update this plan file as progress is made
- Consider this a one-time cleanup effort with ongoing maintenance practices
