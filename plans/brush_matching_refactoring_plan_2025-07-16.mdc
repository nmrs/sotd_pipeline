# Brush Matching Code Refactoring Plan - Revised

## üìò Project Summary

Refactor the monolithic `BrushMatcher` class (999 lines) into focused, maintainable components following SOLID principles while maintaining consistency with other matchers in the pipeline. The current implementation has grown complex with multiple responsibilities, but the refactoring should focus on **high-value components** rather than over-engineering.

**Goals:**
- Extract only high-value, reusable components
- Maintain consistency with other matchers (razor, blade, soap)
- Improve testability through better separation of concerns
- Reduce code duplication and complexity
- Maintain existing functionality while improving structure
- Standardize return types across all matchers

**Current State:**
- `BrushMatcher` class: 999 lines with multiple responsibilities
- Complex nested logic in `match()` method (200+ lines)
- Duplicated loading and error handling logic
- Scattered caching implementation
- Hard-coded configuration management
- **Inconsistent architecture** with other matchers

**Target State:**
- Focused components with clear responsibilities
- **Consistent architecture** with other matchers
- Improved error handling and logging
- Centralized configuration management
- Better caching strategy
- Enhanced testability and maintainability
- **Standardized return types** across all matchers
