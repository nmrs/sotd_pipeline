# Split Brush Correct Matches Fix - TDD Implementation Plan

**Date**: 2025-07-30  
**Status**: TODO  
**Type**: Implementation Plan (TDD)  

## 📘 Project Summary

Implement split brush correct matches functionality for the SOTD Pipeline WebUI. This feature will enable users to mark split brushes (e.g., "Jayaruh #441 w/ AP Shave Co G5C") as correct matches, storing them in a new `split_brush` section in `correct_matches.yaml` with component references to separate `handle` and `knot` sections for efficient matching and component reuse.

**Key Features**:
- Detect split brushes from existing matched data (brand: null, model: null, handle/knot sections present)
- Extend MismatchAnalyzer to handle split brush identification and storage
- Add split brush display and filtering to WebUI
- Enable component reuse across different split brush combinations
- Follow DRY architecture using existing API endpoints

Extend the existing MismatchItem model to support split brush functionality. 

Context: The MismatchItem model is used by the MismatchAnalyzer to represent items that need user validation. We need to add split brush fields to support the new functionality.

Requirements:
- Add `is_split_brush: bool` field to indicate if this is a split brush item
- Add `handle_component: str` field to store the handle component string
- Add `knot_component: str` field to store the knot component string
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing fields
- Add type hints and docstrings for new fields

Location: Look for MismatchItem model in the webui/api/ directory or similar location.

Test Requirements:
- Unit tests for new fields
- Tests for backward compatibility
- Tests for field validation

Follow existing code patterns and naming conventions in the codebase.
```

### Step 2: Update MismatchAnalyzer Core

```text
Extend the MismatchAnalyzer class to detect and handle split brushes from existing matched data.

Context: The MismatchAnalyzer currently identifies mismatches for regular products. We need to add split brush detection logic that reads from existing matched data files.

Requirements:
- Add method to detect split brushes from matched data (brand: null, model: null, handle/knot sections present)
- Add method to extract handle/knot components from existing matched data
- Add method to save split brush mappings to correct_matches.yaml with new structure
- Add method to load split brush mappings from correct_matches.yaml
- Follow existing patterns for file I/O and data processing

Split Brush Detection Logic:
- Check for brand: null AND model: null AND presence of handle section AND/OR knot section
- Support three types of split brushes:
  - Handle-only: brand=null, model=null, handle section exists, no knot section
  - Knot-only: brand=null, model=null, knot section exists, no handle section
  - Both components: brand=null, model=null, both handle and knot sections exist
- Extract handle/knot components from existing matched data
- Create MismatchItem with is_split_brush=True and component fields populated

Data Structure for correct_matches.yaml:
```yaml
split_brush:
  "Jayaruh #441 w/ AP Shave Co G5C":
    handle: "Jayaruh #441"
    knot: "AP Shave Co G5C"

handle:
  Jayaruh:
    "#441":
      - "Jayaruh #441"

knot:
  "AP Shave Co":
    "G5C":
      - "AP Shave Co G5C"
```

Test Requirements:
- Unit tests for split brush detection logic

### Step 11: Performance Validation

```text
Validate that the split brush functionality performs efficiently and doesn't introduce performance regressions.

Context: Split brush functionality involves additional data processing and storage. We need to ensure it performs well with large datasets and doesn't impact existing functionality.

Test Requirements:

1. Data Processing Performance:
   - Test split brush detection speed with large matched data files
   - Test component extraction efficiency
   - Test save/load operations performance
   - Test memory usage during processing

2. Component Lookup Performance:
   - Test efficiency of component reuse across combinations
   - Test lookup speed for existing split brush mappings
   - Test performance with many component variations
   - Test memory efficiency of component storage

3. API Performance:
   - Test endpoint response times with split brush data
   - Test concurrent request handling
   - Test memory usage during API operations
   - Test database/file I/O performance

4. UI Performance:
   - Test rendering performance with many split brush items
   - Test filter operation speed
   - Test memory usage during UI interactions
   - Test responsiveness during user interactions

5. Comparison Tests:
   - Compare performance with existing brush functionality
   - Test performance impact on regular brush operations
   - Test overall system performance with mixed data
   - Test performance under load

Performance Requirements:
- Split brush detection: < 1 second for typical monthly data
- Component lookup: < 100ms for existing mappings
- UI rendering: < 500ms for 1000+ items
- Memory usage: < 50MB additional for large datasets
- No performance regression for existing functionality

Use performance profiling tools and create benchmarks for comparison. Test with realistic data sizes and usage patterns.
```

### Step 12: Documentation Update

1. **Foundation First**: Steps 1-3 establish the core data structures and business logic
2. **API Integration**: Steps 4-6 extend existing endpoints and test integration
3. **User Interface**: Steps 7-9 update the UI components and add filtering
4. **Validation**: Steps 10-12 ensure quality and performance

### Strengths

- **Incremental Approach**: Each step builds on previous work without large jumps
- **Test-First**: Every step includes comprehensive testing requirements
- **DRY Architecture**: Extends existing components rather than creating new ones
- **Real-World Focus**: Uses actual SOTD data patterns and community examples
- **Performance Conscious**: Includes performance validation and optimization

### Risk Mitigation

- **Backward Compatibility**: Each step maintains existing functionality
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling throughout the pipeline
- **Testing Coverage**: Multiple levels of testing (unit, integration, E2E, performance)
- **Incremental Validation**: Each step can be validated independently

### Dependencies and Integration

- **No Orphaned Code**: Each step integrates with existing systems
- **Clear Interfaces**: Well-defined data structures and API contracts
- **Consistent Patterns**: Follows existing codebase conventions
- **Modular Design**: Components can be developed and tested independently

### Implementation Safety

- **Small Steps**: Each step is small enough to implement safely
- **Testable Output**: Every step produces testable, coherent code
- **Clear Requirements**: Each prompt has specific, actionable requirements
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of edge cases and failures

The plan is lean, safe, and buildable with no dangling pieces. Each step provides meaningful progress while maintaining system stability and code quality.
