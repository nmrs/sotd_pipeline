# Test Suite Performance Optimization Plan

## Overview

This plan addresses performance bottlenecks in the SOTD Pipeline test suite, targeting a 75-85% reduction in test runtime (from ~27 seconds to ~5-7 seconds) through systematic optimization of the top 10 slowest test files.

## Current State Analysis

### Performance Baseline
- **Total runtime:** ~27 seconds
- **Total tests:** 1,473 tests across 112 files
- **Main bottlenecks:** Repeated matcher instantiation, YAML I/O, integration tests
- **Slowest individual tests:** 1.9s, 0.9s, 0.8s

### Top 10 Slowest Test Files (Prioritized)
1. **tests/match/tools/test_validate_correct_matches.py** - Catalog validation (~1.9s slowest test)
2. **tests/match/test_normalization_consistency.py** - Integration checks (~0.8-0.9s each)
3. **tests/integration/test_real_catalog_integration.py** - Real YAML integration (~0.8-0.9s each)
4. **tests/match/test_blade_matcher.py** - Many slow setups (~0.33-0.37s each)
5. **tests/match/test_match_integration.py** - Integration tests (~0.37s)
6. **tests/match/test_brush_matcher.py** - High test count (36 tests)
7. **tests/match/test_razor_matcher.py** - High test count (21 tests)
8. **tests/match/test_soap_matcher.py** - Moderate count (14 tests)
9. **tests/match/test_base_matcher.py** - Foundational logic (13 tests)
10. **tests/utils/test_performance_integration.py** - Performance checks (8 tests)

## Optimization Strategy

### Phase 1: High-Impact Fixture Optimization (Week 1) - ✅ COMPLETED
**Target:** 40-50% runtime reduction

#### Priority 1: Session-Scoped Fixtures - ✅ COMPLETED
- **File:** `tests/match/tools/test_validate_correct_matches.py`
- **Action:** Convert class-scoped fixtures to session-scoped
- **Expected impact:** Eliminate repeated `ValidateCorrectMatches` instantiation
- **Implementation:**
  ```python
  @pytest.fixture(scope="session")
  def validator():
      return ValidateCorrectMatches()
  
  @pytest.fixture(scope="session")
  def catalog_data():
      return load_yaml_with_nfc(Path("data/razors.yaml"))
  ```

#### Priority 2: Matcher Fixture Optimization - ✅ COMPLETED
- **Files:** `tests/match/test_normalization_consistency.py`, `tests/integration/test_real_catalog_integration.py`
- **Action:** Create session-scoped matcher fixtures
- **Expected impact:** Eliminate repeated matcher instantiation and YAML loading
- **Implementation:**
  ```python
  @pytest.fixture(scope="session")
  def all_matchers():
      return {
          "razor": RazorMatcher(Path("data/razors.yaml")),
          "blade": BladeMatcher(Path("data/blades.yaml")),
          "brush": BrushMatcher(Path("data/brushes.yaml"), Path("data/handles.yaml")),
          "soap": SoapMatcher(Path("data/soaps.yaml")),
      }
  ```

#### Priority 3: Blade Matcher Parameterization - ✅ COMPLETED
- **File:** `tests/match/test_blade_matcher.py`
- **Action:** Parameterize use count and format/context tests
- **Expected impact:** Reduce test function overhead and eliminate redundancy
- **Implementation:**
  ```python
  @pytest.mark.parametrize("input_text,expected_brand,expected_model", [
      ("Feather (3)", "Feather", "DE"),
      ("Astra SP [5]", "Astra", "Superior Platinum (Green)"),
      ("Derby Extra {7}", "Derby", "Extra"),
      # ... all use count variations
  ])
  def test_match_with_use_count_variations(matcher, input_text, expected_brand, expected_model):
      result = matcher.match(input_text)
      assert result["matched"]["brand"] == expected_brand
      assert result["matched"]["model"] == expected_model
  ```

### Phase 2: Parallel Execution (Week 2)
**Target:** Additional 3-4x speedup

#### Priority 1: Parallel Test Configuration
- **Action:** Configure `pytest-xdist` for optimal parallel execution
- **Implementation:**
  ```bash
  # Add to pyproject.toml or pytest.ini
  addopts = "-n auto --dist=loadfile"
  ```
- **Expected impact:** 3-4x speedup on multi-core machines

#### Priority 2: Test Independence Optimization
- **Action:** Ensure tests can run in parallel without conflicts
- **Focus areas:** Temporary file usage, shared state, database connections
- **Implementation:** Review and fix any test interdependencies

### Phase 3: Fine-Tuning and Cleanup (Week 3)
**Target:** Final 10-20% improvement

#### Priority 1: Redundant Test Removal
- **Action:** Identify and remove unnecessary tests
- **Focus areas:** Attribute existence tests, import tests, duplicate coverage
- **Expected impact:** 5-10% reduction in test count

#### Priority 2: Integration Test Optimization
- **Action:** Mark slow integration tests with `@pytest.mark.slow`
- **Implementation:** Add selective running for CI vs. local development

## Lessons Learned

### Performance Patterns
- **Session-scoped fixtures:** Most effective for expensive setup
- **Parameterization:** Best for similar test logic with different inputs
- **Parallel execution:** Greatest impact on independent tests
- **YAML I/O:** Major bottleneck in matcher tests

### Best Practices
- **Test independence:** Critical for parallel execution
- **Fixture scope:** Choose appropriate scope for resource cost
- **Parameterization:** Use for similar logic, not just similar assertions
- **Incremental optimization:** Measure impact of each change

### Key Decision: Test Intent vs. Parameterization

#### Decision Made: Prioritize Test Intent Over Aggressive Parameterization
**Context:** During optimization of `test_brush_matcher.py`, we initially parameterized similar tests but encountered assertion mismatches due to differences in expected vs. actual matcher outputs (e.g., match_type "exact" vs "regex").

**Decision:** Reverted to individual tests for clarity and intent preservation.

**Rationale:**
1. **Test Clarity:** Individual tests with descriptive names are easier to understand and debug
2. **Intent Preservation:** Each test case has specific business logic that should be clearly visible
3. **Maintainability:** When matcher behavior changes, individual tests are easier to update
4. **Debugging:** Failed parameterized tests are harder to debug than individual test failures

**Example from `test_brush_matcher.py`:**
```python
# ❌ Parameterized approach (reverted)
@pytest.mark.parametrize("input_text,expected_brand,expected_model", [
    ("Simpson Chubby 2", "Simpson", "Chubby 2"),
    ("Declaration B15", "Declaration Grooming", "B15"),
])
def test_brush_matching_variations(matcher, input_text, expected_brand, expected_model):
    result = matcher.match(input_text)
    assert result["matched"]["brand"] == expected_brand
    assert result["matched"]["model"] == expected_model

# ✅ Individual tests (preserved)
def test_simpson_chubby_2_matching(matcher):
    """Test Simpson Chubby 2 matches correctly."""
    result = matcher.match("Simpson Chubby 2")
    assert result["matched"]["brand"] == "Simpson"
    assert result["matched"]["model"] == "Chubby 2"

def test_declaration_b15_matching(matcher):
    """Test Declaration B15 matches correctly."""
    result = matcher.match("Declaration B15")
    assert result["matched"]["brand"] == "Declaration Grooming"
    assert result["matched"]["model"] == "B15"
```

**Impact:**
- **Performance:** Still achieved excellent speedup (29 tests in 1.87s)
- **Clarity:** Each test case is self-documenting
- **Maintainability:** Easier to modify individual test logic
- **Debugging:** Clear test names in failure reports

**Future Guidance:**
- Use parameterization only when test logic is truly identical
- Prefer individual tests when business logic or assertions differ
- Session-scoped fixtures provide most performance benefit
- Test intent and clarity are more valuable than minor performance gains

## Conclusion

This optimization plan targets the most impactful performance bottlenecks in the test suite. By focusing on fixture optimization, parameterization, and parallel execution, we expect to achieve a 75-85% reduction in test runtime while maintaining or improving test coverage and maintainability.

The plan is designed to be implemented incrementally, with each phase building on the previous one and providing measurable improvements. Success will be measured by both quantitative metrics (runtime reduction) and qualitative improvements (faster development feedback loops).
