## Quality Assurance and Testing

### Data Validation and Pipeline Integrity
**CRITICAL**: All refactoring must preserve exact pipeline output integrity.

#### Pre/Post Change Validation
- [ ] **BEFORE** making changes: Run pipeline on real data and capture output
- [ ] **AFTER** making changes: Run pipeline on same data and compare outputs
- [ ] **Validation**: Ensure identical results (same data structure, same values, same file sizes)
- [ ] **Test Data**: Use existing data in `data/` directory (comments, extracted, matched, enriched, aggregated)
- [ ] **Test Scenarios**: Test with multiple months, annual aggregation, and report generation

#### Pipeline Testing Commands
```bash
# Test monthly pipeline end-to-end
python run.py fetch --month 2025-01 --force
python run.py extract --month 2025-01 --force  
python run.py match --month 2025-01 --force
python run.py enrich --month 2025-01 --force
python run.py aggregate --month 2025-01 --force
python run.py report --month 2025-01 --type hardware --force

# Test annual pipeline
python run.py aggregate --annual --year 2024 --force
python run.py report --annual --year 2024 --type hardware --force

# Compare outputs before/after changes
diff data/matched/2025-01.json data/matched/2025-01.json.backup
diff data/aggregated/2025-01.json data/aggregated/2025-01.json.backup
```

#### Data Integrity Checks
- [ ] **File Structure**: Verify JSON structure matches expected format
- [ ] **Data Counts**: Ensure same number of records, same metadata values
- [ ] **Content Validation**: Spot-check key fields for accuracy
- [ ] **Performance**: Ensure no significant performance regressions
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Test with edge cases (missing files, corrupted data)

### Integration Testing Strategy
- [ ] Create integration tests for each refactored module
- [ ] Ensure all existing functionality is preserved
- [ ] Test edge cases and error conditions
- [ ] Verify performance characteristics are maintained

### Documentation Updates
- [ ] Update all relevant documentation to reflect refactored APIs
- [ ] Create migration guides for any breaking changes
- [ ] Update examples and tutorials
- [ ] Document new utility functions and base classes

### Performance Validation
- [ ] Run performance benchmarks before and after refactoring
- [ ] Ensure no performance regressions
- [ ] Validate memory usage patterns
- [ ] Test with large datasets

## Success Criteria

### Code Quality Metrics
- [ ] Eliminate target of 800-1000 lines of duplicated code
- [ ] Maintain or improve test coverage (target: >90%)
- [ ] All quality checks pass consistently
- [ ] No new linting errors introduced

### Functionality Validation
