# Brush Table Specialized Component - TDD Implementation Plan

## üìò Project Summary

Create a specialized React component for displaying brush data in the unmatched analyzer web UI. Unlike other product types which are single entities, brushes have complex multi-component structure with handle and knot components that may match independently. This component provides granular visibility into brush matching complexity while maintaining consistency with existing UI patterns.

**Key Challenge**: Transform complex brush matching data into an intuitive hierarchical display with independent component-level filtering capabilities.

**Success Criteria**: Users can identify problematic brush components, filter them independently, and maintain the same performance and UX patterns as existing product tables.
