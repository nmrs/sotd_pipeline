## Quality Classification System for Catalog Entries

Based on this analysis, we can define catalog quality classifications:

### Tier 1: Premium Catalog Entries (Score 85-100)
- **Complete entries** (4+ quality fields) from manufacturer or established artisan brands
- **High authority** + **high completeness** = highest confidence
- **Usage**: Boost match scores by +15-20 points

### Tier 2: Good Catalog Entries (Score 70-84)  
- **Substantial entries** (3 quality fields) from any authority level
- **Moderate entries** (2 quality fields) from manufacturer/established artisan
- **Medium authority** + **good completeness** = good confidence
- **Usage**: Boost match scores by +10-15 points

### Tier 3: Basic Catalog Entries (Score 55-69)
- **Basic entries** (1 quality field) from any authority level
- **Minimal entries** from manufacturer/established artisan
- **Lower completeness** but some catalog presence = basic confidence
- **Usage**: Boost match scores by +5-10 points

### Tier 4: Minimal Catalog Entries (Score 40-54)
- **Minimal entries** (0 quality fields) from emerging/unknown brands
- **Placeholder entries** with brand/model only
- **Limited confidence** but catalog presence noted
- **Usage**: Boost match scores by +0-5 points

### Tier 5: No Catalog Entry (Score 0-39)
- **No catalog presence** for the brand
- **Unknown quality** and specifications
- **No confidence boost** from catalog
- **Usage**: No catalog-based score modification

## Implementation Recommendations

### Immediate Catalog Improvements
1. **Add high-volume missing brands**: Focus on top 10 uncataloged brands first
2. **Complete manufacturer entries**: Prioritize manufacturer brands for full specifications
3. **Verify low-volume entries**: Review accuracy of cataloged brands with 0-2 matches

### Scoring System Integration
1. **Implement catalog quality modifiers**: Use 5-tier system for match score boosts
2. **Authority-based bonuses**: Additional points for manufacturer/established artisan matches
3. **Completeness penalties**: Reduce confidence for minimal catalog entries

### Quality Assurance Priorities
1. **Data validation**: Verify accuracy of existing high-quality entries
2. **Standardization**: Ensure consistent field naming and value formats
3. **Coverage expansion**: Target 80%+ coverage rate by volume for Phase 4.2
