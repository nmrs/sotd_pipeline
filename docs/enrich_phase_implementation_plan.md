# Enrich Phase Implementation Plan

This document tracks the step-by-step implementation of the SOTD Pipeline enrich phase. Each item can be checked off as completed, allowing us to stop and resume work at any point.

## Overview

The enrich phase performs sophisticated analysis requiring knowledge of matched products to extract detailed specifications and metadata that don't affect product identification.

**Key Architecture Decisions Made:**
- Enrich phase handles "sophisticated analysis requiring knowledge of the matched product first"
- Match phase focuses on "product identification"
- Self-determination pattern: each enricher decides its own applicability
- Field-focused routing: enrichers target specific fields ("blade", "razor", "brush", "soap")
- Fail-fast error handling for internal/logic errors
- Graceful handling for external/API errors

## Enrichment Extraction Source Clarification

**IMPORTANT:**
- All enrichers that extract user-supplied details (e.g., fiber, knot size, plate, gap, variant, etc.) must extract from the relevant extracted field (e.g., `brush_extracted`, `razor_extracted`, `blade_extracted`, `soap_extracted`).
- Do **NOT** extract from the full comment (may contain unrelated info) or from the matched/canonical field (catalog only, loses user details).
- The extract phase is responsible for parsing the original SOTD comment and extracting each product field as entered by the user. These extracted fields are the correct source for user-supplied enrichment.

## Implementation Chunks

### Phase 1: Foundation Infrastructure
- [x] **1.1** Create base enricher interface (`BaseEnricher`)
  - `target_field` property
  - `applies_to(record)` method
  - `enrich(field_data)` method
- [x] **1.2** Create enricher registry/manager system
- [x] **1.3** Set up basic testing framework for enrichers
- [x] **1.4** Create core enrich module structure in `sotd/enrich/`

### Phase 2: Blade Count Enricher (Migration from Match)
- [x] **2.1** Implement `BladeCountEnricher` class
- [x] **2.2** Move blade count extraction regex patterns from `blade_matcher.py`
- [x] **2.3** Add comprehensive tests for blade count extraction
- [x] **2.4** Validate extraction accuracy against existing data

### Phase 3: Straight Razor Enricher
- [x] **3.1** Implement `StraightRazorEnricher` class
- [x] **3.2** Create grind extraction patterns (wedge, quarter hollow, half hollow, full hollow, etc.)
- [x] **3.3** Create width extraction patterns (4/8", 5/8", 6/8", 7/8", 8/8")
- [x] **3.4** Create point type extraction patterns (round, square, French, Spanish, etc.)
- [x] **3.5** Add comprehensive tests with real comment examples
- [x] **3.6** Handle multiple specification formats and edge cases
- [x] **3.7** Preserve catalog data from match phase (e.g., Koraat Moarteen specifications)
- [x] **3.8** Merge user comment data with catalog data (user takes precedence)

### Phase 4: DE Plate Enrichers
- [x] **4.1** Implement `GameChangerEnricher` class
  - Gap detection (.68, .76, .84, 1.05)
  - Variant detection (Game Changer, Game Changer 2.0, Game Changer Jaws, OC)
- [x] **4.2** Implement `ChristopherBradleyEnricher` class  
  - Plate level extraction (AA-G)
  - Plate type extraction (SB/OC, SB default)
- [x] **4.3** Add comprehensive tests for both enrichers
- [x] **4.4** Validate against known product specifications

> **Note:** Both GameChangerEnricher and ChristopherBradleyEnricher are finalized. All tests pass. Logic matches current product specs and user requirements. Parsing is from the razor field only. No gap/variant restrictions for Game Changer. Christopher Bradley extracts plate level (AA-G) and plate type (SB/OC, SB default).

- [ ] **5.2** Create `sotd/enrich/save.py` for file I/O operations
  - Read from `data/matched/YYYY-MM.json`
  - Write to `data/enriched/YYYY-MM.json`
  - Include comprehensive metadata
- [ ] **5.3** Add enrich command to main CLI (`cli.py`)
- [ ] **5.4** Update Makefile with enrich phase targets

### Phase 6: Integration and Migration

## Notes and Decisions Made

- **Architecture Philosophy**: Enrich phase handles sophisticated analysis requiring knowledge of matched products, while match phase focuses on product identification
- **Error Handling**: Fail fast for internal/logic errors, handle gracefully for external/API errors  
- **Self-Determination Pattern**: Each enricher decides its own applicability rather than complex routing logic
- **Metadata Standards**: Always include `_enriched_by` and `_extraction_source` fields
- **Partial Extraction**: Include successfully extracted fields, set missing fields to null
- **Field-Focused Routing**: Each enricher targets specific field types
- **Fiber Parsing Architecture**: Fiber parsing remains in match phase for product identification and model naming (especially for other_brushes strategy), but fiber conflict resolution moves to enrich phase for better user input handling
- **Catalog Data Preservation**: Match phase preserves all YAML catalog specifications, enrich phase merges with user specifications

## Architecture Patterns
- **Phase Structure**: Each phase follows the pattern: `run.py` (CLI), core logic modules, `save.py` (I/O)
- **Matcher Strategy**: Use BaseMatcher as base class for all product matchers
- **YAML Catalogs**: Store product data in YAML files under `data/` directory
- **Data Flow**: Each phase reads from previous phase output, writes to `data/{phase}/YYYY-MM.json`
- **Enrichment Extraction Source**: All user-supplied enrichment must extract from the relevant extracted field (e.g., `brush_extracted`), not the full comment or matched field.

---

**Last Updated**: Phase 3 completed with catalog data preservation
**Current Phase**: Phase 5 - CLI and I/O Infrastructure
**Next Prompt**: P6 - CLI Interface Implementation

**Note**: Catalog data preservation enhancement completed - match phase now preserves all YAML catalog specifications (e.g., Koraat Moarteen grind, width, point) and enrich phase merges with user specifications.
