# PRD: SOTD Fetch Phase

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| **Status** | Draft for rebuild |
| **Date** | 2026-08-07 |
| **Product** | SOTD Pipeline — Phase 1 (Fetch) |
| **Audience** | Engineers rebuilding fetch as a greenfield component |
| **Fidelity** | Faithful reverse-spec of current production behavior |

This document defines product requirements for rebuilding the **fetch** phase from scratch so a new implementation can match today’s capabilities and contracts without relying on the existing codebase as the source of truth.

---

## 1. Overview

Fetch is the first phase of the Shave of the Day (SOTD) data pipeline. It pulls **r/wetshaving** SOTD threads and their **top-level comments** for one or more calendar months, then writes durable monthly JSON under a configurable data directory (default `data/`).

**Position in the pipeline**

```
Reddit → [fetch] → extract → match → enrich → aggregate → report
```

**What fetch owns**

- Discover SOTD threads for a month
- Harvest top-level (root) comments from those threads
- Persist month-scoped artifacts with completeness metadata
- Support re-runs (merge or force overwrite) and manual include/exclude overrides

**What fetch does not own**

- Parsing product fields from comment bodies (razor, blade, brush, soap, etc.)
- Downstream phases (extract and later)
- Web UI or multi-subreddit collection

Downstream **extract** consumes `comments/YYYY-MM.json` only. Fetch must produce that contract unchanged; it must not parse product fields.

---

## 2. Problem & Goals

### 2.1 Problem

r/wetshaving posts daily SOTD threads. Individual shave write-ups live in **top-level comments**. Reddit search is incomplete in practice (result caps, flair/title variance, joke or non-SOTD threads that still match search). Operators need reliable, month-scoped, re-runnable collection with clear gap reporting and curated corrections—not one-shot scrapes.

### 2.2 Goals

1. Collect all discoverable SOTD threads for a month (title date in that month) plus top-level comments.
2. Persist stable monthly artifacts so extract can run without live Reddit access.
3. Support re-runs: merge by id by default; `--force` for clean overwrite.
4. Surface coverage gaps (`missing_days`, audit mode, threads missing comments).
5. Allow curated include/exclude via `thread_overrides.yaml`.

### 2.3 Success metrics (rebuild)

A rebuild is successful when:

- The same CLI date matrix and operational flags work as specified in §7.
- Output schemas match §6 (field names and meta shape).
- Merge and `--force` semantics match §4 / §6.
- Rate-limit handling does not abort a full month on typical transient Reddit limits (retry/backoff).
- Missing-day and audit reporting work for historical and current months.
- Existing extract can consume rebuilt comments JSON without schema changes.

### 2.4 Non-goals (this phase)

- Product field parsing
- Pushshift or third-party archives (current production fetch is **PRAW-only**)
- Nested reply comments
- WebUI
- Multi-subreddit support
- Changing the override schema or inventing new output fields beyond today’s contract

---

## 3. Users & Use Cases

**Primary user:** Pipeline operator (local CLI or scheduled job).

| ID | Use case | Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| UC1 | Fetch one month | `--month YYYY-MM` → write/merge `threads/` + `comments/` |
| UC2 | Fetch year / range | `--year`, `--range A:B`, or `--start` + `--end` |
| UC3 | Fresh rebuild | `--force` removes existing month files, then writes new |
| UC4 | Incremental refresh | Without `--force`, merge by `id` (newer `created_utc` wins) |
| UC5 | Completeness check | `--audit` reports missing files / `missing_days` (exit `1` if gaps) |
| UC6 | Inventory | `--list-months` prints months with any threads or comments file |
| UC7 | Manual correction | Edit `thread_overrides.yaml`; re-fetch (`--force` required to drop already-saved excludes) |

---

## 4. Functional Requirements

### 4.1 P0 — Must ship

| ID | Requirement |
| --- | --- |
| F1 | Authenticate via PRAW using `praw.ini` in the project root; fail fast if credentials are unusable. |
| F2 | Search r/wetshaving with Lucene queries combining `flair:SOTD`, month abbreviation/name, and year. |
| F3 | If search hits the ~100-result cap, run day-specific follow-up searches for under-covered days. For the **current** calendar month, only check through **today**. |
| F4 | Keep threads whose title date parses to the target `YYYY-MM`. Drop unparsable or wrong-month titles, except **include** overrides that may supply a YAML date fallback when the title is unparsable. |
| F5 | Fetch **top-level (root) comments only**; expand Reddit “more comments” / `MoreComments` objects so the root set is complete. |
| F6 | Fetch comments in parallel with rate-limit-aware retries; on per-thread failure, return empty comments for that thread rather than failing the whole month. |
| F7 | Apply `include` / `exclude` from `data/thread_overrides.yaml`, scoped to the fetched month. |
| F8 | Write `threads/YYYY-MM.json` and `comments/YYYY-MM.json` as `{ "meta": ..., "data": ... }` under the configured data directory. |
| F9 | Default merge by `id` (later `created_utc` wins). `--force` deletes existing month files before rewrite. |
| F10 | Compute `missing_days`: calendar days in the month with no thread whose title (or override) date falls on that day. |
| F11 | Support the date-span CLI: `--month` / `--year` / `--range` / `--start`+`--end`, plus shared flags `--force`, `--debug`, `--verbose`, `--data-dir`. |
| F12 | Support `--audit` and `--list-months` as in UC5 / UC6. |

### 4.2 P1 — Match current behavior; deferrable for a thin MVP cut

| ID | Requirement |
| --- | --- |
| F13 | Verbose completion summary (thread/comment counts, missing days). |
| F14 | Debug logging for search queries, skipped threads/reasons, and override validation. |
| F15 | Optional performance metrics on the parallel comment path. |
| F16 | If zero threads are found for a month, warn and skip file writes. |

### 4.3 Thread discovery details (normative behavior)

**Broad search (example pattern)**

- `flair:SOTD {month_abbr} {month_name} {year}`
- Variant including concatenated `yearSOTD` as used in production search strategy

**Cap recovery**

1. Deduplicate submissions by Reddit submission id.
2. Filter to the target year/month via title-date parsing.
3. Group by day; determine max threads-per-day among days that have threads.
4. For days below that max (and within the day window for current month), issue day-specific flair+date queries and merge results.

**Validity filter**

- Title date must parse (month-name or numeric day patterns; year optional with year hint).
- Parsed `(year, month)` must equal the requested month.
- Include overrides may attach `_override_date` (`YYYY-MM-DD`) used when title date is missing.
- Sort kept threads by title/override date ascending.

**Coverage vs. created time**

Calendar coverage (`missing_days`, `expected_days`) is based on **title (or override) dates**, not Reddit `created_utc`.

---

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements

| Area | Requirement |
| --- | --- |
| Resilience | On Reddit rate limits, retry using explicit wait from headers/exception when available; otherwise exponential backoff with jitter. Soft-fail individual API calls where returning empty/`None` avoids aborting the whole month. |
| Performance | Parallel comment fetch via thread pool (production run path uses on the order of 10 workers). Sequential fallback if parallel execution fails. |
| Observability | Pipeline logging; `--debug` and `--verbose`; progress indication across months. |
| Security | Credentials only via `praw.ini` / environment—never committed as artifacts. |
| Portability | Configurable `--data-dir` (default `data`, or env-driven data dir conventions used by the pipeline). |
| Idempotency | Re-run without `--force` is merge-safe. Re-run with `--force` is a deterministic overwrite of that month’s files. |

---

## 6. Data Contracts

### 6.1 File layout

```
{data_dir}/
  threads/YYYY-MM.json
  comments/YYYY-MM.json
  thread_overrides.yaml   # operator-maintained input, not phase output
```

Both JSON files use UTF-8, pretty-print indent 2, envelope:

```json
{
  "meta": { },
  "data": [ ]
}
```

Records in `data` are sorted by `created_utc` ascending.

**ID format:** Production uses **bare** Reddit ids (no `t3_` / `t1_` prefix). Rebuilds must match that convention for extract compatibility.

### 6.2 Threads — `threads/YYYY-MM.json`

**Meta**

| Field | Type | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `month` | string | `YYYY-MM` |
| `extracted_at` | string | ISO-8601 timestamp of this write |
| `thread_count` | int | `len(data)` after merge |
| `expected_days` | int | Days in the calendar month |
| `missing_days` | string[] | ISO dates `YYYY-MM-DD` with no covering thread |

**Record**

| Field | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | string | Submission id |
| `title` | string | Thread title |
| `url` | string | Absolute Reddit permalink URL |
| `author` | string | Username, or `"[deleted]"` if missing |
| `created_utc` | string | ISO-8601 UTC, `Z` suffix preferred |
| `num_comments` | int | Reddit comment count |
| `flair` | string \| null | Link flair text |

**Example**

```json
{
  "meta": {
    "month": "2026-07",
    "extracted_at": "2026-08-05T17:01:07.626776+00:00",
    "thread_count": 31,
    "expected_days": 31,
    "missing_days": []
  },
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "1ukd9m0",
      "title": "Wednesday SOTD Thread - Jul 01, 2026",
      "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/1ukd9m0/wednesday_sotd_thread_jul_01_2026/",
      "author": "AutoModerator",
      "created_utc": "2026-07-01T06:00:46Z",
      "num_comments": 64,
      "flair": "SOTD"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 6.3 Comments — `comments/YYYY-MM.json`

**Meta**

| Field | Type | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `month` | string | `YYYY-MM` |
| `extracted_at` | string | ISO-8601 timestamp of this write |
| `comment_count` | int | `len(data)` after merge |
| `thread_count_with_comments` | int | Distinct `thread_id` values present in `data` |
| `missing_days` | string[] | Same coverage list as threads meta for the month |
| `threads_missing_comments` | string[] | Thread ids in threads data with no comments in `data` |

**Record**

| Field | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | string | Comment id |
| `thread_id` | string | Parent submission id |
| `thread_title` | string | Parent title (denormalized) |
| `url` | string | Absolute comment permalink |
| `author` | string | Username, or `"[deleted]"` if missing |
| `created_utc` | string | ISO-8601 UTC |
| `body` | string | Full comment markdown/text |

**Example (truncated)**

```json
{
  "meta": {
    "month": "2026-07",
    "extracted_at": "2026-08-05T17:01:07.626776+00:00",
    "comment_count": 1691,
    "thread_count_with_comments": 31,
    "missing_days": [],
    "threads_missing_comments": []
  },
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "ouuy2or",
      "thread_id": "1ukd9m0",
      "thread_title": "Wednesday SOTD Thread - Jul 01, 2026",
      "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/1ukd9m0/wednesday_sotd_thread_jul_01_2026/ouuy2or/",
      "author": "sandstorm99",
      "created_utc": "2026-07-01T06:18:31Z",
      "body": "...shave write-up..."
    }
  ]
}
```

### 6.4 Merge semantics

- Without `--force`: load existing month file if present; merge `new` onto `existing` by `id`; keep the record with the later `created_utc`; sort by `created_utc` ascending; always rewrite file with fresh `extracted_at` metadata.
- With `--force`: delete existing threads and comments files for that month (if present), then write only the newly fetched set.
- Zero threads: warn and **do not** write files (F16).

---

## 7. CLI Contract

### 7.1 Date selection

| Flag | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `--month YYYY-MM` | Single month |
| `--year YYYY` | All 12 months |
| `--range A:B` | Inclusive monthly `YYYY-MM:YYYY-MM`, or annual `YYYY:YYYY` (all months in each year) |
| `--start YYYY-MM` + `--end YYYY-MM` | Inclusive span (both required together) |

Invalid / conflicting date combinations must error clearly (argparse / validation errors).

**Default month:** When invoked through the unified pipeline orchestrator (`run.py`) with no date flags, the orchestrator may inject a default (today: **previous calendar month**). The fetch phase itself expects an explicit month span once arguments are resolved; rebuilds should preserve orchestrator-compatible CLI flags even if default injection lives outside fetch.

### 7.2 Operational flags

| Flag | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `--force` | Overwrite: delete month outputs then rewrite |
| `--debug` | Debug logging (queries, skips, overrides) |
| `--verbose` | Richer INFO summaries / progress detail |
| `--data-dir PATH` | Data root (default `data`) |
| `--audit` | Completeness audit over selected months; no Reddit fetch |
| `--list-months` | Print months that have threads and/or comments files; exit |

### 7.3 Exit codes

| Code | When |
| --- | --- |
| `0` | Success; clean audit; successful list |
| `1` | Audit found missing files or missing days; interrupt; unhandled failure |

### 7.4 Example invocations

```bash
python run.py fetch --month 2025-05 --force
python run.py fetch --year 2024 --force
python run.py fetch --range 2024-01:2024-06 --force
python run.py fetch --start 2024-01 --end 2024-06 --force
python run.py fetch --month 2025-05 --audit
python run.py fetch --list-months
```

---

## 8. Override Contract

**File:** `data/thread_overrides.yaml` (relative to project / data conventions used by fetch).

```yaml
include:
  2025-06-25:
    - https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/1lk3ooa/wednesday_sotd_25_june/
exclude:
  2026-06-01:
    # Joke / non-SOTD thread that search still finds
    - https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/1ttrafo/monday_lather_games_sotd_thread_jun_1_2026/
```

| Section | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `include` | Force-fetch threads missed by search. Date key → list of Reddit URLs. Fetch by URL; attach YAML date as fallback when title date cannot be parsed. |
| `exclude` | Drop threads found by search. Match by submission id extracted from URL. |

**Scoping:** Only entries whose date keys start with the fetched `YYYY-MM` apply.

**Persistence note:** Re-fetch with `--force` is required to remove an already-saved excluded thread from monthly JSON.

**Legacy:** Root-level date keys (pre-`include`/`exclude` schema) should be detected and warned; operators should migrate under `include:` / `exclude:`.

---

## 9. Acceptance Criteria

The rebuild is accepted when all of the following are true:

1. **P0 complete:** F1–F12 behave as specified.
2. **Schema parity:** Threads and comments JSON match §6 field-for-field for meta and records.
3. **Merge / force:** Incremental merge and `--force` overwrite match §6.4.
4. **Overrides:** Include and exclude work for a month; force clears stale excludes from disk.
5. **Audit / inventory:** `--audit` and `--list-months` match UC5 / UC6 and exit codes in §7.3.
6. **Resilience:** A typical month completes despite intermittent rate limits (retries succeed or soft-fail per thread).
7. **Downstream smoke:** Extract run against rebuilt `comments/YYYY-MM.json` succeeds without schema adapters.
8. **Coverage signals:** `missing_days` and `threads_missing_comments` are populated consistently with discovery results.

---

## 10. Out of Scope

- Extract, match, enrich, aggregate, report
- Parsing razors/blades/brushes/soaps from comment text
- Pushshift or alternate archives
- Nested / reply comments
- WebUI or API surfaces for fetch
- Multi-subreddit fetching
- Redesigning `thread_overrides.yaml` schema
- Adding new output fields not present in §6

---

## 11. Dependencies & Assumptions

| Dependency | Assumption |
| --- | --- |
| Reddit API via PRAW | Operator provides working `praw.ini` in project root |
| Subreddit | `r/wetshaving` (search target name `wetshaving`) |
| Flair | Primary discovery signal is `flair:SOTD` |
| Title dates | Thread titles contain a parseable calendar date used for month membership and coverage |
| Python tooling | Rebuild may choose stack freely, but must honor CLI and data contracts for pipeline integration |
| Data directory | Default `data/`; must remain compatible with later phases’ expected paths |

---

## 12. Open Risks (known from current product)

| Risk | Mitigation already in product |
| --- | --- |
| Reddit 100-result search cap | Day-specific follow-up searches (F3) |
| Threads missed by search | `include` overrides (F7) |
| Non-SOTD threads matching search | `exclude` overrides (F7) |
| Rate limiting under parallel comment fetch | Retry/backoff; soft-fail per thread (F6, §5) |
| Incomplete months | `missing_days` + `--audit` (F10, F12) |

These are accepted product realities, not rebuild stretch goals—unless a later PRD explicitly expands scope.

---

## Appendix A — Reference architecture (logical modules)

A rebuild may structure code differently, but responsibilities today map cleanly to:

| Concern | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| CLI / orchestration | Parse args, iterate months, summary, exit codes |
| Reddit client | Auth, search, submission fetch, root comments, rate-limit wrapper |
| Overrides | Load YAML; include by URL; exclude by id |
| Merge | Deduplicate by id, prefer newer `created_utc` |
| Persistence | Read/write `{meta, data}` month files |
| Audit | Missing files and meta `missing_days` over a month span |

---

## Appendix B — Document history

| Date | Change |
