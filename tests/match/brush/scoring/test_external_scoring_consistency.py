Tests for external scoring consistency across all strategy types.

This test file validates that all strategies follow the same external scoring pattern:
1. Strategies return basic matched data (no internal scoring)
2. Scoring engine handles ALL scoring logic consistently
3. No ComponentScoreCalculator usage in strategies
