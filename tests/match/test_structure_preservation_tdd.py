TDD test for structure preservation in composite brush workflow.

This test ensures that when a composite brush is:
1. Regex matched -> data/matched (nested structure)
2. Saved to correct_matches.yaml
3. Rehydrated via CorrectMatchesStrategy

The rehydrated structure should be IDENTICAL to the original regex match structure.
