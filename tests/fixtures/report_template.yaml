    ## Observations

    * [Observations will be generated based on data analysis]

    ## Notes & Caveats

    * I only show the top n results per category to keep the tables readable and avoid max post length issues.

    * The unique user column shows the number of different users who used a given brand/soap/etc in the month.

    * The Brand Diversity table details the number of distinct soaps used during the month from that particular brand.

    * The change Î” vs columns show how an item has moved up or down the rankings since that month. = means no change in position, up or down arrows indicate how many positions up or down the rankings an item has moved compared to that month. n/a means the item was not present in that month.
